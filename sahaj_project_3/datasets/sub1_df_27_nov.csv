Just need to vent...,"I get that tempers are shorter these days, but I am having a hard time lately with people taking out their frustrations on me, because I happen to be convenient.

I work in an inbound support call centre, and we try very hard not to release the call if possible.  But I spoke to a real “Special” person today.

She’s going to file a complaint because I pointed out that she violated our terms of use.

I am so close to being done with all of this....  (the job, I mean)


Thanks for the awards!

Reverse call center post,"On mobile so I hope I do this right.  

I had to call about a bill we keep getting for trash service we cancelled September 5th.  At first it was $13.  Called and they cancelled that.   Now it is $45 bucks.  Administration fees and trash can removal.  Oh and a late fee on the first bill we received of this.  

So I call in.  The woman says I don’t know why the other people haven’t told you about this.  We can’t take anything off. 

I took a deep breath... because honestly this is BS.   then I replied with “ I really want to vent but I know you don’t make the rules and I honestly don’t want to end up on Reddit Tales from the call center”.   She muffled a giggle.  And apologized profusely.  But still couldn’t do anything.  

I told her that sucks but I wouldn’t take it out on her since it isn’t her fault.  She said thank you and we ended our call.  

So hopefully I made someone’s day by not yelling and instead getting them to laugh.  

Still ticked off about the situation though.",39,0,0
"""So you're willing to lose a customer for $3 dollars?""","I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

Many calls. Many angry customers. Gonna drink myself to sleep tonight, but before that I'll share these two tales.

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C1: First customer

So before transferring me the customer, the agent who received the call explained me the situation: Customer wants to make a one day reservation both pick up and drop off at the Sacramento International Airport.

When booking a reservation, you have two options: pay at the counter and pay in advance. If you pay in advance, you get a better rate. The customer was requesting a supervisor because she wanted to pay at the counter, but get the prepay rate, which in my opinion is an idiotic request. Whatever, I'll set the record straight and move on.

C1: They told me that if I pay in advance the rate will be 38 USD, and if I pay at the counter it'll be 41 USD, but I never pay in advance, can you do something about it?

H: I do apologize for the inconvenience ma'am, but it's not possible to give you the prepay rate if you don't pay in advance.

C1: Don't you have a discount or a coupon?

H: No ma'am, I don't have any coupons available and I don't see any specials right now.

C1: What's the base rate you have?

H: 23.99 USD

C1: Why is that? I'm on your website and it shows 22 USD.

H: It is possible that the website has its own special right now. I know it's weird, but even though we're the same company, sometimes the website has better rates than my department...

C1: What about that wholesale food company that sells those bigass slices of pizza (not what she actually said, she just mentioned the name of the wholesale food company), I have a membership, don't you guys offer a discount for that?

Oh God... she's a member of that Company... I've had some **really bad experiences** with them. 

H: Yes, we do have a partnership with them. 

C1: How can I apply the discount? I don't see any options on the website.

This call was taking longer than expected...

H: I'd strongly recommend you go to their website, specifically Wholesale Food Company that sells those bigass slices of pizza Travel dot com.

C1: Why would I need to do that? Why can't I do it on your website?

Guess I won't get rid of her anytime soon, might as well just make her a reservation and move on.

H: That's okay, I'll add the discount myself, can you please provide me your membership number?

She provides me her membership number...

H: Very well, with unlimited miles, taxes and fees included and your discount, it will be 38 USD...

C1: Pay at the counter?

H: Pay at the counter...

I'll admit, that felt wholesome.

So I'm just asking her for basic information like her e-mail, phone number, we even laughed at one point, then...

C1: And this is for a Ford Fusion car, right?

Goddammit...

H: No ma'am, this is for an Intermediate size vehicle like a Corolla or Chevy Cruze.

C1: What? No, I told the agent that I wanted a Full Size car like a Ford Fusion.

I check to see the rate for a Full Size car, and much to my dismay...

H: A Full Size vehicle would be 42 USD

C1: Don't you have like an upgrade coupon?

I check, but I couldn't find an upgrade coupon, not that it would help, if I attached that type of coupon she would get a Standard Size vehicle anyways, not a Full Size.

H: I'm truly sorry ma'am, but this is the best rate I can offer. Should I proceed with the reservation?

C1: Pffft... No. So you're willing to lose a customer just for 3 dollars?

H: I can't go any lower, sorry.

C1: Guess I'll have to go with another company, I won't rent from you guys anymore.

H: So be it, sorry to hear that.

C1: Wait... did you just say ""so be it""?

H: ... Yeah?

C1: Tcht, such great customer service you have.

Then I can hear her in the background ""can you believe this? He just told me ""so be it"".

*Click*

Nearly 10 minutes trying to assist this bitch just for her to tell me ""are you willing to lose a customer just for 3 dollars?"". Don't like the rate? Feel free to shop around. Such a novelty concept, which leads to the following story where I had to deal with this asshole:

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C2: Second customer

C2: Hey HenriquesDumbCousin, so I just made a Reservation at the Hard Rock Hotel and I liked the rate (it was like 200 USD), but then I realized that I made the Reservation wrong. I selected both pick up and drop off at the Hard Rock Hotel, but I need to return the vehicle at the Orlando International Airport.

H: Uh-huh...

C2: But when I tried to fix my mistake, the rate of the Reservation increased 200 USD more! What's up with that?

H: I do apologize for that, sir. Most of the time round trips are cheaper when compared to one way rentals.

C2: But Hard Rock and Orlando International are very close!

H: If that's the case, in order to avoid any issues, I'd strongly recommend you return the vehicle at Hard Rock and take a Taxi or an Uber to Orlando International.

C2: No, no, you don't understand, I don't want to return the vehicle at Hard Rock, I want to drop it at Orlando International.

H: I'm truly sorry sir, but there's nothing I can do.

C2: But it's not even a one way rental, I mean, I'm dropping the vehicle in the same city.

H: But you're dropping it in a different location.

Customer continues to request that we do something for him.

C2: There has to be something you can do for me HenriquesDumbCousin. 

H: My hands are tied, sir. That's the best rate we have for you, if you don't like that rate I'd strongly recommend you shop around.

*Awkward silence*

C2: What... what did you just say to me?

H: Ummm... you're welcome to shop around? I mean, you may find a better rate with another company.

C2: Are you even allowed to say that? 

H: Pardon me?

C2: HenriquesDumbCousin, I need to speak with a higher up, who do you answer to?

For fuck's sake.

H: I can't share that person's information and he doesn't take any calls. Sir, I'm sorry, but this is the best rate we can offer, if you don't like it we won't force you to pay for it, this is America after all.

C2: ""This is America""? So now you're mocking me.

What the fuck is wrong with this guy?

C2: You think I wouldn't know that? Of course I can go with another company, you think I haven't thought about that? Let me tell you, HenriquesDumbCousin, I own several businesses...

H: Not impressive...

C2: AND IF YOU WERE ONE OF MY EMPLOYEES...

H: NOT IMPRESSIVE!!!

H: Asshole...

Accidentally Exposed a Family Fraud,"I work for a small local ISP.  One of the things I sometime do is help out the billing person &amp; call people whose credit cards have failed to process.

We have a lot of elderly customers &amp; not so elderly customers with adult children currently in the home.  In order for us to be able to speak with these people &amp; troubleshoot, service issues or discuss billing issues,  they have to be named as ""authorized contacts"".  It is perfectly normal for our customer Charles Smith to have Mary, Jane &amp; Kevin Smith listed as contacts &amp; for Jane Smith to be the name on the credit card.

Normal process in the case of a credit card fail is call the customer first, regardless of whose name is on the card. 95% of the time the customer gives us another card &amp; we move on.  The other 5% they either direct us to the card holder or say they will ask the card holder to call us.  If the card holder doesn't contact us, we reach out to them in a day or so.

Charles Smith has card in the name of Jane Smith on his account.  It failed &amp; the billing person called him  &amp; Charles said he'd ask Jane to call.  Jane didn't call so a few days later I called Jane.

Jane had no idea why I was calling about a credit card. She isn't paying the bill, her dad is.  I explained the card on file was in her name &amp; gave her the last 4 digits.  She said she has no card that ends in them &amp; I must be mistaken about the card.  I said the card had been on the account for 4 months, under her name &amp; that my coworker had spoken to her dad &amp; her dad had said he would get Jane to call us.  Again, I must be mistaken, she doesn't pay this bill &amp; I need to sort this with her dad.

I call Charles, get voice mail, leave &amp; message &amp; life goes on at internetsRus until next month when Charles' card fails again.  Billing person calls him, gets told again that Jane will call him.  Jane fails to call &amp; I call her.  This time Jane conferences in Charles in the call.  Charles tries to obfuscate the issue &amp; blames us for misunderstanding him. I point out I have the call records &amp; we can all listen to them if they give me a few minutes.  Charles says there is no need, he'll go find his wallet &amp; call me back.  A guy calls, says he's Kevin Smith &amp; gives us a new card.

4 months later it begins to fail &amp; we call Kevin.  Surprise! Kevin has no idea what we are talking about &amp; it's a repeat of Jane's call.  The second time it fails though Kevin says he'll have to call us back.  A few days later he asks for copies of the invoices his card was charged to. Then Jane calls &amp; requests the same.  Eventually we got a visit from the cops with paperwork asking for our billing &amp; call records with Charles Smith.  

No details on why at that time, but some of the cops are gossipy sorts &amp; we share a building complex with a police station &amp; the cops are often in our building meeting with various lawyers &amp; such.  So it was only a matter time before one of my smoker coworkers  met up with a smoker cop &amp; found out that Charles Smith was arrested for identity theft &amp; his kids were the victims.  Small town local gossip puts it at over $250,000 dollars worth of charges on cards opened in the kids' names.  Not sure if that is true &amp; his only mention in the news was under the ""Arrests this Week"" column, for fraud.  We're all interested to see how it plays out.

TL:DR  Parent steals kids' identity, commits fraud, eventually is found out &amp; arrested when he doesn't pay his internet bill.",958,0,0
"""I can hear you...""","So this was back in April after I first started working from home.

We were given new headsets with a mute button on for silent holds which I used pretty frequently to either bitch about my customers or just cough/sneeze. You know, the usual stuff. I'm also a pretty loud talker on the phone, I have relatively poor hearing so I've always been a pretty loud person but I'd also had a couple comments from people saying they couldn't hear me on the phone  since WFH.

So I'm helping this guy with his order, and I tell him I'm gonna go quiet for a couple mins whilst I put it through for him.

At this point, I start singing (very loudly and very badly) ""oooh whatya saay"" (yeah, THAT song), and my partner shouts me from upstairs asking:

 ""Why are you so loud when you're on the phone?!""

Me: ""Because if I'm not loud nobody can fucking hear me!""

Customer: ""Oh I can hear you""

Me: *heart drops* ""Oh sorry about that... Just working from home problems y'know *nervous laughter hoping the call isn't listened to*?""

Customer: ""Haha yeah...""

At this point I *swiftly* wrapped up the call and curled up on my sofa to die for a while before moving onto my next one. I don't know if I've ever been more fearful for my job than in that moment but thankfully I never heard about it again.

Few things I wondered at the end of this call:
1 - how many fucking people have I talked shit about and have blatantly heard me
2 - what the hell was this guy thinking when he heard me spontaneously come out with singing in the middle of a phone call
3 - WHY DIDNT HE SAY ANYTHING BEFORE I SWORE 

I did mention the fact that the mute button didn't seem to be working for me to my manager and apparently it was/is a known problem.",84,0,0
Mom ruins sons credit and blames us,"I work in a call center for a bank. This bank finances auto loans. So most of our calls pertain to car payments or our website.

Had a lady call in earlier today. We can call her Karen for obvious reasons. As she calls in, an account pops up with a male name attached. I learn quickly that its her sons car and loan. He had previously called in at the beginning of this month to permanently authorize her on the account. Meaning I have permission to speak with her.

She calls in, I do my standard greeting. I'm cut off about half way through with ""Yeah, yeah, I know. The call is recorded. I've heard it before. I've been on hold forever and we need to fix something right now."" Great. This should be fun.

I glance over the account quickly while she's verifying the information. I notice the account is only a few months old and there's already a late payment marked on the account. Meaning a payment went over a month past due so we reported it as late to the credit bureaus. Sure enough, after verifying the account she hits me with the old ""We made a payment on time and your company screwed up and now its affecting my sons credit and he's trying to buy a house and he can't now blah blah blah"". Its very common for customers to blame us when a payment is late. They think we don't keep records of our calls. I don't know.

So this lady claims that her son called in a week before his first payment was even due. He made a payment using his checking account. She claims we must have taken down the numbers wrong because the payment never came out. A month goes by and thats when they realize the account was behind. They get it caught up but its too late. The damage is done. She wants that credit mark removed since we messed up.

Now, even if that entire story were true and we took down the numbers wrong, the chances of us doing anything about the credit mark are slim. For multiple reasons. But I decide to humor her a bit. I tell her that I'll pull the call from that day, review it, and if she's correct and we took the information down wrong, I can pass along the account. I made sure to mention that even if that was the case, I can't promise anything.

So I pull the call and listen. And boy oh boy.

To start, it wasn't even the son (the account holder) calling in. It was VERY CLEARLY the same woman I had just spoken with. However this was BEFORE her son had authorized us to speak with her. So she lied about who she was and claimed to be the son. The son has a gender neutral name and the mom was able to verify his birthday/social, so that representative believed her. But regardless, she lied about her identity. That's considered fraud. Strike one.

Secondly, she did not call in early. The account was actually over a week behind. On its first payment. And it was made clear to her within the first 30 seconds of the call. The representative specifically told her it was a week behind and asked why that was the case. The mother claimed something about COVID. So she lied again about when she tried to make the payment. Strike two.

Third, during the processing of the payment, the representative specifically read back both the routing number and the account number for the checking account. The mom confirmed the information was correct. So her main claim about us taking the information down incorrectly was also a lie. She GAVE us the wrong information. Strike three.

On top of all of that, we called her sons phone every day and left messages. We sent bills stating the account was past due. The son had the account registered online and never bothered to log in to check that his first payment went through. And they clearly never checked the bank account to make sure the payment had come out. This is literally 100% on them. 

I had the pleasure of calling the woman back to inform her the waiver request was denied. That call may be good for a separate post. But she did not take it kindly and demanded to speak with the manager that listened to the call. Imagine her shock when I let her know that I had listened to the call myself.

Tl;dr don't let anyone else manage bills that are technically your responsibility. This guys credit is now hit pretty hard because he left it in the hands of his mother. Try not to feel bad for him. He's in his mid to late 20s and should be handling his own finances. Especially if he IS trying to buy a house. Which is hard to believe considering Karen lied about everything else.

EDIT: For those asking, the son definitely knew about the loan. Not only would he have had to have been at the dealership to sign the contract, but there was notes in the account that we spoke to both the son and the mom during the call where the son authorized her on the account.",725,0,0
Creepy....stop talking please.,"Just happened now. 

Placing an order for a gentleman. When I first answered the phone the voice was that of an older woman with a smokers voice. When I asked for verification of account info the voice changed to a man and he laughed. He was doing an impression. Ok cool.

He then jokes about his last name which is close to a swear. Ok fine. 

Then he starts making immature jokes about breasts, farts, poop and sex. Um....ok.

THEN he let me know he was in his 60s and he has a 21 year old girlfriend from the Philippines that he brought to the states and he loves now domesticated she is. That's... disturbing. 

He ends the call by asking if I'm single.

Today I hung up on a rude customer,"Hey there, I’m still fairly new here and still new to working in a call center. I made my first post here only yesterday. 

I just got off the phone with a customer who was extremely upset her exercise equipment delivery was pushed back to January. The reason she was given by the girl who took the call before me was because the warehouse reported inclement weather.

I did everything I could to try to deescalate her. I gave her a partial refund. I offered to get her in touch with a supervisor. I told her, odds are, she will get bumped back up soon as most people are. I tried to set her mind at ease about how she “would be put in the back of the delivery schedule” by telling her that isn’t true. I tried to keep calm but she continued to berate and belittle me. 

So I hung up. And I blamed it on internet connectivity and browser issues. The “training” we were put through was hardly training at all and I’m not an actual employee with this exercise company. I don’t know the best ways to make a person relax over the phone when they’re going off the rails. But I couldn’t take being berated anymore by this woman. I was shaking and hearing her talk shit about me to her husband in the background was too overwhelming. When I went to reassure her she would talk over me and insult me.

I usually recognize their anger isn’t directed to me personally but to me this one particular call felt personal. I’m a bit nervous about the possible consequences I might face if someone finds out I purposely hung up on her but I tried to hold it together as best as I would while I had her on the phone and did everything I knew to do to try to ease her. 

I hope this gets easier. I don’t dislike this job but feeling the brunt of people’s misdirected anger is really so exhausting. I’m not paid much to begin with but I’m definitely not paid enough to be insulted even when I exhaust everything I know to do in these particular situations. 

Has this happened to you? Any advice? Is there ever a situation where this is okay within your own companies? Was it not okay? I feel a bit gross as a person currently but I’m not kidding when I say I did everything I was trained to do when a person is like this but I couldn’t continue letting her insult me..",17,0,0

Entering wife's policy because you work in corporate and making a complaint about the price - get fired.,"When I worked for a car insurance company I received a complaint from one of my staff about a renewal price.

He'd told them on the phone he knew the commission levels on the policy and knew we could offer a better discount than the one we applied as a retention tool. He was not nice at all to my staff member. 

The language he used showed he had clear working knowledge of our systems and processes. A quick search for his name on the company message service shows he's in the corporate office.

I emailled my manager and said this wasn't appropriate, there were clear footprints in the policy showing when he'd accessed it over the past month or so and had played with the commissions himself to try and get favourable prices.

"""You are being sued! You ripped us off! To settle this lawsuit send $500 a month in a check made out to cash to P.O. Box XXXX Los Angeles CA""","A little over a decade ago, I was doing Customer Service for a cell phone company.  Sometimes that meant taking calls, sometimes that meant answering incoming customer complaint letters. . .and calling the customer back to discuss their complaint.

This was probably the weirdest letter I got though, and that is saying something:

We got what appeared to be a faded and distorted photocopy of some legal papers dated September, 1985 (this was in 2009) about a law firm in L.A. filing some motion against the city for something involving a building permit for a greenhouse. 

However, most of the actual legal paperwork was crossed out and had various things over it. The city of Los Angeles, as defendant, was crossed out with a pen and had the name of our company written on it. 

The plaintiffs address was crossed out and had ""Address not available"" written there. 

The letterhead for the Law Firm had the words ""Lawyer for suing Cell Phone company!"" written beside it and underlined and an arrow going from those words to the letterhead. 

The entire body of the letter was crossed out with what looked like a sharpie, and handwritten in the margins beside it in pen was: 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You are being sued!   
&gt;  
&gt;You ripped us off!   
&gt;  
&gt;To settle this lawsuit send $500 a month in a check made out to cash to P.O. Box XXXX Los Angeles CA

&amp;#x200B;

There was no contact information other than a P.O. Box, not even a name of who was ""suing"" us since it demanded checks made out to cash to be sent to a PO Box. 

I decided to not forward it to legal and treat it as an unidentifiable crank letter.  There was nobody I could call, and even if I could, we were supposed to send legal paperwork to the Legal department and not contact the person who filed. . .but this obviously wasn't a legitimate legal filing.  It was just. . .a mess.

"I helped someone in trouble - hopefully, I don't get in trouble lol.","Hey everyone, it's-a me-a krazy-a.  Back at working pest control sales.  Boy, do I have a story for you.

My possible client was telling me over the phone how she was terrified of mice and they are invading the home she is renting. She told me her landlord has refused to do anything about it and this is the second year. She then told me she has a newborn on top of having a fear of mice. I totally understand the fear for the safety of her child, as mice can carry fleas and diseases.

I couldn't set up services with her, just her landlord though. I tried to ask some more questions to understand the condition of the house we were working with more (ie are there holes the mice got in and stuff).

She told me about how the ceiling was leaking (the landlord did nothing about it), and now the basement backed up this March from the septic tank and the landlord never cleaned it. I was aghast. The amount of possible mold on top of SEWAGE, my dear readers, LEFTOVER SEWAGE, that the landlord refused to treat was inhumane and unbelievable. She and her husband have a newborn baby for goodness sake.

I had to do something. I looked up the local code enforcement office for the city and gave her the office number as the house qualified for emergency servicing from what I skimmed on their website. I also told her what the local government website was and how I was able to Google it so that she can find it easier. She said she will call tomorrow morning and I am so excited for her!

Did I mention the landlord's increased rent during the lockdown and had the nerve to tell her that if she wants to rent month to month, it is $300 extra a month for the conditions the landlord has let happen to the house? Not to mention it is in a bad neighborhood where gunshots are heard all the time. Oh no. Sigh. I felt so bad for her and hopefully, the landlord will either let her out of the lease without a $1,000 FEE! That's right folks, $1,000!! And they can't even be bothered to fix a leaky roof, much less SEWAGE ROTTING IN THE BASEMENT. Oh, and mice. Did I mention the mold from the leaky roof? It's definitely there on top of in the basement.

I noted this in my personal notes as if the landlord does come to us for pest control, I want the technicians to be aware of possible health hazards, plus I was on the phone for WAAAAY longer than I needed to be. But this young lady my age needed help, and I couldn't just stand there and do nothing. She didn't know where to start to check legal rights for renters.

Karen is mad she has to put in the effort for us to be able to help her.," 

Long story short, I help take calls for pest control companies.

A Karen calls in, upset that in the email we sent her, we told her that to put down the products and baits needed for ants and other pests, she needs to empty out her cupboards and drawers in the kitchen and replace the paper on the bottom.

She whined how it was too much work and how other companies didn't do that and only came twice a year, which dear readers, most do not do anymore (source: I work 3rd party for over 50 pest control companies, some of which are nation-wide, some local. Basically no one does this because it takes super harsh and dangerous chemicals) I tried to source how we have been open since before WWII, but alas, this is too much work for Karen, so she is canceling. LOL.

Like fr, what are you expecting, us to guarantee something when we can't do our job right? No! Like, yeah, it's an inconvenience, but who is the expert here Karen, us, or you?

Lol, good luck to the next pest control company. If her cupboards were that bad, that means that she really needed us. Roll of eyes people. Rolle of eyes.",20,0,0
I hung up on a customer without warning them,"I have been working for a bank for the past 3 years. I consider myself to be a pretty relaxed and laid back person so I don’t feel like I get in battles frequently with the customers. 

Countless times I’ve called customer service and feel like the customer service I got was awful so I don’t want others to go through that. I also really enjoy my job and feeling like I’ve helped someone with their issue. 

That said, there are still some calls where I’d love to just hang up but I’ve never done it (with the exception of once. 30 seconds into a call a guy said he was gonna cum on my face; wtf?) 

Where I work we have been told if we are put in an abusive situation we must warn the customer prior to terminating and give them a chance to cool down. 

I have had to give the “hey, I’d like to keep this call professional” warning a few times before and it works wonders. 

I didn’t today. No warning. Just hung up. 

For some background, our bank is strict about certain fee waivers. There are fees that we are not able to waive at all, even if we tried. There is literally no button for it- if we think it’s a bank error we can send a notice to a much higher up supervisor. But it has to be a serious situation or we will get in trouble when they ask *my* supervisor why we are requesting them for fee waivers. 

I had a guy call in and immediately hit me with a bunch of questions, some of them, I wasn’t even able to answer because it was outside of my realm of expertise or I legally could not because he was asking sensitive info about his banking relationship and I did not have access to that. It was outside the realm of what a customer service rep normally would have access to. It would be like asking your pizza delivery driver for legal and tax advice and then asking him to solve a complicated calculus equation and recite a Shakespearean soliloquy from heart. 

I tried to calm him down and explain what I knew. “Sir, you’re behind on your payment because there was a balance due on [due date]). I do not have access to that other information as I am a customer service rep but in typical situations here is how it goes...”

He let the difficult questions go at that point. What was important was that it wasn’t his fault that he was late on his payment so I need to waive fees.

“Sir, we sent a statement by mail stating this payment was due by [due date].” I said. 

Well, we promised him by phone he didn’t have to pay. 

“I’m very sorry we misinformed you, sir, but we sent this in writing that a payment was due.” 

Well, he tried to pay by phone but we were closed. So I need to waive fees. 

“I apologize sir, but we do not waive fees. (Don’t agree with it, but it’s not my company) Sir, I do not know why you were misinformed and can’t comprehend why that happened and I apologize. I show that we sent a statement by mail a month ago stating a payment was due.” 

The man starts acting belligerent and I hear him and a woman yelling at each other and talking trash about me like I was not there and couldn’t hear it. He said I told him to “pay now or I’ll report him to the credit bureaus” (I said no such thing, never even implied this), that I “can’t see anything and can’t help” and essentially just seemed to craft a narrative about how I was refusing to help when it was completely opposite. He just didn’t want to accept the help and wanted to be a victim. 

He then starts handing the phone to random people. Every time a new person comes on the line (including being put on speaker phone) we have to warn that the call is being recorded (for legal reasons in some states) and ask who I’m speaking with. If I am not speaking with someone not on the file, I can’t release any info. 

Woman (call her Anne) is put on the phone and states her full name after I state the recording blurb. 

“I’m Anne Doe, look we really just need these fees waived. Can you please just waive them because I want to finish cleaning, please just waive them.” 

This call is already going south and I feel uncomfortable as I’ve already said no. On top of that, the customer constantly switching the phone between people is confusing, so I figure maybe I will see if there are any type of fees I can credit back that will please them. 

I ask Anne to wait a second and let me look. 

There are no fees I can credit back. 

“Anne, I’m sorry about the wait. I can’t waive any fees. It does not allow me to, our bank does not waive these fees.” 

“So you can’t waive the fees?”

“No, I’m sorry.” 

Anne puts me on speaker phone and goes ballistic. “TELL ME WHY! TELL ME WHY!” She begins shrieking. 

“Okay, wait just a moment.” At this point, I raise my voice and become firm. “I need to know everyone I’m speaking with.” I read the disclosure about recording. 

“No!” Anne shrieks. “You can’t answer my question! Answer it! What is wrong with you?! Is something the matter with you? Just do your job!” 

She is going absolutely nuts and my blood starts boiling. I knew raising my voice was a mistake, but her behavior completely caught me off guard. Perhaps there was a better way to handle it but I was stunned with how quickly her behavior had changed. 

“Ma’am, I need to know who I’m speaking with before I proceed. Who all is in the room?”

“You know who it is and you’re avoiding my question!” Anne was completely belligerent and shouting insults into the phone. And then. She *mocked* me. “Hello? Hello? You gonna pretend to hang up? This call may be monitored or recorded. Hello? Hello?” She sounded like an 8 year old. 

I went silent, kind of froze. I had no idea what to say or do. I didn’t even want to give this person the chance to play nice. I let her scream at and mock me for about 30 seconds and then just... *click*. I was thinking.. what do I say to move this conversation forward? Do I jump in and give another opportunity to this person to attempt to bully and gaslight me? I just didn’t want to put up with it, consequences be damned. 

Admittedly, I don’t remember if she said anything extremely awful. I just remember the belligerent, sometimes incoherent screaming and lastly I think that the “what’s wrong with you” thing really bothered me because I have been a victim of gaslighting like this before. Made to feel like I was completely crazy for something that was unproblematic and a reasonable boundary for me to set. It definitely triggered something in me and I didn’t want to continue to take this. 

Here’s the kicker. You know how much the fees were? 

It was for a single dollar. This woman and man had gone ballistic over having to pay a dollar after not paying the balance owed for *multiple* months. 🤔 

Unless I’m given a reason otherwise, I believe what the customer says. One of our reps screwed up. They didn’t get their statement. They were freaked out about the bill because they’ve never used a bank product and was scared to call. Whatever. 

But in this instance this guy had already called us multiple times to complain and was behind multiple months. On top of that, he actually was granted a fee waiver 6 months prior when the same thing happened. He seemed to use credit, carry a balance and not pay. Decide to pay after multiple missed payments, and then raise hell with our reps to get out of the consequences that come after not paying your bill on time. 


So yeah. This call happened a while back so I’m comfortable with sharing this story. I wrote this the day it happened and just waited a while. 

I never got in trouble for hanging up and I don’t know if I ever got caught.",47,0,0
I’m sorry you can’t get what you want in a pandemic,"I’ve been working for a call center for almost a month now. Specifically, I take calls for a very popular upscale exercise equipment brand. 

Due to Covid-19, ports are slowed down exponentially so there’s a shortage of inventory in the continental US. We went from having approximately 100 pieces of exercise equipment per cargo ship to only 50. Because of quarantines, demand has also skyrocketed so there’s very few pieces of equipment to go around. Warehouses are also having to close because of staffing issues related to Covid so that’s pushing delivery dates even further back.

All day I get berated by customers for not being able to give them their overpriced exercise equipment right at this second. Most customers are on the wealthier end and expect instant gratification immediately despite the fact we are in a pandemic and I cannot help beyond being a communication bridge between our customers and delivery partners. Some of our wait times are 3 months or longer because of all these factors. I don’t like it but it’s completely out of my control and I wish people would realize this instead of feel the need to be so mean.

Does it get easier? I’m working this job from home after losing my old job due to Covid and while I like the convenience, some days just feel like too much. I can’t give people the answers they want as much as I wish I could and being berated all day is already wearing on me.",32,0,0
To the dude that wouldn’t let me get a word in edgewise about his bill.,"
You suck. Seriously. I work for the company. I know how our policies work. I really wish I could’ve told you to shut the fuck up and let me explain. What happened you might ask?

He called in wanting to know why his current monthly charge was $404. I tried explaining the charges, which part of came from a Covid payment plan he had signed up for back in June. The plan spilt the bill from June into 4 equal payments starting in July, ending in October. His bill for October is due today (and he’s seriously just now calling in to complain?). According to him, he only had to pay 2 payments of $400, and that he had already done so. He would absolutely not accept when I tried exposing that A. There was no record or noted of him being told that and B. The CPP was 4 equal payments for everyone, plain and simple. Nope. Not according to him. Most of the call was him arguing about it with me. I then tried to get him over to an L2 to have them explain it. But he had enough. He told me to let his account get cut off and he’ll go seek business elsewhere, and ended the call. Fucking idiot.",367,0,0
I hate it when people escalate over petty nonsense.," I respect my managers a lot and genuinely feel bad that I have to pass this pointless shit off to them. It's been bad for escalations/assholes in general this past week or so.

\- Lady wanted to make some crazy change to her site that we could not in any way support (the stuff she wanted to do would basically require her to move to a different service who could support the changes she wanted). I told her what changes we COULD make and offered to assist with them. She says, ""Thanks but I don't think I believe you. Can I schedule a call with someone else?""

\- Dude also wanted to make some crazy changes to his site. Now, the changes *he* wanted were within our ability to make, but he was basically just an employee of the client the account actually belongs to and has no authorization to make any changes like that. We told him any changes would have to come from the account owner. Guy demanded to speak to a manager and that if he doesn't get a call from someone before Thanksgiving, ""we'll have to deal with him and his team of lawyers"". Sure, Jan.

\- Another woman was having some issues with contact records in her account. I asked her for examples of these issues. She got pissed off and said she ""didn't have time to do my job for me"" and demanded it go to management. Management asked her the same question. She got all pissy at them too, but ended up eventually sending examples over the weekend - I assume once she'd taken her anti-psychotics.

\- Someone wanted their ticket escalated because ""no one called them"". Said ticket was one of those that just had ""call me xxx-xxx-xxxx"" with no other info. We do not call people immediately when they send in those types of cases for several reasons, and instead direct them to our hours and to either call us or reply back explaining what they need help with. This person was saying they ""scheduled a call"" and no one replied to them.

It's Thanksgiving, you lunatics. Go get some turkey and booze and calm the hell down.",27,0,0

I *actually* *enjoy* speaking with the worst Karens,"Hey there. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I am one of the few who genuinely enjoys working in a BPO and speaking with the worst callers there.


Like for example, the other day there was this Karen who must have called me several derogatory terms since her computer was not working. It turns out that she did not plug it at all. All that making an ass out of herself out of sheer stupidity. We have an SOP on releasing calls for extreme behavior, but I generally am one of the few who does not disconnect on these instances as it is music to my ears.


There was also this woman who was violently disputing her CC transactions about prolly 29.99/month for the past year or so, the line item is not detailed thats why she had to call, and upon investigating, it turns out it was a Grindr subscription made by her husband who she totally thought was straight (I heard their confrontation and some glass/furniture breaking, too bad there is an SOP for unreponsive customers, I did not get to hear how their fight played out. I like revelations and betrayals.

You can’t contact a merchant for me? Cancel my account!,"This is for a credit card company. Guy calls and says he has a transaction from a merchant twice and it was approved! But I need to get involved because... he can’t figure out how to reach the merchant. He should only be charged once! 

Sorry, but credit card companies can’t contact merchants on customer behalf, you just contact the merchant to handle pending transactions. Most duplicate transactions are automatically reversed within 8 business days. Also, approved transactions are not yet posted. It takes up to 8 days for transactions to post. Only a posted transaction can be disputed and it is better to deal with the merchant directly for any issues. If the merchant has no resolution. We can attempt to help resolve the issue after it posts. We can mark any transaction to notify customers when it posts to the account...

Well, since I can’t call the merchant and correct the issue for him right now with a pending transaction he wanted his account canceled.

"PPI refund £3000 - your debt £5000, didn't read the contract you signed, enjoy.","Back when PPI (Payment Protection Insurance) was a massive scandal in the UK, I worked in a PPI complaints department for a pretty bad credit card company. This American card company gave cards to those noone else would dare, leading to a lot of bad debts.

If PPI was mis-sold we would issue a letter offering a refund amount for the customer to accept, sign and return. Underneath the signature area was a very important statement ""If your account is not in good standing, this refund will be used to offset any debt and the remainder will be paid to you within X weeks of returning"".

At least 8 times a day I'd have to explain to a customer why they weren't receiving their refund for xxxx amount, due to their account being in bad debt status how we'd reduced their debt for their own benefit as per the instruction under their signature. Amazing how many customers had already spent their refunds before receiving them, and didn't understand that having a payment plan for £10 a month with collections on a £7000 debt meant they were up to date with their payments and should recieve their refunds.

Customer threatens to complain to FOS for not being entitled to a refund after receiving a payout for his claim,"This happened a few years ago so I don’t remember the exact conversation. I also don’t expect everyone to be experts on insurance but you would think that certain things are obvious, especially when you have documents that clearly state it.

For those that never had to deal with uk insurance or know much about it, here’s the important bit. FOS is the financial ombudsman service. If a customer is not satisfied with a complaint they can escalate this to FOS who will investigate further and basically decide who’s in the right, there’s a bit more to it but as an insurer we would have to comply with their decision.

Also the way our policies work is they are 12 month contracts. Like most insurance the agreement is basically you pay £x amount and for (12 months) if you need to make a claim you are covered. So although you can call to cancel mid term, if you’ve claimed and we pay out you’re not entitled to any refund as the contract fairly states.

This customer had taken out pet insurance with us and had been renewing for a few years until his pet sadly passed away. So after speaking to our claims team and being told he would receive a payout they transferred him to me to cancel.

I confirmed that the policy had now been cancelled and sympathised with his pet passing away. He then asked when he would be receiving his refund. I tried to explain that as he had made a claim and would be receiving a payout he isn’t entitled to a pro rata refund for cancelling. He then got annoyed with this answer saying that’s illegal and we have to refund him as he’s cancelling. I try and explain as clearly as I can the contract and even said his logic wouldn’t make any sense but he just wouldn’t understand and continued to get more annoyed.

After trying my best to explain he said he will be taking this further to FOS as we’re breaking the law and trying to scam him. At this point I just gave up and said ok if that’s how you feel would you like me to make an official complaint as FOS will not just accept any complaint with a customer unless they have exhausted all of the insurers complaint procedure first. He declined saying he has already done this and will be going straight to them. I just thought fair enough I’ve done everything I can and the call ended.

I did check his file after to see the complaint and saw that it was for something completely unrelated. I can’t remember what it was but remember thinking it was stupid so explains why this person was so difficult to deal with. Anyway knew he would have to come back to us because of this as FOS will just turn him down when they discover the complaint isn’t related so I kept my eye on the policy for a while to see if anything came of it. As far as I can tell the customer never followed up and that was the end of it.",224,0,0

"""That's why I hate speaking with people from other countries!""","tl;dr customer fucked around, found out

I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C: Customer

H: Thank you for calling Rental Car Company, my name is HenriquesDumbCousin, may I have your name?

C: Where are you located HenriquesDumbCousin?

To me, this is always a red flag. Each and every customer that has asked me this ends up being a complete twat who has no problem blaming people from other countries instead of admitting that they fucked up.

H: California

C: California?

H: Yes sir, California. How can I assist you today?

So the customer tells me that after 30 days with the vehicle he wishes to extend his reservation for an additional 29 days.

**TECHNICAL PART STARTS HERE**

In the General Reservations department, reservations can only last 59 days. If the customer wants to rent the vehicle for a longer amount of time, they need to speak with the Mini-Lease department. 

Now, this part is tricky, if the customer makes a reservation for less than 30 days, they're only allowed to extend the reservation 3 times and it cannot exceed the 30 day limit.

If the reservation was made for more than 30 days, it cannot be extended at any point.

For example, if the customer made the Reservation for 1 days, they can only extend the Reservation 3 times and it can only be for 29 more days.

If the customer made the Reservation for 15 days, they can only extend the Reservation 3 times and it can only be for 15 more days.

If the customer made the Reservation for 40 days , they can't extend it anymore.

**TECHNICAL PART ENDS HERE**

H: I do apologize, but it won't be possible, we cannot exceed the 30 day limit...

C: But the agent told me that customers can make reservations for a period of 59 days!

H: Yes, but such decisions need to be made before picking up the vehicle. Once you get a contract, it's not possible to extend it more than 30 days.

The original reservation was merely a week. The customer called and extended the reservation until he reached the 30 day limit.

C: So you're telling me that I should have made the reservation for 59 days?

H: That is correct, sir.

C: See? This is a problem HenriquesDumbCousin, the person I spoke with yesterday, I think she told me she was from India, she told me that I could extend the rental for 29 more days! I already made plans, this is a big inconvenience!

I honestly doubt the customer is being honest here. I suspect he  just called and asked how long could a rental be without sharing more information. The agent, not knowing that it was an active reservation, told him that they can be up to 59 days and that's it. Otherwise, why did the customer didn't extend the reservation at that precise moment? 

Regardless, it was his own fuck up, he waited until the reservation was nearly over to extend it for another month, not to mention if it was such an inconvenience to close the current contract and get a new one at the location, that means he acted before consulting us in the first place.

H: I would strongly recommend to return the vehicle to the location, close your current contract and get a new one, sir.

C: ... You're in another country! See! That's why I hate speaking with people from other countries, you guys don't know what you're doing, you people only cause trouble!""

H: That's okay, sir. That makes two of us, good bye!

*Click*

H: Idiot...

After ending that call, I was under the impression that the customer would do the right thing and return the vehicle, maybe 1 or 2 days late and get a new contract. Little did I knew that he would take matters into his own hands. 

Idiotically, the customer decided to keep the vehicle despite the fact that he was contacted multiple times by the location. Not only has the vehicle been reported stolen (it appears they will dispatch a repo team soon), he has been placed in the Do Not Rent list and no doubt in my mind he'll have to pay a very handsome amount for his fuck up.

I found out he called today. Based on the notes from the Supervisor, he wasted no time blaming both me and the agent for providing him with false information (despite the fact that I told him it was not possible to extend the Reservation). He then told the Supervisor that he knew the manager at the location he rented from.

The Supervisor then called the rental location, and they were familiar with the situation. They told the Supervisor that they had tried to contact the customer multiple times, but he never picked up the phone.

The Supervisor told the customer that he needed to return the vehicle as soon as possible to any rental location. The customer told him that it wasn't possible. When the Supervisor asked why, the customer admitted that he wasn't even in the same state, he flew to New York, and during his stay he tested positive for Covid-19, so he had to quarantine himself two additional weeks. When the Supervisor suggested to contact Roadside Assistance to have the vehicle picked up, he said that the vehicle was locked inside his garage, so it wouldn't be possible for them to retrieve the vehicle.

The customer ended the call threatening the Supervisor that he would contact a higher department (possibly referring to corporate) and hung up.

“That’s not legal!” Yes it is,"Short and simple today my dudes. I work auto/motorcycle insurance.

Older gentleman calls inquiring on a refund he got. I explained to him that since he was paid out a bit further than the date he cancelled his policy it resulted in a refund! Yay! 

Caller: Why isn’t my refund more?

Me: Sir, I apologize but since the policy was cancelled early there was a cancellation penalty applied so the refund amount is correct. 

C: That’s not legal to do!!

M: Yes it is. Sir, it is stated in the contract you signed that there is a penalty for early cancellation.

I'm not a Karen,"This customer called me. A product that she was returning had not been scanned in by the delivery service we typically use. She had called them and then had called us, going back and forth. She just wanted to return the item and get her refund, determined to not look like a lying liar.

I thanked her for her dedication and told her that she didn't have to go through all of the effort. We always give the customer the benefit of the doubt here at SHOESRUS (obviously not my company's real name).  The customer states that it was the principle of the matter and that this delivery company often jerks her around. She called back a short while and I get her call again, which I am pleased about because honestly, this woman is hilarious. 

She tells me, ""I told them what time I came in to drop off my package, and everything that was on the label, because I always document everything. They still insisted I hadn't brought anything in and refused to look at the cameras until I told them I would be calling the police for theft.""

They finally listened to her and looked at the tapes, and what do you know? She DID drop off the item to return back to us!
 
I went through our normal procedure for this and the delivery company did an investigation, but the customer wanted to chat a bit more about it. Really wanted to express her hatred for this delivery service. She then said something that I hold very dearly to my heart.

""I am not a Karen. I am a Belinda with an attitude.""

Since then I have decided whenever someone is being a ""Karen"", but in the situation, they are actually 100% in the right, they are not a Karen. Just a Belinda with an attitude.",1119,0,0

Guy asks me what political party I support after I told him we won't tow his vehicle without plates,"I just needed to post this as a way to vent cause even though it happened yesterday, I'm still ticked at this guy.

So, I work in ERS as a dispatcher. There was a call on our hold garage (the garage we send calls to when it requires us to actually read the notes or when it's not ready to be sent to a garage yet) I was looking at the notes to see what was going on with it and saw that one of our garages was already out there and wouldn't tow it because it didn't have plates. It's against company policy to tow a vehicle without plates. If the tags expired within the last 60 days we'll allow it but anything past that we won't touch it.

Well after talking to the garage, I called the guy. He started off nice but that was just a front I guess. I was trying to explain why we wouldn't tow it but he wouldn't let me talk. He kept talking about how he just bought it and it broke down when he was driving it home, the old owner has a lien on it that he has to pay off before the member was able to get it in his name, per the governor, he had until December 1st to transfer plates from his good vehicle to this vehicle, he used to be a dispatcher for some company so he knows the law and just going on and on about all that I listed above. He kept telling me to go to some website because it said on there he had until December 1st. 

Just overall being rude by talking over me and not letting me explain anything. Because the thing is....it doesn't matter what the law was saying...this had to do with our policy's and not anything to do with the law. Which I tried explaining to him. 

Now something you should know about me is I rarely hang up on customers when they're being abusive. I think I've become desensitized to it and it doesn't bother me. Also, I try to avoid interrupting customers and let them say what it is that they want to say. This guy got so bad though and I knew it wasn't going anyways so I had no choice but to talk over him. He still wouldn't listen. I think this is when he realized that I wasn't going to go down without a fight so it devolved into craziness. 

He started asking me if I was a republican, or democratic, which I shut down right away and reminded him it had nothing to do with his call. He then went off on some tangent about how all the garages in that area are gun wielding white supremacist and a bunch of other bull that I wasn't really listening to. 

It turned into an argument between him and I because during all this he kept flip flopping and saying that the vehicle has good plates, the tags aren't expired and then would turn around and say it doesn't have plates. Finally, I realized that he meant his GOOD vehicle had good plates and he was going to take the plates from his good vehicle and put them on the bad vehicle and he felt he was allowed because the governor said he had until December 1st to get it transferred. Um no. Not how that works. Even if that was allowed, it's still against our policy. We won't touch a vehicle that we know has the plates for another vehicle. 

Now remember how I said that I can handle being cussed at and called names? Yeah well my kryptonite is when someone is condescending to me. That's a quick way to piss me off. 

Well after, he realized that I wasn't giving up he started talking to me like a child and started saying things like ""listen here little girl"" or ""now little girl...."" and that was my boiling point. I stopped being nice and told him flat out that he needs to stop calling me little girl and talk to me respectfully. If he can't, I'll hang up. 

Thankfully, this is when he asked for a manager and I'm sure if you listen to the recording you'd be able to here the glee in my voice when I told him I'd get one right away. I ended up transferring him and he pulled the same crap with my team lead and asking her where she lived and a bunch of other bull. 

He ended up calling back because she hung up on him and he placed another call and requested that we not send the same garage. Joke was on him though because we sent the same exact garage and he ended up having to wait a couple hours because they ended up taking long tows so he had to wait for a driver to be back in the area. 

And I'm assuming he ended up getting temp tags because they did end up towing him. But at least I got a small form of revenge in first.",127,0,0
Translation serves Aaaggghhh,"Ok I'm going to have a gripe,  a whine a cry baby tantrum about getting calls through translation services.     Now I don't know if this is the same in all call centers but whenever I get the prompt that the call is from a translation service I feel like hanging up and here's why.

Now this may just be the people my company uses but what they do I find extremely frustrating.

Firstly when answering a call we all give the company introduction and most customers by the large majority, even the brain dead Karens let us finish it.    No they talk through it.  

Secondly in a lot of cases the customer speaks very little English and the interpreter will speak half to them and half to me.   All the while I can hear both people and the customer will say somethings in English that seems to be to me and sometimes the interpreter will say things to the customer but then again it could be me.   Then it will be half English,  half the customers language.  Also to add a lot of the interpreters come from the country they are interpreting for;  no surprise there and thus often have very strong accents making it even harder to know if the interpreter is talking or the customer.   So is the customer speaking to me directly,  to the interpreter.     I have only had a few who do something remarkable which makes the call a lot easier.      Now I don't know if those people have a better system but they put me on hold so I don't hear the conversation b/w them and the customer and they put the customer on hold when relaying it back to me and getting the answer.    That way it's not a jumble of talking.",3,0,0

What was your WORST call in the recent past?,"Oh my, I could write a novel. But here's one that stands out. The other day I get a call (I take strictly offshore transfers from the phillipines by people who want to speak to an american agent, or they just transfer them to me mid sentence. You can imagine the anger I get daily), anyways this lady had a problem with her billing, anyways she didn't have the information to give to me to access her account. I said ""Ma'am, I'm sorry but the only options avaliable on my end at this point is to locate your account using your account number or phone number, you can either go online and maybe that will be easier for you to locate the issue or you can find a statement with your account number than call back at the same number so we can assist you, its all up to you on how we proceed ma'am."" She responds with ""You know the fuck what? You won't let me voice my opinions? I want to speak to another American representative, this call is terminated immediately from this point on."" While staying on the line. As it is policy that I cannot transfer a cx to another floor agent, only to another department or supervisor. I tell her ""Ma'am im very sorry but I cannot transfer you as it is against policy, you may call back at th"" She cuts me off, ""No this call is TERMINATED TRANSFER ME NOW YOU PIECE OF SHIT GIVE ME YOUR MANAGER YOU DIDNT LET ME SHARE MY OPINION"", I reply in my nicest and cheerful voice ever, talking over her yelling and said ""Okay Ma'am if there is nothing else I can assist you with, thank you for [redacted for company privacy] and you have a fantastic day!!"" *transfers to sup, call ends, unplug mic* Me: ""FUUUUUUUUUUUUCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK"".
Like what the hell, how did I prevent her from voicing her opinion, I was just asking for details to help her and explaining our billing process. Some people are just crazy.

They put me in the wrong queue on my first day.,"This actually happened today and I thought it was funny enough for this place.

So, a few weeks back I started a new WHM job at an IT call center. An important thing to note is that the client has 4 companies, but my site mostly provides service to 3 of them. The 4th is managed mostly by the client itself in Canada and the little support we provide is mostly by our tier 2 agents, a.k.a., the experts. The fourth company's name is SCI, by the way. This is important.

Anyway, today was the day when we'd finally take calls and it was hell. My calls were about troubleshooting software that I'd never heard of, helping with the migration to Office 365, and tracking down techs so I could give an update to the callers (all of which were managers and above). On top of that, the ticketing system we're supposed to use wasn't working for me because I couldn't find the users with the employee ID they'd give me.

After 4 hours I was about to give up. I was panicking because the calls were harder than I thought and I was way over my head. Whose bright idea was it to take this job when I'm not tech savvy? I was also worried because the training had been done remotely and maybe I'd missed something important. I felt like a total failure.

So, I was about to send an email to my supervisor letting them know how this wasn't for me and I was gonna quit when I received a message from one of the trainers.

Trainer: ""I was trying to find the ticket for that report on the rude technician but I couldn't find it. Do you have the employee ID?""

Me: ""Sure, it's SCI-xxxx.""

Trainer ""SCI? Like the company we don't actually service?""

Me: ""... the what?""

Trainer: ""Finish that call and get off the phone. Your credentials might be wrong so we have to fix them.""

It turns out that since I have a very common name they gave me the wrong skills and I was taking calls from the wrong queue for almost 5 hours. Eventually they fixed it and I went from almost crying to laughing at how ridiculous the whole thing was.

At least I learned I shouldn't ignore the company mission and values and history anymore.",27,0,0
My interest in Interest is 0,"Not sure why this is difficult to understand. But there I go, assuming that people understand the terms and conditions, at the very least the disclosure that they get when the card is opened.

Stop being a whiny baby, suck it up, be an adult, accept the consequences of your actions, and stop calling me to get your interest waived!!!!”

Lady doesn’t understand how our device payment plan process works,"So I work for a small-ish wireless company that’s only in a certain area of the country. When it comes to the customer base..... they aren’t the brightest. And the store reps do NOT help matters either, they give out the wrong info all the time and I have to do everything to correct it constantly. 

Had a lady call in, stating she had been charged three times for her watch DPP. I look at her bill, and I immediately know she’s confused. She had payment 23 of 24, and 1 of 24. Check the history for the line, see she got a new watch about a week before her billing cycle ended. Explained to her that, no she wasn’t charged twice. One was for her old watch. The other for her new watch. She insists that she was, and that she had paid off her watch in store. I tried explaining to her that the way we do DPPs is simple: start of the billing cycle, the DPP is automatically added to the bill. So in the systems eyes, that payment is done. So if payment 23 is auto added, and you go in and pay 24, then it is paid off, but because of how it works, it’ll show up on the bill for that cycle. I also tried explaining that regardless of when you get a new device. It will appear on the bill for that cycle. 

Apparently I was “wrong” because she insists that it’s not supposed to show up until the next bill. Then she goes off about making sure she got her promos applied to her new phone dpp, because she insisted she got charged full price. Check the promo, reassure that it’s there. And that it doesn’t kick in all at once, rather it applies every month to reduce the dpp payment. She didn’t make a fuss about seeing the dpp for her phone on the bill though (amazing what they pick and choose to whine about). But she kept insisting that I hand her over to a supervisor because she shouldn’t have been charged 3 times. Was more than happy to do so, and last I saw, the supervisor had a hard time trying to explain the process to her.",121,0,0

Why is my total bigger than what I paid? I used a gift card?,"The title pretty much sums it up. I get the notification, a chat came in. I start with the “Thank you for contacting ***! How can I help you?” 

“Yes, I just got my order confirmation, and the total on the email is way different than what the pay screen said. I used two coupons and a gift card.” 

“Oh no! I’m no sorry. Can I get the information so I can look into it?” I look it up and see that the total was like $35. I looked at the items she bought and got the coupon promo codes she used and got to investigating. After putting everything in, I got the same total. $35. “I’m sorry ma’am, it seems one of the codes you used isn’t valid for this item, so I’m not sure why you might’ve seen that. How much did you end up paying?” 

“Well the screen after I put the gift card in said $5, so why is my total $35?” 

This is when I put the dots together. 

“Wait...is the charge on your card $35? Or just the order confirmation email?” 

“The email.” 

“Well then, that would be normal, because the total of the order after everything was $35.”

Don't abuse people who have control over your essential services,"So this didn't happen to me so I'm a bit scant on details but I thought this was too good for me to not post it here

So I work for a big telecom in the UK in their cancellations team. Surprisingly, the vast majority of people we speak to are actually pretty reasonable or at the very least non abusive.

Not this guy though, so the guy in my team gets a call, and for one reason or another, some angry Scottish guy is giving him pure abuse for literally no reason. Shouting, swearing, the works. He does what is asked of him instantly and still the customer is totally unreasonable and continues hurling abuse at him.

Anyway they eventually finish the call after 15 minutes of this, but my teammate lets our manager know about what happened. Our manager takes his details (number/name), and proceeds to disconnect *all three* remaining lines on his account.

So because this guy was an asshole, he's now lost his numbers forever and has no phone functionality until he's able to sort out sim cards from another provider. Oh yeah, and he has to wait 2 weeks to unlock his phones. Moral of the story? Don't abuse people for no reason when they control over your essential services.

Money does not work that way,"So, a part of the job of internet tech support was:

Guy acts like a dick and had to pay double of what he could have paid,"So this happened awhile ago but I just stopped another guy from doing the same thing so was thinking about it. (Thankfully this member was a lot easier than the previous guy) It's not as interesting, I feel, as some of my other stories but is a good example as to why you shouldn't be a dick to people. 

So if you haven't seen one of my other posts, I work in emergency roadside assistance (ERS) as a dispatcher. I work for a well known company where you can purchase a membership. We have 3 different levels but no matter which level you purchase, the rules for what is and isn't covered are the same. 

One of the things we don't cover is something we call a piggy back tow. A piggy back tow is when a member calls in and places a call going a certain distance that's within their covered limit (max is 100 unless you have top and then you get 1 200mile tow) and then when that tow is finished they place another call going farther. They do this so they don't have to pay any over mile fees. This is not covered though. You get one tow per breakdown and if you need to go over your covered amount of miles, you have to pay for every mile over. 

Well about a year ago now this guy had a call placed. What we didn't realize was that the tow destination was for a convenience store. This is the first red flag because why would you tow to a convenience store???

So the garage goes out and tows the vehicle to where the member has to go. It about 50 miles I believe. 

Some time goes by, we forget about the call and I'm updating members. I open a call and for some reason decided to look and see if there was anything in the notes and this is when I see that the member was requesting a specific garage and that that garage was already OL.

Problem was that this garage was 50 miles away from this member so it didn't make sense why they were requesting them or why that garage was even in the area. So I looked up his call history and this is when I see he had a previous call. 

The original was going 50 miles and the new call was going about 100 miles. The guy was only covered for 100 though. So I put 2 and 2 together and realized he was piggy backing. 

So before calling him I called the garage and let them know that this guy isn't covered for another tow and they're gonna have to charge him. They say okay they'll let that driver know and hang up. It's a good thing I called them first. 

So I call the member to explain that he can't piggy back and he'll have to pay for the 2nd tow. Whelp. I barley had a chance to even utter the words ""not covered"" before he went OFF. He wasn't yelling or anything but from the way he was talking, he was an ass. 

His whole thing was because the person that took his call put the call through, we had to honor it and that the driver was already towing it and we can't back out now and just being really condescending/rude. If you've ever had to deal with someone who wasn't yelling/being asshole but just wouldn't let you talk, talking to you like you're an idiot then you know what I was dealing with. 

He had me so mad just with the way he was talking that my blood pressure shot up and my arms were shaking and it takes a lot to get me like that. 

But I digress. 

I was trying to explain to him that it doesn't matter if the person that took his call didn't say anything, they were from another club and therefore couldn't' see that he had placed a call earlier today or I'm sure they would have told him no and even if they did see and didn't say anything, just because you got past them doesn't mean we have to just honor it. 

He would not stop repeating that over and over. He seriously thought that because he was able to place the 2nd call without anyone saying to him it wasn't covered, that he ""won"" and that we were required to honor the tow and cover it anyways and that the garage was already towing it. 

This is why I'm glad I called the garage first. I told him that I already spoke with the garage and explained it wasn't covered and they'll be calling him shortly to arrange payment. He didn't care though and eventually, I had to transfer him to a supervisor who told him the same thing and wouldn't budge on it. 

The thing is though he ended up screwing himself by being a dick. Because while we couldn't just allow the second tow, we could have saved him some money.

If the driver gets to the tow destination and the member changes their mind and wants to go somewhere else and they haven't dropped the vehicle yet, the driver can take them to the new address and they won't get charged for a second call because it hadn't been dropped yet so is tech considered the same tow. 

If he had been nice we could have just pretended that the driver hadn't dropped the vehicle yet and had the driver continue the tow to the new destination and the member would have only had to pay for the miles going over the 100 miles. But because he was a dick I wasn't about to tell him that loophole. So he was towed and covered for 50 miles and ended up having to pay the driver a hook up fee and pay for 100 miles. If he had been nice though he could have been covered for his full 100 miles and only had to pay for 50 miles. 

&amp;#x200B;

So moral of the story? Don't be a dick.

P.S. If this is confusing, I'm sorry. I was trying to explain it in a way that made sense.",22,0,0

If you’re going to lie....,"I love my job and I love with the people I work with but it sure has made me cynical of people. Before I started I was very trusting... 11 years later not so much. Here’s one such story that chipped away at my belief that people are trustworthy.

Quick information, we have a very flexible cancellation policy, but if you don’t show up the day youre booked and haven’t tried to make contact with us before, you have lost your money. But we are allowed to use our discretion.

M - me
C - customer

M- good morning, me speaking how can I help

C- (sounding a bit off but it’s Monday morning) hi, I was supposed to start this morning but my partner passed away over the weekend

M - (note I am a very awkward person) Oh I am so sorry to hear that. Can I have your name and date of birth and I will look up booking. Ok so we offer your booking every week, due to the circumstances we can certainly move this free of charge for you. Would you like to rebook now or call us back and I can make a note.

C- can I rebook for next Monday

M- (thinking, bit soon but everybody deals with grief in different ways) ok sir, that’s you rebooked and the new information sent over.

Now this doesn’t sound like much of a story until the following Monday comes round and one of my colleagues gets a call FROM HIS PARTNER to say he was ill and couldn’t attend. Unfortunately I hadn’t noted about the death on his comments and so he got a further free of charge rebooking.

"Racist women demands credit and when refused, she plays the Sax","A little of backstory, so I work in a escalations team in a ISP from the US but we are located in Mexico, basically we took calls that require a supervisor, my job is try to descalate the call and try to make deals with the customers or educate them in the best way possible why we  cant fullfil some of their requests.
Usually this escalations are through chat, so the agent will contact us in that way and explain the situation, we try to give some advice to the agents to try to descalate the situation without the transfer.
Today I had an agent on the chat telling that a customer was demanding a 1 year credit of services because she had and outage of 1 hour and spoke previosly with another agent that told her this info, but the service never came back, so we did the usual and scheduled a tech appointment for next day as it was already late and no techs were availabale, but she insisted and wanted to talk with a supervisor, so I took the call becaus I knew this was about to get fun. I know this was not one of my best jobs but if pwople want respect, the need ro respect you first.

M: Hi, my name is OP and Im the supe...
C: ARE YOU THE SUPERVISOR IN CHARGE??? I NEED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT YOUR AGENTS AND HOW THEY LIED TO ME, I NEED A FULL CREDIT OF THE SERVICE ON THIS YEAR
(Yes, she was yelling the whole time)
M: Im sorry to hear about it, as I had understood from my agent, theres was an outage but the services never cameback, correct? And we already have a tech appointment as soon as possible for you
C: THAT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME, I NEED MY SERVICES NOW AND A FULL CREDIT OF THIS YEAR BECAUSE THE FIRST AGENT TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD COME BACK ON ABOUT AN HOUR AGO BUT NOTHING HAPPENED
M: Again C, we are really sorry about it, I cant offer you a 1 year credit but I can offer you 25 dlr credit for the inconvenience of today and will be reflected on your next bill.

She keeps insisting about the credit and I denied in the most polite way and offered continusly my deal wirh some extra perks and then she dropped the bomb.

C: ARE YOU MEXICAN? BECAUSE I CAN HEAR YOUR ACCENT
M: Yes M'm, Im indeed.
C: OH SO YOU ARE A RACIST, MISOGINIST AND SEXIST THAT DOESNT KNOW HOW TO TREAT WOMEN EDUCATED LIKE ME
At this point, I was losing my patience
M: Im sorry, im doing my best possible right now for you
C: SO, HELP ME OUT OR SEND ME TO CORPORATE BECAUSE YOU BEANERS DONT KNOW HOW RO TREAT A LADY AND YOU ONLY SEE THE WOMEN AS A OBJECT TO REPRODUCE YOURSELFS
M: Im really sorry, but are you listening to yourself, you are being the racist and If we dont keep this professional, I will need to release this call.
C: HOW DARE YOU TO TALK TO ME LIKE THAT, I WILL GET YOU FIRED, YOU ARE NOT RELEASING THE CALL, TRANSFER ME TO CORPORATE
M: Im sorry but I cant, I dont have the option foe, if you want to talk with an American you can release the call and try your luck.
C: I KNOW YOU CAN AND I WILL WAIT FOR YOU TO DO IT.
M: Do as you please

At this moment I was allowed to release the call, but for the lolz I stayed on the line and I didnt regret it. It was silent for about 10 minutes, she ocasionally asking if I was there and if I would transfer her with the same response, then she said:
C: Okay so if you are not going to transfee me, I will make noise.
So she LITERALLY starts to play the saxophone in the most awful way possible, but I muted myself and started to laugh my ass off, and she went like that for about 5 minutes only to stop to say""LOOK HOW EDUCATED IM, YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO BE AS EDUCATED AS ME YOU BEANER"", I just couldnt stop laughing, until she realized that I wouldnt transfer her and she dropped the call.
She made my day.

It’s a check.,"First time writing in here and I will make it short. I work in the financial industry and take calls for a number of functions, today I had my worst caller in a while so I figured I’d share [people avoid giving you a hard time when you are in control of the conversation.]

So, I answer
“Hi my name is ___ can I have your first and last name please?]
After his answer I say, in my usual way as I try to keep my calls uniform “and what can we help you with today?”
We is used as I all the time where I live, it’s just how WE talk. Not really uncommon elsewhere anyways.
So the customer’s response is:
“We are not discussing anything, you and I are talking about information I need.”
Immediately I’m thrown off because of all the things to be set off over a noun which is technically being used correctly should not be one of them.
So I move the call forward and the customer is constantly railing me with backhanded insults or this or that, but I refuse to let someone stop me from winning when I am the one in control so I persist. I move the call along until he eventually asks me what kind of check he needs to make a large purchase. For those who may not know there is only one kind of check. Entity to entity. The same kind of check you would see if you wrote one to a friend or family. So I explain this to him and he continues to give me grief until eventually he asks what other payment options he could use, I inform him of a few methods including a money order OR a cashier’s check [cashiers checks are not generally considered to be checks as they are counted as cash.] Now hearing the word check after being told there is only one kind of check unleashes his inner Karen and he proceeds to borate me for several minutes [tanking my handle time btw seeing as it is a Saturday so things are slow.] and eventually asking me to have a manager call him. I inform him I can open a complaint case and escalate it to our management team in an attempt to rectify whatever the issue may be, I would simply need his phone number. At this point the customer continues to berate me and eventually hangs up without giving me contact information, so I file his complaint as anonymous and notice an email from my team lead, who apparently was listening in on my call. No subject, just in the message box: “It’s a check...” 

Maybe not the most interesting call but I thought I would share my minor victory as that email turned a terrible moment into a fulfilling one.",65,0,0

"Surprise, doctors need to get paid too.","Background: I work for a company that bills for physicians because everyone's a contractor these days. Most ER's split the bills so we handle the physician's side of things. 

I literally had a patient go: ""so you're telling me, when I go to the emergency room, I have to pay for a DOCTOR?"" 

""Yessir. A doctor treated you. He's employed by us. In order for him to get paid, we need you to pay his bill.""

""BUT I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. I DONT HAVE TO PAY FOR A DOCTOR.""

""Incorrect.""

This continued to go on and on. I continually told him that the doctor needs to get paid somehow and even though he may have only met him for a second, he's still doing work behind the scenes. Every time he asked why the bill wasn't included in the hospital bill, I'd dumb it down more and more. 

""Sir, the doctor?""

""Yes?""

""The doctor, you see, he doesn't work for the hospital.""

""Okay.""

""So he gets paid by us. This is why you're receiving a bill."" 

""NO YOURE NOT UNDERSTANDING ME. Why isn't it included with the hospital bill?""

Doctor no work for emergency room, doctor work for us, hospital no pay doctor, we pay. 

Fun times, y'all.

I didn't really expect to be opening this sort of dialogue, but I'm here for it. I was more ""hahaha man doesn't think he sees doctor in ER"", but I definitely agree that the healthcare system is fucked up.

Woman tried to sue us for her awful driving meaning she drove into a lamppost,"So I used to work in the call centre for my local council. So would take calls about school places, roads, grass that hasn't been cut.... things like that. Occasionally we would get people try to put in insurance claims against the council for things like tripping over uneven paving slabs, burst tyres due to potholes etc.

We once had a crazy lady call and say she had just reversed into one of the streetlights on a public road. So I said okay no worries if you can let me know whereabouts the light is I can put a report through to ask an engineer to go and have a look at the damage and assess if it needs repairing and I thanked her for letting us know. Assumed that would be it, she then proceeded to say ""I didn't call to report the damage to the streetlight, I called about the damage to my car"". I asked her what exactly she was requesting from us as at this point I was a bit confused. She literally said she would like me to send out information to her in the post about how she can put in a claim against us for the damage to her car because it was apparently our fault for putting the streetlight there, and threatened legal action due to our ""negligence""...

Throughout this whole conversation she failed to accept that there was no possible way the LA would accept liability for damage to her car because she drove into a lamppost, as there is no possible way the council were responsible for the damage purely because we ""put the streetlight there in the first place"" as she claimed....

I don't really remember what happened after, I think I transferred her to a supervisor as she refused to take no for an answer. Probably one of most WTF phone calls I took in my short time working at a call centre, every now and then I wonder how far she got with that claim in the end...

NO, you owe it to your bank and if you don’t pay it does not hurt us. 

Me: Hello, thank you for calling ... may I have your Client ID number? ... Thank you, how can I help you?

Customer: Hello, I was calling about my payments. 

Me: Yes, I see your account is past due. If you miss any more payments your creditors may drop off of the program and you would have to pay at full payments and high interest rate. 

Customer: I know, I’m struggling making the payments. I have so much to pay for and I don’t want my creditors to drop off. Is there any way the payments can be lower? 

Me: I’m sorry to hear that. Well it would be up for the creditors to lower it. They already lowered the payments and interest rate when accepting the proposal. What changed in your budget? 

Customer: My rent is higher and my husband is only working seasonal. 

I felt bad because the customer was really nice and they seemed sad like they really needed help.

Me: Let me place you on hold and see if there’s anything that can be done. *Placed on hold*

What is Wrong with you?,"Reading something about the cable company I used to work for reminded me of this. It was a pretty big news item at the time, but I can't find anything about it anymore, so I don't know who knows the story nowadays, so here we go.

Our call center had an agent, sat about 20 feet from me (internet tech support) back in... oh about 2005, give or take a year, who had a big damned argument with a customer. I don't know if I ever knew the details of that argument, and just forgot or not, but that part isn't relevant besides that the agent was really pissed at the customer.  Which doesn't in the least make it justified, but he went into our email support tools and decided to change their email address to a really obscene thing to do with children that I'm absolutely not going to type out here.  (WHY DID THE AGENTS EVEN HAVE THAT BUTTON)

Customer shortly found out his email wasn't working, because whatever client he was using obviously couldn't find his old email address to connect to on the server. So he called back in to find out.  Standard troubleshooting for email very early on starts with:

*""So what address are you having trouble with""*

""(insert email address here""

*""Um... that's not what we have on file for you. We have...well (insert obscene email address here)""*

""(ABSOLUTE JUSTIFIED CUSTOMER EXPLOSION)""

So, fallout (at call center floor level, I don't know precisely what happened at upper management level, just rumors but they were NOT GOOD) was his immediate dismissal, hours and hours of meetings for the agents about how insane this was and how you don't do things like this, and a personal doubling of my workload for literal years, as basically every button in existence that could potentially do anything like this in any way was taken away for everyone at Tier 1 level, at all our call center locations.  I was the head of Tier 1.5 at my center, and even the newer half of my colleagues lost their access, so I was on a very short list of people trusted to have all the buttons, and spent a good half of my time from there on the other end of an instant messenger program handling simple email troubleshooting steps for agents because one person couldn't be trusted to not do something insane.",22,0,0
The Crazy Just Keeps Getting Crazier,"I work in an insurance call center handling complex technical calls and taking escalated calls. Most of my calls are ho-hum technical calls. I handle escalations about billing and underwriting, which are usually a variation of ""how dare you tell me that you won't insure me for free."" The call I'm about to describe is one of my personal favorite deviations from the norm in recent memory.

Your intrepid writer logs into her phone. Two minutes into her shift comes her very first call. An escalation from a relatively new vendor rep complaining that she's been on the phone with this guy for an hour. It took him an hour to get to the point of asking to hear my lovely voice. Sure, send him on over.

The customer, it turns out, is wondering whether insurance follows the vehicle or the driver. I explain that the answer is technically both, depending on which coverage and the situation. It stems from the fact that his insurance agent excluded his wife from coverage. He is not happy with nuance and wants a one-or-the-other answer. He then goes on to provide a very specific example:

""So, if Jeff Bezos drives my car....""

So many questions. One, how are we getting to use Jeff Bezos as an example for this? Two, why on earth would Jeff Bezos want to drive your 1996 Toyota Tercel? Three, do you really think this is ever going to be an actual situation you'll encounter? Four, you know that Jeff Bezos does not live anywhere near you, sir, right? Five, did you listen to the first part of the question you're asking me?

It only gets more ridiculous. He then wants to know about letting someone drive his vehicle. I explain the concept of *permissive* use. (For those of you who don't know, permissive use means lending your vehicle to someone who is not listed on your policy. How insurers treat it may vary depending on your insurer, your state, and various other minutiae.)

""So, there's coverage following the vehicle. This means that I need an exclusion form for every person on the planet, right? Do I need to exclude Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerburg?""

My response: ""Sir, as long as you're not allowing every person on earth to drive your Toyota Tercel, you should be fine. It's far easier to tell Jeff, Mark, Bill and Elon no when they ask to drive that Tercel than it is for us to send you approximately seven billion copies of an exclusion form.""

I asked her to hold while I reviewed her account to see what we could do.  I decided to use the mute button since I knew the hold would be verify short.  I had one button to push to give her the credit when all of the sudden I here her say to someone in the background:  ""I have another N-word on the phone.""  

I paused.  Took her off mute and told her ""Ma'am, I heard that.  You can call back.""  

While she was trying to come up with an apology I hung up on her.  That was the first and only time I have ever hung up on a customer.  I made sure to detail her account about what she said to make it harder to get a credit from the next person.  

Moral of the story:  If you don't hear hold music you are not on a true hold.  Watch your mouth.  Also, customers need to take into considerations that the person you are talking to may have your SSN, DON, Address, and your job information.   And they might be a little crazy.",1647,0,0

Work From Home Burnout?,"When work from home first started, I was stoked. I had been with the company I work for for a few years and mid- March of this year, our office became 100% remote. I had been working from home, one day a week previously, to provide me a bit of flexibility.  Now with working remote 100% of the time, it gave me so many benefits!

\-No commuting

\-PJ's all day if I wanted (currently do this only  once a week)

\-Getting stuff done around the house.

\-Take a nap if I need/want on my break/lunch

\-Working out/walking the dog on my breaks

Now we are in November, and while I don't dread working from home, I feel that there would be an inevitable burnout at some point. At the end of the day, I close the door to my office and it is as if the room doesn't exist until the next work day. I do miss seeing my co-workers and only so much can be done via Teams chat and all as far as team building. 

Now if I was given the choice to remain WFH or return to the office, I would choose WFH 100%. At this point it is looking like it will stay this way (at least for my team), but if 2020 has taught us anything, it is that things can change in an instant).

Call handling process for rude/racist callers,"I just need to get this off my chest.  

Years ago, I worked in a company that handled outsourced call centre jobs from the US, and I was assigned to in a US Telco account. Thing is, once the customer hears my accent (I am not an American), some take it as their cue to be racist and/or rude. One particular caller said to me, “Are you from the United States? I don’t want to talk to stupid monkeys, I want to speak to an American.”  

The thing about this telco company is that they wouldn’t allow the agents to hang up on those abusive callers, and I even remember one new agent bursting into tears when she was forced to continue with the call with such a customer. She quit shortly after that incident.  

I worked in that account for a bit over two years until I resigned and found another post in another call centre, this time one handling multinational customers. This company has such process that allowed us to give three warnings if the caller becomes abusive/nasty/racist, and if the said caller did it several times, the managers have the power to block that number off the system. Needless to say, I loved that job more, and performed well until I got promoted to a higher post.  

I am just curious, why would some companies allow abusive callers to say whatever they want and these said companies would rather protect those callers than the people who work for them? That put me off telco call centres so much that after moving to another country, when that was all the customer service job that I could get, I decided to do an entirely different job.",29,0,0

It's your own time you're wasting!,"First time Post, on mobile, so apologies for formatting, etc. 

This happened about 20 years ago,when I worked in a UK call centre for an international rail service, booking tickets for journeys between 3 different European cities. It was also around the time that budget airlines really took off (pun intended).
I had a customer (f) call me up to enquire the price of a day return ticket from City A to City B. After confirming her preferred date of travel I was able to offer a price of £69.00 total. She responded by saying that she can get a flight for 50 pence each way. My first thought was ""Well why the @#$! are you phoning me?"". I went through the usual routine of asking whether that included airport taxes, transfers, etc, also taking the time to remind her that we operated to and from the city centre, whilst the airline would probably fly to a minor  out of the way airport that nobody has ever heard of. No, she was adamant her trip would cost her £1, if she flew, and what could I do about our price? Well, our prices were set in stone - we had no discretion whatsoever, which I told her. After a few more minutes of back and forth I had to tell her that if price was her main criteria for picking a mode of transport that she should book the flights, but please call me back if I could be of any further help. We had a bit of a laugh at it when I told my colleagues afterwards, and I always remember that call as an amusing way of wasting 20 minutes.",31,0,0

Deal with micromanaging or angry customer service calls?,"So I started working at this call center for health insurance. I’ve worked sales before in gyms and even had to deal with call leads. I initially applied to verifcation specialist but they moved me to Customer Service since the VS department is mostly women... anyway, the first few days, the guy whose suppose to train me and this other dude isnt doing his job so the head boss has our main supervisor teach us the works in about 1 day with rest of week ready for us. Easy stuff in the end, just gotta call or pick up phone for payment declines, explain benefits, angry calls and save cancellations if possible. We were getting a good hang of it.

Then on Monday, not everyone went to work due to heavy flooding from a storm. The head boss was the first in the office and I was the second. Suddenly he moves me outside to do Front calling. He tells me to follow the script, translate in spanish if needed, and to ask questions if needed as well. Also to shadow the best sales agent (Bruce) whose been there two months and started off like myself. I had about 8 calls, 3 leads, and 1 sale for my first day. Bruce gave me tips, was patient and kind throughout the day. The head boss gave me tips on what to say as well on a few leads but only one of those got closed while others were broke. Him and the two other agents there were satisfied with how I did for my first time doing Front and asked me if I wanted to stay. I said “yes”.

Next day, Tuesday. Everyone is in the office. I get my assigned seat, get immediately to work. I almost made a sale within first 30 min but computer glitched out and the client didnt pick up phone after. The computers then had connection issues throughout day so I had to refresh the page constantly. The sales office manager, my new supervisor, sat me next to Bruce so I can be under his wing. Again, gave me tips and was patient with questions. Now this is where things got a bit pressuring....

The call monitor was here today so he was on top of my calls 24/7. Even interrupting some calls I was in the middle of to correct me on something or to say properly something to the client. And to heavily follow the script and no stray off it. Avoid saying “like” “um” “i mean”. He said I was doing good since I have high energy while talking but to slow down script and that he is only trying to help me out. He got on top of me about 15 times today. Mind you, for things that not even Bruce, office manager or the head boss complained about when they were listening to my calls.  It got to the point where the later half of the day I just lost confidence and was super careful on certain calls. Even skipped a few where I knew he would say something about. 

Later during lunch break, I walk past him and the front desk rep talking about my performance and how I don’t listen and not filling out the Front forms right. I only missed 3 details on the form which suprisingly Bruce or the head boss never corrected me on. I even overheard the office manager getting a bit aggravated. Day ends, head boss has meetting with us about a fresh sales agent who nearly lost a sale since the client didnt believe she was an agent but an operator. My old supervisor had to save it

My old supervisor asked my new one how I did. He said I had 5 leads and made 2 sales. And that I did better than the other front person who had no successful call the entire day. Old Supe then said that doing Front is good easy money and good start to being a licensed agent.

Lately, I’ve been thinking it over. I plan on going back to school for my Bachelors in January 2021. So I won’t be staying long since its full time, they don’t know that yet. I mainly got it to help the bills in the mean time. Thats the thing, I don’t know if in the mean time I should stick with Front or CS. I was planning on talking to old supe tomorrow about the situation.

I can wait out till end of week to make final decision but if the call monitor gonna continue micro managing like this, I understand its his job but if he has to complain behind my back and hinder my performance like this after only 2 days of being suddenly switched departments, it may not be the right position for me and I would rather have my bearings in CS. Even the other dude working CS changed his mind about working the floor after dealing with similar treatment. And he was only put there for 2 hours just to see how it feels working there.

Is this the right decision?

"""I ALREADY DID THAT!""","Why the hell do people bother calling tech support if they feel that just because they googled around a little and tried out 2-3 standard troubleshooting steps on their own (restarting, checking WiFi settings, etc), that they're exempt from doing *any* of the troubleshooting steps with me on the phone, which I've been trained for in order to fix their problem, which I've fixed in countless other devices? 

It makes no damn sense. Like yes, I understand, Karen, that you turned it off and on again, and might have done a few other things you read online, but if you're so doubtful about my ability and knowledge of your device and how to fix the problem you're having, then why the fuck are you even bothering to call tech support in the first place? To just grump at someone for 40+ minutes on the phone, call yourself smart when you couldn't figure out how to fix your own problem, and then NOT get your problem fixed? The hell does that solve?

"""If you were in front of me, I'd throw my phone right in your face!""","tl;dr customer thought the base rate was the total due of the reservation, demands that I issue a full refund and waive the cancellation fees while being a complete ass... yeah, no.

I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

This customer is going to travel to EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport) tomorrow, and paid in advance for his rental. Problem is that when he called to give us his frequent flyer number, he realized (much to his horror) that the price of his rental increased. Like many of the customers I have to deal with, it was my company's fault that he was so distracted that he couldn't see the taxes and fees on the website (which appear two times before requesting your credit card information).

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C: Customer

H: Thank you for calling Rental Car Company, my name is HenriquesDumbCousin and I'm a supervisor for reservations, may I have your name?

C: Customer.

H: Thank you very much, how can I assist you?

C: I'm calling to cancel the reservation I just did and **you will issue me a full refund.**

I don't know if I've mentioned this in the past, but I hate when the customer tries to tell me how to do my job. Whatever, let's see what's going on.

H: Do you have your confirmation number?

The customer gives me the confirmation number, clearly frustrated because he gave it to the previous agent and it was a cold transfer, so I didn't know what was going on.

C: Your agent told me that he couldn't honor the rate I was promised, so you'll cancel this and issue a full refund.

H: What was the original...?

C: Excuse me! I was promised a rate on the website, after that I called to attach my frequent flyer number to earn some miles, and I was informed that you wouldn't honor the what's on the website, so I want you to cancel the reservation.

H: *Charming*... What was the original rate?

C: 283 USD

I see the reservation, and indeed, **the base rate was 283 USD**, but with taxes and fees included, the rate increased to 440 USD.

H: That's just the base rate, without any taxes and fees.

C: No, that's the price of the reservation, and since you're unwilling to honor that rate, I want all my money back right now.

H: I can cancel the reservation, but if I do that, there will be a cancellation fee.

C: So not only you refuse to honor the price I was promised, you're telling me that you're going to, excuse my french, fuck me over?

Okay... I shouldn't have the said the following...

H: That's not French...

C: Excuse me!

H: Ce n'est pas français...

This guy continues to demand that we honor the **REAL** price or that I issue a full refund for his reservation.

C: I'm asking you to take control of the situation and do the right thing.

H: I'm taking control of the situation, sir. If I cancel the reservation, there will be a Cancellation Fee.

C: Who do you work for? For the customer or for the company?

H: ... I work for the company, sir. I have to follow their policies.

C: So you don't care that you're company is screwing with good people, loyal customers. You have no honor! You're dishonorable, you have no honor!

While this dumbass was calling me names, I was verifying if other locations would have less expensive vehicles available, their schedules, stuff that may help this guy.

H: Maybe if you pick up the car...

C: Excuse me!

H: No, sir...

C: Excuse me, as I was telling you...

H: No, sir, I'm done with you interrupting me, now you're going to listen to me. I'm looking at other locations in the area, for example, downtown, we may be able to lower the rate if you go there.

C: And how am I going there? Is there a shuttle? Are you going to pay for my taxi?

H: No, sir.

C: Man, why do you guys insist in screwing me up.

Continues to say that the website only showed the 283 USD

H: I'm on the website right now, I'm making a dummy reservation and it clearly shows me the taxes and fees, sir.

C: You know what, what's your e-mail? I'm going to send you a screenshot!

H: Rental Car Company @...

C: NO! WHAT'S YOUR E-MAIL?

H: I'm not going to share that information with you, sir.

More bickering, it's been almost ten minutes, and this guy comes with this **brilliant** solution.

C: Let's do the following HenriquesDumbCousin, cancel my reservation and issue a full refund, then you can make me another reservation for 283 USD, how about that?

H: ... that's not how things work, sir.

C: You listen to me, if you were in front of me, I'd throw my phone right in your face!

H: Uh-huh... I do apologize sir, but I don't answer to threats, have a nice evening.

He would constantly repeat throughout the call that he was a loyal customer over and over, so I got curious and looked for previous rentals under his name, and unsurprisingly, there wasn't a single reservation under his name in the past 12 months.

I did find out, though, that before he talked to me, he had already called and talked with another unfortunate soul. Based on the notes of the previous agent he spoke with, he started yelling at the agent right away. 

That poor agent closed his notes with, and I quote:

*Customer called me c@ck@@ suck@@r mf and hung up.*

Yeah, *charming fella...*

**FAQ**

**I don't understand, what's with this ""Cancellation Fee""?**

You have the option to pay at the counter or pay in advance. Normally, if you pay in advance, you can save a decent amount of money.

Please be aware that if you pay in advance and choose to cancel the reservation at any point (one minute after creating it, one month before the pick up, it doesn't matter) there's going to be a cancellation fee. 

Many people tell me that it doesn't say that in the website, and I always tell them the same: It's right above the check box you clicked before paying, the once that says ""I have read the terms and conditions"". It's a rather big box, clearly visible.",331,0,0
"I'm an accountant, hence I'm right.","Oh phone, formatting, blah blah.

Spoke to a gentleman today who threw down the ultimate card - he works in a field relating to his query.

He came on, admitting he was already annoyed by our automated line not understanding his post code. Now this part, I sympathise with. Accents over here are pretty varied and automatic lines can struggle to understand but that won't lessen the frustration of dealing with them.

I assured him I could take payment over the phone which mollified him. Got through all the basics of security and opening up the payment system but he became incensed when I asked him to type in his card information.

To increase the security of taking payments with agents, our payment system was updated in late 2018. Instead of providing card number and digits from the back and us blanking out the call recording for that section, details are now typed into your phone the middle section of your card and the digits on the back are starred out.

This was to make things more secure for customers and prevent the possibility of details being used by the agent online. Hadn't happened in our company but trying to be security aware.

This man is affronted that I won't type the details in. Explaining I literally can't as it's not designed to work that way does not appease him. He does not believe this is more secure and we are making it impossible to pay his bill. Advised of online and ability to pay in shop, which be ignores and continues to say how inexcusable this is, querying what we would do for customers with the very old style phones with ring, still not liking the other options available, including D/D.

Want's to speak to a manager. I advised I can put him through but they still will not be able to amend to take the payment. States still wants to speak to senior as he is an accountant and knows what is acceptable.

The throwing around of jobs is such a peeve of mine. I truly wanted to ask how it was relevant or call out his bs but I did transfer him to a senior. From her notes he didn't believe her either and threatened to switch.

If anyone is an accountant, would this type of payment system be a concern to you. Or what does everyone think, talking bs because he's already annoyed 

He just struck me as petty since we have so many payment options but this one not being to his taste was a crime... despite having made payment the same way with a colleague in June.",378,0,0

You need to go to therapy,"When I was 17 I worked 10pm to 6am at a place that took calls for infomercials. I was also one of the people who took over calls when someone asked for a supervisor. Since we all we did was take the orders we didn’t have access to them after sending the orders. 

One day this older man(sounded around 60) placed an order for girls gone wild. He got charged and waited to get his product that never came. Since he didn’t have any information about the company he called us when he didn’t get his product.

Him: I already have the number and have tried to call them multiple times with no answer.

Me: I’m sorry to hear that but once we place the order we can’t access any of the information because all we do here is place the orders. If you would like I can give you their customer service address. 

Him: you need to do something because you guys are the ones that took the order.

Me: again, sir, we do not have access to customer information after it is sent. This is to protect the customer’s information. You need to get ahold of the company itself either by calling or by mail.

@ customers: please don't blame us for everything,"This should be common sense and definitely is on this subreddit, but I get to talk to so many ridiculous people daily that I really need to vent about some stuff, I hope you guys don't mind.

Don't assume we have authority over how the processes work. We aren't supervisors or managers, and we risk our quality scores and possibly jobs if we don't follow the procedure. So we aren't refusing to refund you more than $X for your cold food because we hate you and want to rob you, it's because that's the goddamn policy and the system doesn't give us any option above that. 

Don't try to abuse the system to get free food by lying and then get angry at agents for escalating the case to a supervisor. You knew what you were doing, and of course we can see that you're doing it. I get it, we all need some help in life and I wish I got free food as well, but YOU are hurting the restaurants while abusing the vouchers. Whenever we issue a refund for you for your food allegedly being cold, that small local restaurant loses the money because of you. This is why we do this. Not because you don't deserve to eat, but because you need to look at the bigger picture. 

Don't assume you're the only person an agent is speaking to at the time. In peak hours, I get to be on 3 different chats at once, with 3 different people cursing and capslocking at me because their food is 10 minutes late. Please don't make it harder for us, or we're more likely to mess up or straight up leave the chat if you're being incredibly painful to deal with. 

Don't think that you did something by threating us with court, sack or social media. An agent doesn't care about any of that, you cannot make us lose our job unless we actually do something fatally wrong, and you're just gonna be known as ""that idiot"" in our office for the rest of the day.

Don't send me question marks if you see I'm already typing, it's annoying and isn't gonna make me type faster.

Don't ask for $21 if I said it would be $20. This is not Pawn Stars or Storage Battles, I can't increase your refund no matter how much you beg. If you even read the Terms and conditions before you came to demand refund, you could see that you're entitled to nothing except what we offer as a good will.

For god's sake, read my entire fucking message before writing a reply that would require me to repeat everything again. I swear sometimes I think people can't read, and that this is a much bigger problem for them than their can of drink missing from the order.

Please accept that some things take time. No, I can't transfer you to my supervisor right now, because they have a queue of stuff to do and calls to make. You WILL be contacted within x hours if I promise you that.

Leaving a bad rate for an agent - who you can clearly see did their best to help you - is really childish. I understand it's a way to express your frustration, but there is a bit difference between an outright rude/unhelpful agent, and someone who tries their best to be empathetic, even though they don't have an option to do what you want. Please realize this, the ratings affect us personally more than as a whole.

Using bad language will get you nowhere, other than maybe kicked out from the chat because an agent has a right to terminate the conversation if you're being abusive. So no - you are not above us, really, and can't ""make us stay on chat until you get what you want"".

We're not your servants. We're not the thieves who want to rob you either. We're just people who have some tools that can help you, OR at least be there to understand your concerns, and offer a solution, even if the solution isn't exactly what you wanted. Our empathy, as long as you're being reasonable, is not fake. 

The only reasons why sometimes we sound like robots are that either we have to use macros to improve quality score, or we are on multiple chats at the same time and physically cannot manage to write you a heartfelt message. I think that's not even the point of the service. We aren't friends and this is a professional setting. 

I see so many people complaining of ""customer help being a joke"" - it's not a joke, because it's exactly what it is, HELP for customers, and not a Refund Fairytale.

This is a food delivery app I'm talking about, so I definitely understand where people are coming from when they make complaints, and I was in their shoes sometimes. But if I managed to be understanding and polite to agents, and if people I know do the same, it's no excuse for so many entitled shits to act like they do.

Seek professional help if you can't curb your anger over a wrong burger that was compensated to you anyway, and seek a lawyer if you can't deal with not being offered a delivery charge refund, but for fuck's sake, don't assume the person you're speaking to via app at 11PM is either the defendant or the judge.

So I extended my 2 month contract into a 4 month one switching to part time (Im a full time student). Everything is same as always until my department decided they needed our team to assist the WAY busier and more traditional “call center” side of things. We had the proper training, it went from 45 minutes between calls to 10 seconds. It was hard but still within my capabilities. 

Then another 2 weeks passes and another contract for 2 months is signed  and they decide “nope were moving you all to outbound calling” with ZERO training with an entire new program, team, managers. So yesterday is my first day doing outbound calling with no training on gathering info. My manager starts hounding me to be faster and whenever I asked for help she left me on read. Queue a breakdown because I have no fucking clue what I am doing so I email her saying I need training I cant complete these tasks. She leaves me on read. Then starts hounding me about why I cant get work done even though I was not trained with these new systems. So this brings us to now where I have a “discussion” with said manager at 3 (I started at 2) and honestly....I have had enough of being tossed around and this is my last fucking day in a call center. Wish me luck everyone! (I have another job as well so ill be fine)

Update: Phone call with my manager went well :) I am finally free and she said she supports my decision to leave. Thank you all for being so encouraging!! (Also I still have my previous manager as a reference so this worked out perfect;) )",475,0,0

Gotta laugh at these crazy people sometimes,"I work for a city gov agency that connects people to other city agencies and programs. As CSRs on this sub, we all deal with rude or crazy customers that make us upset, but there's always a couple that just makes us laugh right?

"""Okay but what do I need to bring??""","First post here and on mobile, but I need to share this one while it's fresh.


For context I work for a smaller local credit union. I am in a ""call center environment"" but not actually in the call center. We help with loans and credit cards primarily, but can also assist with accounts, investments, deceased procedures, etc., and we are a very busy department as a result with only a dozen of us here as fully staffed. This has the benefit that our managers do not tolerate callers abusing or yelling at us, and we can exert a little more... humanity into calls if necessary. With that out of the way:


Me: Good afternoon, this is Grah from Local Credit Union, what can I assist you with today?""

Caller: ""Hello I'm calling to ask if you do Trust Accounts?""

Ew. That's a lot of paperwork. Thankfully most people want to see someone in person at a branch due to that.

M: ""Oh yes, of course! I can actually schedule an appointment to come in if you like. It just needs to be reviewed by a manager to make sure all the paperwork for the trust is there.""

C: ""Yes! I wondered if you needed one or not. So what should I bring with me to the appointment?""

M: ""Ah, the only things really is to make sure all the trustees are present and to bring the trust documents with you.""

C: ""It's just me, I was appointed by the previous. So what do I need to bring?""

M: ""That's no worries, it will show that in the documents that you bring with you.""

C: ""Yes but, what do I need to bring?""
Her tone began to ever so slightly sour.

M: ""You just need to bring the documents which states the directions a financial institution is required to follow. They can sometimes be almost a hundred pages.""

C: ""I get that, but what is that?""

M: ""Er, the trust documents?""
At this point I'm beginning to convey confusion in my voice.

C: ""Yes! I said I wanted to open a trust account!""

M: ""I know, it's okay! And that's what I mean, just bring the docs in for that.""

C: ""But while *ones*??""

M: ""Erhm, you did speak with a lawyer, correct? He gave you a large packet of papers, with signatures and notary stamps?""
At this point I'm beginning to think this is a weird prank call or something. An aura of confusion mixed with amusement filters through.

C: ""Yes I get that, but which ones do I being in?""

M: ""All of them.""

C: ""all of what??""

M: ""... The... trust documents? All the papers the attorney gave you.""

C: ""Okay but what ones??""

M: ""... ... All of them.""

Good 5 seconds of sustained silence.

C: ""Alright thanks for your help, bye""

The call that was the reason I quit,"Never posted on Reddit before so sorry if the formatting is bad or anything like that. This is also a long post so I'm sorry but this has been on my brain for months.

Bit of backstory, I started working at a call centre in June because I needed some money and they were offering work from home positions. The contract, while I obviously can't say exactly what it was, was a large american furniture company. The three weeks of training (yes, three) went by without issue and then after that I started as a full-on agent. On day six of taking calls this call came through that I can not forget. 

I answer the call in my usual way ""Thanks for calling customer care my name is (me), can i get your phone number please?"" (we got phone numbers and accounts up first before asking what we can do.

I ask how I can help them and he tells me ""theres a bit of a problem with my sons bed and we need someone to come and fix it""

I pull up the order, find the one he's talking about and get started on scheduling a repair tech to go out. I needed to know what specifically was going on so I asked ""what's going on with the bed?""

He tells me ""the front rail (it was a daybed) has sunk down and there are 14, yessir 14 nails sticking up out of it. They've torn the mattress apart and they're a safety hazard""

I ask him if anyone got hurt on it. ""My son got scratched very bad on it"" he says. So I start heading for a form for safety concern to fill it out, but the system wasn't working so I just had to schedule it the normal way. 

I get through the notes to scheduling and tell the customer that my first availability is two weeks away. He tells me straight up ""that won't work"". So of course at this point, I'm thinking 'oh great, one of these people that wants me to make things happen out of thin air'. I tell him I have no control over it and he says to me ""my son is non verbal autistic and loves that bed. He will not sleep anywhere else and I cannot have him cutting himself up on it every night""

My heart sank. I reached out for some help and thankfully one of my sup's took over on that one for me a few minutes later but I felt bad. I knew that guy was not going to get someone there any quicker than the two weeks I saw before. I had talked to many people before that had safety requests filled out and got nothing. 

And that killed me. I knew from the start I was not meant for customer service but I couldn't handle seeing that happen to someone again. That night I handed in my two weeks.

"""Don't kill yourself""","So on Tuesday this week, I got a call from a Policyholder asking for something in regards to their insurance claim. It is most likely just an update. That isn't really anything to do with my story.

At the end of the call the Policyholder advised that they would like to know my name. I said that my name was [First Name] and asked if they would like to know my surname. They advised that they would like to know my surname is Seabridge.

Upon hearing this, the said ""oh, well don't go jumping off and committing suicide"". 

I was shocked.

I had never heard anyone say anything like this. She laughed as she was only joking but it made me very uncomfortable. I tried to laugh it off and carried on.

The Gov’t doesn’t care,"Quick backstory so it makes sense: if you’ve ever dealt with federal insurance, there’s lots of paperwork involved, including a fancy form known as an ABN if they decide they’re not gonna pay. Basically three options 1: you still want them billed first and you can appeal their decision, 2: you’d rather just pay outright, 3: you don’t want the supplies. 
Personally I think #3 is stupid because they can just verbally say they don’t want it. 

So my liaison calls me up because a mom is calling him, saying our call center won’t let her refill. Her kid has Medicare, and I can promise you that kid is really sick if he has Medicare. 
About mid-September our renewal department called and sent her a new ABN to sign because it has to be renewed once per year. 
Mom actually selected option 3. In my 10 years of service I have *never* seen someone pick option 3. Not even accidentally. 
Our team spent from September to early October trying to reach this lady to say “ma’am are you sure??” And she never answered or called us back. 

Today she calls for a refill and all hell breaks loose. I didn’t mean to pick that option! I need my supplies. 
I’m sorry ma’am but the federal government doesn’t care what you meant to do. I wouldn’t say that but it’s the honest truth. 

Because she didn’t pay attention or answer her phone, we have already discharged the kid’s account, set up to get our feeding pump back, and now, to get services again, she’s gonna start allllll over like she never was on service with us. 

Well, I hope she learned she should read contractual documents from this.",45,0,0

"I’m not HR, I am not in charge of keeping track of employees.","For clarity I’m a front desk manager but this fits here the most because we also direct calls as part of our job description.

We get a shit ton of calls from debt collectors normally saying “hello can I speak to Mr Firstname Lastname?” 

Unfortunately...

Our telephone system is down right now, and I can’t transfer calls. 

I would normally transfer them to HR and then let HR tell them go to fuck themselves (yes this is how we deal with debt collectors) and that we are not involved and are not obliged to help. 

We had a busy long weekend with 100% occupancy so I was busy handling calls from customers and handling customers at the front desk. 

Here is one ridiculous call I got:

Debt collectors = DT me = FDM (front desk manager)

FDM: Hotelname, good morning.

DT: Hi can you put Firstname Lastname on the phone?

FDM: I don’t know who that is. Unfortunately I cannot transfer you to HR right now as our telephone system is broken.

DT: can you put me on hold and call them over to the phone?

FDM: (I lost it at this point) I’m sorry that’s not part of my job description. I am here to help and service paying customers not to keep track of our employees. We are having a very busy weekend so do not call us if you’re going to waste our time.

DT: I’m sorry. 

Honestly, I’m already really tired from showing guests around and I still have to deal with this shit. And no wonder customer service is a demanding industry.

"""can you not get a supervisor manager to override your security?!""","First real post here honestly so I'm kinda scared 😂

So earlier on today I had a call from a customer who seemed absolutely lovely, we had a great chat while I was helping with his query - until I had to take a payment.

Now this call should have taken all of 15-20 minutes (it's an insurance claim so kinda long) but it was almost an hour and 40 minutes and I ended up 50 minutes late on my break... Everything went fine bar the usual systems taking ages. When it came to the payment our payment system is really secure to the point we can't take a payment unless the card that's being used is registered to the address we have... Which this card wasn't (this guy stated it was the banks fault and kept reiterating that it was in no way my fault while having a go at me about our security system)

He acknowledged that I wasn't in the position to override this, so naturally he asked if we could override. I told him politely that it wasn't possible and it's the way the system we have is made to prevent fraudulent payments. He kept going on and on about it...

He then said it was a silly security question and asked for a manager to override it... At which point I bluntly said ""the only way we can override it is if we reprogram the whole system, so no"". And yet he just carried on. It was a real pain honestly... But he gave up eventually and said we'll be losing a customer once he made the payment.

Kinda short but it was hilarious at the time. I joked to one of my colleagues saying that if they wanted to pay for us to bring in a software engineer then fine we can rewrite the entire system just for this one guys payment",546,0,0
"""Why is my bill more? Nothing has changed.""","Sorry for any formatting issues, on phone, but just need to vent a little 

I work for an electricity provider, dealing with, quite obviously, calls and emails from customers, covering a wide variety of issues.

As one might guess from the title, a common query is higher bills. Now querying a high bill is fine. It's my job to help people figure out why it is higher. Sometimes it's simple, with things such estimates but sometimes it requires investigation.

I cannot people who will not help themselves. Me asking if anything at all has changed is to try and guide you towards those possible reasons. Outright denying a single thing has changed and it must be the metre helps no one.

You know what is currently a big change for people at the moment? Being at home all the time because of a global pandemic. Yes, maybe you did work from home already, maybe you are elderly and don't go out much, but I'm still willing to bet you were out somewhat in previous years.

Kids over here were out of school for an extra 3 month. TVs, consoles, chargers...they don't cost much to run, but if you have kids, likely these such appliances were on more this year and that will add up over time.

I apologise for the mini rant, I just wish people would use common sense and realistically look into their usage. I have worked here almost 3 years. I have yet to see a metre test find an actual faulty metre.

"I don't let a woman get 5 free hours of parking, so she calls the police.","So this a fresh one. Just happened about 30 minutes ago. A true Karen of Karens. I work for a parking company that manages a university's parking for them, said university also has a major medical center on site that we also manage parking for. 

&gt;Me: ""Hello, ParkingCompany how can I help you?""

&gt;Her: ""So, I was supposed to get a validation, but they told me their system was down and I'm disabled so I couldn't walk all the way to the other building to get one. I was here for 5 hours and they didn't see me and can you just open the gate for me?""

So, first off, I smelled some immediate bullshit on the ""systems were down"" comment. The medical center's stamp validators run off of our system so if they were down, our system would be down too. The medical center also stocks a significant number of ""offline"" validations that are just stickers you can put on your ticket. 

&gt;Me: ""I'm sorry ma'am, but I can't waive parking rates so unfortunately you will have to pay the balance shown on the screen to exit""

&gt;Her: ""Well I'm not paying, just let me out.""

Ahh, so that's her game.

&gt;Me: ""I can't do that ma'am, I'll send somebody over to assist you further.""

I hang up, and radio my field staff guy to head that way. I get about a minute of peace before the same woman calls back from the same help button, and I ignore it. Not going to talk to somebody who will be talking to somebody in person soon and who refused to pay. After about 3 minutes of having the call on waiting, it hangs up. I assume my field staff guy is there and I resume my usually nightly task of watching YouTube.

About 2 minutes later, I get a call from a # I recognize all too well. Its University PD Dispatch. Huh, wonder what's up. 

&gt;Me: ""Hello, Parking Company, how can I help you today?""

&gt;PD ""Hello, this is _____ With UniveristyPD Dispatch, we just got a call from a woman at GarageName, and were wondering if you had somebody on their way to assist them.""

&gt;Me: ""Yes, I'm aware of her. Somebody should be there now to help her.""

&gt;PD: ""Okay, thank you. That's all we needed.""

&gt;Me: ""No problem, when did she call you?""

&gt;PD: ""About a minute ago.""

As she was saying that, my field staff guy called me on the radio.

&gt;Field: ""Dispatch, she is refusing a Balance Due Form, and she said she's just going to wait for PD to show up""

&gt;Me: (To Field)""Uhhh, im on the phone with PD right now, give me a sec"" (To PD) ""Are you guys sending officers over to her?""

&gt;PD: ""Not at this time, no. Do you need us too?""

&gt;Me: ""Nooo...that won't be necessary unless she escalates. We should be able to handle it for now.""

&gt;PD: ""Alright, give us a call if you need anything."" 

&gt;Me: (To PD) "" Will do, goodbye."" (To Field) ""Yeah...I was just on the phone with PD Dispatch, they aren't sending anyone.""

&gt;Field: ""But she said she was going to wait for them? She's telling them we are keeping her here against her will.""

&gt;Me: ""Yeah, I'm not sure where she got the idea they were going to come out and let her out. Go ahead and fill out that Balance Due Form. Get her plate and mark it as leaving without payment and I'll raise the gate. We'll see what she does when the gate goes up.""

&gt;Field: ""Roger that.""

So I chill out for a couple of minutes while my field guy fills out the form with what we need. He gets it filled out and I raise the gate remotely, and she drives out and leaves to property. 

I get another call from PD right after I let her out. 

&gt;PD: ""Just calling to make sure, we were monitoring the situation and saw a vehicle just leave the center lane. Was that her?""

&gt;Me: ""Yup, that was her. Everything should be done with.""

&gt;PD: "" Sounds good, have a good night.""

&gt;Me: ""Thanks, you too.""

So, here is what I suspect happened after working here for so long. She showed up at the hospital with a rather minor issue, and was left in the waiting room for 5 hours while more serious patients were seen first. I suspect she started getting pissy and causing problems, so security booted her from the hospital and told her to leave. When they do that, they don't let you back in for anything short of you actually dying, so she was unstable to go back and get her ticket validated. She then tried her spiel on us so she didn't have to pay. Sorry Karen, not goanna happen.

Logical and simple, right?

Not to this customer. She was very upset that we would even CONSIDER cancelling her insurance for one missed payment. I tried explaining the above to her but she would not have it. In fact, she was so offended that she refused to make the payment, told me to just let the policy cancel, and she would take her business elsewhere since we were such a disrespectful company.

First month in a call center and I feel like there's still so much I need to learn/don't know.,"When do you stop feeling like you don't know anything, in this type of job? I've had a few different careers and some had training and others didn't. The ones that didn't you either learned on your own or were fired. This call center role is different for me because I do have training, but it's been a month and I still keep making mistakes. My supervisor has to remind me to do stuff, or I have to remember to ask customers this, and I always have to go to him for stuff I don't know or am unsure of.

How long did it take you to get over this?

The one thing I have in the back of my mind is that the manager always says on team meetings that even he is still learning stuff and they are constantly adding new features to their systems.

I got scammed. What are YOU gonna do about it?,"Ok so this happpened several weeks ago but I'm still kind of impressed by the audacity of this lady so I figured it would be entertaining enough to read.

Also I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting.

I work costumer service and reservations for a fairly big hotel company. Said company is big enough to have scammers calling around pretending to be us and offering vacation packages and whatnot to get people's information/money. Luckily, most people don't fall for this.

On the other side, the people who actually fall for these schemes can generally be divided in 2 groups; the angry ones and the enthusiastic ones.

The angry ones, as their name implies, call us to complain and demand we stop calling them. Their anger is understandable considering these people receive calls several times a day and sometimes very late at night (I've had people complain they've received calls at 3am). In these cases I can only apologize and explain it is not us calling but someone pretending to be us. I explain we are aware of the issue and are trying to shut them down but it's not something we can do from one day to the other, in the meantime I advice them to not give these people any kind of information, block the numbers they are receiving these calls from and even report them to the FTC, but that's pretty much everything I can do.

These calls, as unpleasant as they are, are not that hard to handle; Caller is angry, I apologize and explain the situation, they hang up either understanding or tell me to suck a dick before hanging up because that makes them feel better I guess. Only half joking here, that has happened a couple times.

The enthusiastic people though... Yeah those calls are a little bit tougher. These people are calling me all happy and excited and crushing their dreams, even if said dreams were based on lies, does feel a little bit bad.

Almost all of the enthusiastic people tell the scammers ""Oh thanks for the offer I will call you guys later"", then they find our reservations number online and call us only for one of our agents to tell them the truth. They're sad, we're sorry, the call ends.

But once in a blue moon, and by this I mean I've only heard of this happening once in like a year and a half from anyone in my center, the scammers get what they want.

Now, onto the story.

At about 5pm I got a call and I answered as I always do.


Me: Good afternoon, thank you for calling [Hotel Company]. My name is WoodenHandMagician, How can I help you today?

Linda: Hey good afternoon, my name is Linda (Not her actual name. I don't remember her actual name) and I was calling regarding a vacation package I was offered.


At this point I started asking questions. Most of the times these calls are about scams but some of our hotels do offer vacation packages and the like so I just gotta be sure before saying anything.


Me: So this is a package you were offered because you stayed at one of our hotels or-

Linda: Nono, I received a call from you guys the other day, they say I was eligible for a one week vacation package in Las Vegas.

Me: Oh I see and these people said they worked with us?

Linda: Yeah it was a call from you guys, I already paid $100 for the package they told me to call you when I was ready to book.

Oh... fuck.

Me *trying to figure out how to say it*: Ah I understand. I'm very sorry ma'am but... But that was not us.

Linda: What do you mean?

Me: Unfortunately we have people going around claiming to work with us and asking for people's information and card details. We have been trying to shut them down but we've had no success so far. We don't call people unless they called first to ask for information. We only send emails and that's to people who sign up for them.
What you can do is get in touch with your bank an-

Linda: Wait what?

Me: As I said ma'am, those people did not work for us. I'm very sorry to say this but you got scammed. Like I was telling you you shou-

Linda: And what are you gonna do about it?

*Insert white guy blinking meme*

Me: Sorry?

Linda: Yes. What are you gonna do for me?

Me: Well... There's nothing we can do at this point I'm sorry. We can't reverse a payment because you didn't pay us anything and we can't give you a room because you have not paid us anything.
As I told you, your best bet is calling your bank and asking them to-

Linda: What do you mean you can't do anything? I ALREADY PAID 100 DOLLARS

Me: I'm sorry ma'am but, as I already told you, you gave your money to someone else. You haven't paid us anything. Again, at this point calling your bank-

Linda: I want a supervisor.

Me: Ma'am they will tell you the same thing, please call your-

Linda: I WANT A GOD DAMN SUPERVISOR

Me: *sigh* Sure thing just hold on one second.


As you can imagine, she did not get a week kn Vegas.

Tl;dr: Lady got scammed and wants me to do something about it. She doesn't understand we can't do anything about it.

I refuse to give you the information you need to do your job.,"Hi all! so to start off I currently like my job and just got promoted as of today! slight pay raise and staying in a different department! currently working for a major credit card that treats you the way you treat you. I had to an option to move over to our billing department and I took it and I get a few people that either want to dispute everything from when they signed up and started using the card to the ones that refuse to even tell me their name or their reason for calling or getting transferred to me. This one was a fun one recently that I just cant understand why he would even call in the first place.

ME= Me
AC= Angry customer

Me: ""Hello this is durboki in the -Insert state here- center, may I have your full name please.""

AC: ""what who is this?""

ME: repeats opening line

AC: ""Why did I get transferred over here?! I have a problem I need solved send me back to the last person NOW!""

ME: ""Im sorry sir but I cannot do that as we have no way to connect with individual reps, But Id be more than happy to help you out here and now! I just need your full name""

AC: ""Why do I have to give you my name I gave it to the last guy?""

ME: ""I still need to confirm who I am speaking with before proceeding with the account for security reasons""

AC: ""I don't wanna give my name, send me back to the last guy I was talking to""

ME: ""Well sir I cant send you to the last guy you were sent to but I can get you to the department that you came from, do you remember what department you were speaking with?""

AC: ""No, why wont you people help me I just want to dispute charges""

ME: ""Well sir that is why they transferred you here then, I am the one to help you dispute charges, Im with our Billing assistance! and It would be my pleasure to help you get a dispute started, I just need your first and last name and then to ask a few questions around the charge you are disputing.""

AC: ""Fine its ANGRY CUSTOMER""

ME: ""excellent! now what charge are we looking to dispute today and what is going on? what is the amount and date of the charge?""

AC: ""I just told this to the last guy!""

Que me checking his notes on his account and we got nothing, just that he was transferred to start a dispute.

Me: ""I understand sir but he did not leave any notes on the account or send me anything pertaining to your situation, I will need you to repeat your inquiry. and I may have further questions pertaining to the situation that may have not been answered or asked when you were with the previous rep""

AC: ""I don't wanna repeat myself, go ask the other guy! jesus you people cant do anything""

ME: ""Im sorry sir, but I cannot connect with the previous rep to get that information, if you don't want to repeat it again now if time is an issue we are open 24/7 7 days a week, you are more than welcome to call back at a later time if that works out better for you?""

AC: ""NO YOU GUYS ARE GONNA SOLVE THIS FOR ME NOW! I DONT WANNA TALK TO YOU GET ME TO THE OTHER GUY I WAS JUST SPEAKING WITH!""

ME: ""Again, I cannot connect you with the previous rep, if you do not wish to speak with me on the matter I can see if we have a supervisor available?""

AC: ""GODDAMNIT NO!! GET ME TO THE OTHER REP NOW I DONT WANNA SPEAK WITH YOUR SUPERVISOR I WANT THE OTHER REP TO DISPUTE MY CHARGE HE HAS ALL THE INFORMATION AND KNOWS WHAT I WANT TO DISPUTE! I REFUSE TO HANG UP UNTIL YOU GET ME CONNECTED TO THE PREVIOUS REP""

Me: ""well sir, as I have mentioned I cannot do that and the previous rep cant dispute your charges as he is not part of our Billing assistance, only we cant initiate disputes. Since you do not want to tell me any information about the inquiry nor would you want me to help you I will have to end the call, I hope you have a great day!""

AC: ""WHY ARE YOU HANGING UP THE CALL MY PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED YET! DONT HANG UP THE PHONE! WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS?!""

ME: ""Well sir if you want to tell me the information I need to put the dispute in Id be more than happy to help! but we cannot initiate the dispute until you tell us this information. Now what is the name of the charge and what date was it made on""

AC: ""I ALREADY TOLD YOU TO TALK TO THE OTHER REP TO GET THAT INFO IM NOT REPEATING MYSELF!""

ME: ""Well sir I have tried multiple times to assist but you will not let me help you, have a great day!""

AC: ""I AM NOT HANGING UP UNTIL YOU HELP ME!!!!""

And that's when I ended the call. Like seriously dude you need to work with us in order to help you. I cant read minds and I have no way of reaching out to the previous rep for that info, its faster and easier if you tell me as they are already on a call or could be on their break.

Another sob story to get money? Cool!,"I’m going to preface this by saying I might sound evil for saying this but Jesus fucking Christ I hate all the pity stories angry customers give me to try to get goodwill from me.

Then when I follow protocol and deny their request, they use it to attack me and call me heartless. This shit is such a cheap, manipulative tactic I hate it and hate how they try to guilt trip me!

The Call that Did Me In,"It's a normal day in the cu-bi-cle, a normal day for a guest call. Would you be mine? Could you be mine?

Call starts off and a gruff voice tells me he wants to book a room at our El Dorado resort. Guy is no nonsense and his speech is short and to the point. Sounds very military. Despite his lack of small talk, I eventually get him to share that he is indeed a veteran and that he and his old army buddy have a tradition every year of booking a room at our El Dorado resort and tying one on like the old days.

I thank him for his service, tout the newly renovated bar lounge, as well as a few other places around campus that my brother recommends (he's a bartender and I don't drink so I rely on him) and tell him I'm pleased to report we do in fact have a room for his dates. The call, so far, is easy peasy lemon squeezy.

Then he said it.

Grizzled Army Vet: ""And that's not a king bed, right?""

Me: ""Yes sir, that is correct. The standard room comes with two queen beds.""

Grizzled Army Vet: ""Okay, good. We're not in the navy, ya know.""

Time of Death: 3:02 pm.

I was done. Fell right out of my chair to the floor, laughing at the top of my lungs, pounding the cubicle wall. I don't know why that hit me so hard. Maybe it was the mock serious voice, the smile I could hear over the phone as he landed his joke, or just my own family history of army vs navy jokes, but I was absolutely useless for the next few minutes. Everyone within a few rows was popping up to figure out why I was suddenly interrupting their calls with laughter and my leader had to ask if I was okay.

My new favorite guest gave a chuckle and said he appreciated a man with a ""sophisticated sense of humor"" lol. I hated that our call only lasted another few minutes past that, as he turned out to be a really awesome guy. I wished him a great trip with his buddy and sent word to the resort to give him a little something extra for their stay as thanks for brightening my day.

Remember: always listen to an old soldier's stories!

"No, I don't want you checking if I might be alone in my flat dying from COVID","Hi there!
This is my first ever post on reddit and English is not my native language so please be gentle with me. Also, I hope this is the right place for this tale.

I work in the health department and among other things I am responsible for calling people that are currently quarantined for COVID asking about their general health. If they are not feeling well I refer them to a on-call doctor, or, in really urgent cases, call an ambulance for them. This is to make sure nobody gets left alone and unnoticed with their symptoms getting worse while they are not allowed to leave the house to see a doctor.

We are currently extremely busy as the cases go up rapidly, so we have to prioritize who we call. As you can imagine, we mostly call elderly persons or persons that already have conditions making a bad COVID disease likely.

Yesterday I called a young, otherwise perfectly healthy woman. We had a kind of dead point which was unexpected so I had time to call her. Her previous symptoms of COVID where pretty light but better check right? M: me, P: patient


She picked up the phone.

M: hello, this is...

P: Hello???? Who's calling?

M: yes this is me calling from the health department of city, I'm calling to...

P: no. *click*

"""Is the stock market going to crash?""","I work for a military-affiliated credit union. I deal with people's money. This call took place about a week ago. I really wish QA would've pulled this one. It probably would've given them a laugh.

I had one lady call, opening the call like this: ""I know you're not a financial advisor, but do you think I should pull my money out of my accounts? Do you think the stock market will crash with the elections?""

Me: ""...ma'am..."" Cue white guy blinking gif. ""...I don't know if the stock market is going to crash, and as you stated, I'm not a financial advisor, but there are federal protections for a certain amount of money per member."" 

I gave her a tl;dr history lesson about the stock market crash of 1929, Black Tuesday, and the resulting federal protections. I explained the FDIC and it's purpose. Credit unions are actually insured by the NCUA, but the same coverage applies as with the FDIC. She had quite a bit in her accounts with us, but not enough to reach the insurance threshold.

L: ""Well, what should I do? Do you think the stock market will crash because of the elections? Is that money REALLY safe in the bank?""

M: ""...ma'am, as previously stated, I'm not a financial advisor; however, I wouldn't pull it. Not only will it not be insured, but storing large amounts of cash or checks written for large amounts is not secure and potentially dangerous."" I tried to reassure her, repeating the bit about the FDIC and the insured amount. 

L: ""Okay, but what if..."" I ended up repeating the same insurance speech and history lesson again before she was satisfied with the answer. She thanked me and disconnected. She was actually very nice, and other than the strange reason for calling, there was nothing weird about it. 

I've been getting political commentary on calls for the last two months. I'm working the day before, of, and after the election. It's only going to get a thousand times worse. Please pray for my fucking sanity. I wish all of you working those days luck. We'll (hopefully) make it out alive.",13,0,0
Don’t you send bills before their due anymore? I only received my bill due on 1 December 2020 today.,"Obligatory; on mobile, sorry for any formatting issues. 

So, this happened yesterday. For clarity, as the dates are important here, yesterday was Friday, 30 October 2020. I work in billing for a type of property company where we look after the common property aspects of unit blocks in Australia. Being the last business day of October, I sent out the bills (they’re called levy notices and are due quarterly) that are due on 1 December 2020.

I receive a reply from a customer who receives his levy notices via email, asking why I no longer sending out levy notices in advance. Complaining he only just received his levy notice that’s due on 1 December 2020, and it’s already overdue. Except...what? 

It was a lot more detailed than that, asking the same question in a whole variety of ways. Such, as “when did you stop sending the levy notices in advance?”. And “if you’re going to send my levy notices after the due date, do I have to remember to pay them earlier?”. 

I did respond in the best way I could manage, without asking him if he’s living in the future, and if so, what’s it like and did Trump or Biden win the US election?",828,0,0
But you offered it!,"One of the most annoying team leaders I ever had honestly believed EVERY guest could be helped, no matter how impossible their request. She was wrong.

It was a normal day, and then my phone beeped.

Me: ""Thank you for calling \[Popular Theme Park\] Travel Company, my name is Walter (fake stage name), how can I help you today?""

Guest: ""Yes, I'm looking to make a reservation at your ""Pine Tree Lodge resort"". I'd like the room you're advertising with two king beds.""

Me: ""You mean two queen beds....""

Guest: ""No, two kings. I'm reading it on the website.""

Me: ""Sir, the rooms in that resort have two queen beds, or a queen and a set of bunk beds. I can request a single king bed, is that what you mean?""

""No, you aren't listening to me. I can read, okay? It says two king beds. I want two king beds.""

Me: ""Okay Sir, one moment. Let me look at what you're looking at.""

So I pulled up the website and looked at the resort. Whelp....somebody dun goofed. The website said that our Pine Tree Lodge resort had two king beds in their rooms. And as the guest bible says, ""thus, if the website spaketh it, it musteth be trueth.""

 Me: ""Sir, I am really sorry about this, but that is a typo. The room has two queen beds, not two kings.""

Guest: ""That's not a typo, that's a f\*cking lie! You put it, you have to honor it. Now get me the room I want!""

Me: ""I can't sir, it doesn't exist.""

Guest: ""Well the website says it does. So what's the problem?""

Me, getting frustrated: ""The problem is, we don't have rooms with two kings. They simply don't exist. There's no way for us to do that for you. We can't give you what we don't have.""

For those of you thinking, ""why not just tell him all the rooms were filled,"" yes, that would have been smarter, and hindsight is 20/20. When I get focused on something, I sometimes can't get past that particular thought.

We went back and forth for over fifteen minutes. No matter how I phrased ""Does. Not. Exist."" He didn't get it, or just didn't care. I offered better rooms, discounts, options. Nada. Finally I started losing my cheery disposition.

Guest: ""So you're telling me you won't get me the room you're advertising?""

Me: ""No sir. I'm telling you I CAN'T get you that room, I can't even get ME that room.""

Guest: ""Are you getting an attitude with me?""

My brain: \*No, but that dam's about to burst\*

Me: ""Sir, what do you want me to do, here?""

Guest: ""I want you to get me the room I want, that YOU offered.""

Me: ""All right, Sir. It will be available in 2014."" (This was 2010)

Guest: ""What are you talking about? Why?""

Me: ""Well it's going to take me a while to learn how to build a new wing, then construct the new rooms, then have the king beds delivered.""

Guest: ""GET ME YOUR SUPERVISOR RIGHT NOW!""

My brain: \*hot sh\*t, no survey\*

That's not how this works.,"So earlier today, I was in the last 30 minutes before clocking out for the day. I picked up the call and it seemed to be an older gentleman that just radiated entitlement over the phone. The EntitledBastard (EB) gave me his name and said he wanted to suspend his paper delivery. I said I could get that set through but I would need his address for verification. He gave me that I went to the suspension screen in his account and asked him what dates.

EB: ""I told you I wanted to stop the paper tomorrow and resume on Friday, November 13th.""

Me: ""Alright, I can get that set through, but the first date of the suspension will have to be in 2 business days. I can start that on Monday, November 2nd.""

EB: ""Fine. Very well. Now I want you to remain on the line until I receive the email confirmation.""

Me: ""Sir, the email is automated and could take up an hour to come through.""

Now the conversation just kind of went back and for of me asking him if there was anything I could do to help him, him saying I didn't do anything to help him. Him comparing my service to bring him a hamburger when he ordered a steak. Him informing me that he was the customer and I have to listen to him, and my CSR skills were horrible and he had no idea why I hadn't been fired yet. And just so much BS for so long, so indirectly pitched to him ""If there is nothing else I can do to help you, would you like to speak to someone else."" and thankfully he took that and requested the supervisor. I told sup what was up and finally ended my conference with this entitled basted. The sup messaged me later and was kinda like ""Wtf was he on. He tried belittling me too.""

I had time for one last call after that, and thankfully it was an extremely nicer man that canceled out EB completely, so I ended up with an overall good day.",27,0,0
"""Felt cute. Might call in to fight a tech support rep for no reason, idk""","Guy calls in all pissed and ranting because one of his customers got a ""page not secure"" error when viewing his website.

I basically find the problem while he's bitching - there's a broken picture on his main page, and all he has to do is log in and delete it. I wait for him to quiet before I try explaining what he needs to do to fix it.

Nope. He still wants to battle me, demanding why it happened, saying it happened two years ago and demanding to know why it happened *then.*

Try to explain that I can't speak to what happened two years ago because I wasn't actually working at the company then. Dude keeps cutting me off, so I start cutting him off. Then he starts lecturing me not to talk when he's talking.

He keeps demanding to know why  it happened. I straight up tell him I have found the problem and I am trying to show him where to fix it. We get halfway to where he needs to be before he flips out again and keeps saying he doesn't *care* about XYZ, he just wants it fixed.

Explain that he *has* to go to his site settings to delete the image causing his site to get flagged as not secure. It would have taken him five clicks, max. He cuts me off halfway into *that* explanation saying he doesn't *caaaare* about his site settings or any images, he just wants it fixed.

So he's clearly one of these types, to which I usually just go the route of fixing it myself and then being like, ""there it's fixed"". But, we're trained to not make any changes to our clients' websites or settings without their go-ahead. So I try to talk him through what I PERSONALLY WILL DO to fix the issue.

Still. Not. Enough. Bastard STILL cuts me off in the middle saying he *doesn't caaaare* and continues to bitch about his customer and his web presence.

It's a few minutes after we're to leave for the day. I am tired, and I am very hungry, and both of those factors combined isn't really doing much to quell my growing anxiety. I'm sitting there speechless for several minutes unsure how to proceed.

Finally, HE ends the call saying that he and I don't see eye to eye, asked for my name, and that if he ever called tech support again, he'd make sure not to get me. HE is the one who said ""we're getting nowhere"" after he spent the past 15-20 minutes ***ACTIVELY REFUSING TO LET ME FIX THE PROBLEM****.* I just told him I'd look into it.

Ended up DMing my manager and letting him know the whole exchange. Manager gave me the go-ahead to just delete the picture and let him know the problem was fixed since the guy was being that difficult about it. I sent him a sickly sweet, obnoxiously happy-go-lucky email telling him this, signed with a closer I *never* use:

"Work On A Computer That's Well Out Of Warranty? Thanks, But No.","Someone jogged my memory about call I’d blocked out. 

I did remote tech support for a company that contracted out to a major cable company and office supply stores. I got a call from Delusional Customer. 

DC: Hi. You guys did some work on two computers for me and one of them isn’t working. 

OP: Ok. Do you have the receipt or your name so I can look it up?

DC: My name is Delusional Customer. 

OP: Thanks. Give me a minute. 

I look up the name and find that, yes, we did work on two laptops for him……….two years ago. 

OP: Hey, thanks for waiting. Yes, I found the order and, yes, we did the work. Unfortunately, the work was done two years ago and it’s out of warranty. 

DC: Out of warranty? How can it be out of warranty?

OP: Well, it’s been two years so….

DC: No. You don’t understand. I just turned it on for the first time today. 

OP: Um. So you had two laptops worked on and you only turned one of them on?

DC: Yes. Correct. So now you have to fix the one that’s not working. 

OP: I’m…pretty sure we can’t do that. Again, the work was done two years ago. 

DC: I get that. But, obviously, you didn’t fix one of them because it’s not working. Look. I was using the other one up until yesterday and it died. So I went to go use this one and it’s not working. So you need to fix it.

OP: Okay. So what you’re saying is that you got it fixed two years ago but you never bothered to check whether it was actually fixed.

DC: \[Smugly\] Yes. So fix it. 

While this is going on, I’m IM’ing with my supervisor who’s cracking up. Under no circumstances can I do anything on this Delusional Customer’s dead machine. He’s not going to give up and continues to make his case which continually gets shot down.

DC: So…you’re fixing it. 

OP: Look. Can I give you an example of what I’m hearing?

DC: Sure.

OP: So, you run a garage. Someone brings in two cars to get repaired. One is the primary car and the other they just leave in the driveway for two years. After two years, the primary car dies. They go to the back up car they’ve left in the driveway for two years and it doesn’t work. So you’re saying that when the tow truck drops off the dead car at your garage, that you’ll gladly repair a car that was never driven for two years?

DC: (after a fun, awkward pause) Well……….yeah. I would. Sure. Yeah.

OP: With all due respect, I don’t believe you. There is literally no way you could verify what’s actually happened in the past two years with that car.

DC: Look. I’d…want to take pride in my work and make the customer happy.

OP: So do I. But I’d be a horrible businessman if just let people void the warranty. 

DC: Well, come on, the warranty should start from the time you start using it. 

OP: Um. No. If you’d turned it on two years ago and it didn’t work, certainly we’d fix it. But not now. Sorry. 

DC: (grumbles for a few more minutes) Well. I think it’s wrong. 

OP: I totally understand you think so. But I’ve been chatting with my supervisor and he says no. 

DC: Well. Ok. Whatever. Bye.",196,0,0

No storm came through here,"It's hard to believe people exist who are so anti science and deny everything from Vaccines to Climate change but with callers like the ones I speak with today its very clear that they are real.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Warning, I am an electric company employee talking about the outages caused by a storm, I sympathize with those without power. Don't take my story as being heartless.\*

&amp;#x200B;

I am a Floridian but as my company is multistate, the incident I am talking about is the outages caused by Hurricane Zeta that is currently affecting the east coast further north of here. Unfortunately the storm has seen over 250,000 people without power and plenty of them are calling in with questions as to when their power will be back on.

As a personal bias, I've always thought our partner state's customers were much nicer about outages. Floridians lose power for a minute and lose it. However today's storm has us giving ETA's of restoration that so far are in the DAYS not hours like they normally are so that hospitality is really being tested.

Que the storm denier. I'm always prepared to speak to angry customers after a storm who yell about how we should be repairing faster or we should have done more to prepare. I wasn't quite ready for this guy who flat out refused to accept a storm went through the state. He was adamant that it was just a light breeze today and not even enough to shake a tree, so there is no way his power should be out. He refused to believe that there are over 250,000 people without power because I couldn't prove that to him so I must be lying. Worst of all, he drove around the block and saw power on several streets away so clearly that means nothing could be wrong that doesn't take more than a flip of a switch to fix. I've dealt with plenty of Floridians claim ""the storm wasn't that bad, it was only a category 3!"" but I just had no words for the argument that the storm didn't happen at all. It turned into the worst type of call, just having to raise my voice over the customer to tell them that yes a storm DID travel across the state. 

If you are in the affected areas of Zeta, I wish you well and if you have new information please do call and report it! But please know that calling and yelling at us does not help.",70,0,0
"How to handle a customer who keeps interrupting you, and won't let you get a word in edge wise.","This is going to sound crazy, but is a master level of conversational passive aggressiveness.

You all know the type, the customer that interrupts you at every turn, bulldozing over whatever explanation they've asked you to provide, or perhaps options you want to lay out to them to choose from. These people are their own worse enemies and its your job to save them from themselves, but they just wont let you talk.

The second you do get a moment to speak, begin as normal and tell that asshole ""ok so as i was saying....hey, you know what, I forgot what i was going to say.""

It forces the customer to realize they NEED you. Either to tell them the information they want to know or what options they have. It makes them realize they are being overpowering conversational assholes and every time I have told a customer this, they have apologized for interrupting and its much easier to speak with them after.

Wherein a caller tells me some fabulous stories,"Many moons ago, I worked at a reservations call center for an international chain.

One of my favorite calls came in around midnight ET on a Sunday night.

A very friendly older woman (I assumed she was older because her voice had that wavy sound) wanted to book a stay at our hotel on Cape Cod near Hyannis.

Once that was settled and she had written down the confirmation number (this was 1986), she began to tell me a long story about her late husband who had been best friends with [Sargent Shriver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargent_Shriver) (father of Maria) and how they used to pal around with all the Kennedy boys at the Hyannisport compound and how sad it was that Bobby had died so young and what a good president he would have been. She told me she knew Jackie and her sister, Lee Radziwill, and how she'd known Jackie when they'd attended Miss Porter's School in Connecticut, etc, etc.

At the time, I was but a young gayling, so the only name I recognized was Kennedy. I had no real idea where Cape Cod was or who any of the other people were but her stories were mesmerizing. None of it felt like namedropping. It just sounded like someone who was reminiscing.

I was on the line for about half an hour before the only floor supervisor (FS) on duty showed up and made a slashing motion across her throat with her finger as a sign for me to hang up. I told the woman that, I was sorry, but I had to take another call. She replied and said she hadn't thought about any of that for a very long time and mentioned how nice I'd been to listen.

After the call ended, I put myself on unavailable since the FS was still standing there. She told me she'd been monitoring the call from the beginning and that she'd waited for as long as she thought she could get away with before coming to tell me to disconnect. She then began to explain who all the people were (she was in her 40s, I think) and how the caller had obviously lived an amazing life. Or she was an amazing liar.

Either way, the stories were awesome. Since then, I've lived on Cape Cod and have been to some of the places the woman mentioned. Every now and then I'll read a story about someone and realize this was someone this marvelous woman (allegedly) knew.

True or not, this was a wonderful gift that I've always treasured.

Why I didn't pay my bill...,"I used to work in a collections center for one of the big credit card companies. I worked in the 1m late which was anything up to 30 days after they missed their first payment. 

I thought I might give you a few of the entertaining gems I still remember as to why people had failed to pay their bills.

1. My father died (the client had literally used this every time they were late for 4 years. He was late about every other month).
2. I forgot to pay my bill because of Jimmy Carter's presidency. (This was in the early 2000s)
3. It's all Clinton's fault!
4. My dog ate the credit card, so I didn't think I had to pay it anymore.
5. I was abducted by aliens 
6. Dave Ramsey said not to pay my credit cards (smh)
7. My sugar daddy quit
8. Credit Cards are a government conspiracy to enslave the people of the world.

For those wondering here are the saddest reasons I was given.

1. I had more refunds than my minimum payment, so I didn't think I had to make a payment. I had to explain that refunds didn't count towards the payments.
2. I decided to say I declare bankruptcy, so I don't have to pay bills now.   
\~\~After asking for their lawyer's info I found out that they didn't have a lawyer, and hadn't filed it through court, they just said ""I declare bankruptcy"" and thought that was all they had to do. Sadly I had to explain to them that's not how bankruptcy works. 
3. The person who literally lost their entire family in a car accident and only survived because they had to work and couldn't leave with the rest of the family for the vacation. They had planned on driving up the next day.",63,0,0

Confessing to fraud,"This happened years ago, but I still think about it sometimes. I worked in a third party verification call center for an internet provider and had to call customers to clarify information on their internet services orders. One time I called this lady and asked to speak with the person on the order, who she stated was her husband. She said she could verify everything because he wasn’t home. I told her I had to speak with the person whose name was on the order. We went back and forth with me explaining policy and her saying it was stupid. Then she lost her temper and said “well my husband is dead so you can’t speak to him!”

The Day I Freaked Out my new Team Leader.,"The Theme Park Travel Company I worked for had hundreds of agents, all split into teams, each with a team leader. Because your team leader could change every time your schedule did, you wound up being on several teams as your schedule needs change, so every six months it was ""first day of school"" again as your new team got to know each other and the new leader (presuming you haven't had them before).

Most of the leaders were great and each had their own style of management and learning. One leader (we'll call her Martha, and I'll stick to my fake stage name Walter) was an absolute sweetheart, and had a tradition with new teams of testing their ""powers of observation"" as she put it, because that was very important on the phones.

So, she sat in a chair in front of us in the meeting room and gave us a few minutes in silence to make notes about what we observe.

I was sitting towards the front on the right side of the room. By luck, she chose the left side of the room to start. Everyone said the usual things. ""You're Caucasian. You've got blonde/formerly blonde hair, you dress professionally, you're wearing XYZ, you have brown eyes, you have a nice smile"" etc. As more people spoke, it was repeats or ""what they said.""

Then it came to my turn. Now, I'm a fairly observant person, even though I tend to look like I'm lost in my own head. Plus, I was told to focus on her and write down \*all\* my observations about her. Okie dokie. I figured I'd see how many good guesses I could make and started picking at details I noticed. Buckle up, kids.

Martha: ""Walter, have you got anything else?""

Me: \*Takes a deep breath\* You were born and raised in the midwest, I'm guessing Missouri, and you lived there until after college, at which point you moved to Florida. Your father was in the armed forces. You were raised Catholic and went to Catholic school until at least through 8th grade. You're divorced but on good terms with your ex. You have a daughter and a grandson. You're trying to quit biting your nails and you've been on a diet for a few weeks. Oh, and all the stuff they said.""

\*Crickets\*

Various Team members: What? How? WHAT?

Martha: That was...impressively detailed.

Team member: Wait, he's RIGHT?

Martha: Well I lived in Missouri until I was thirty, and I was in Catholic School through tenth grade. \*looks at me\* How did you do that?

I explained about her posture, the way she sat with her ankles crossed and hands in her lap, her trace of an accent showing she'd grown up to develop an accent, but moved away long enough for it to dilute and pick up Florida expressions, the wedding ring she wore around her neck on a small chain, the way her clothes were slightly loose showing she'd lost some weight, her fingernails were self evident, and I saw the photo of her daughter and grandson on her desk. Her bearing and speech indicated a certain upbringing and given her age and such I guessed army dad, etc.

I may have had more details in there, but this was a decade ago so my memory might have forgotten a detail or two.

Martha and I got along great, and I learned a lot from her, but she always was very careful what she said near me in case I started using my psychic powers again. :D

When Between-Call Reading Tries to Come to Life,"I work in an insurance call center handling complex technical calls and taking escalated calls. Most of my calls are ho-hum technical calls. I handle escalations about billing and underwriting, which are usually a variation of ""how dare you tell me that you won't insure me for free."" The call I'm about to describe is probably one of the most memorable deviations from the norm I've ever had. 

Picture it: My junk room-turned-office space in these times of COVID with your intrepid writer waiting for a call. In one hand is my third can of Diet Coke for the night. In the other hand is a copy of a Stephen King novel. Not just any Stephen King novel, but Dreamcatcher. The headset beeps and the call comes through from one of the new reps on the phone in sales.

Newbie tells me customer wants to reinstate his policy. One that's been cancelled for eight months, mind you. She's told him no, you need to rewrite. He doesn't want to rewrite because he doesn't like the quote. He wants a manager to override this and reinstate the cancelled policy. I'm salty because I was getting to a good part of the book and there's no way in hell I can do what he's asking. So I have her send him on through.

He comes on the line and we review the policy together. He actually doesn't owe money on this cancelled policy, but it cancelled because he didn't complete basic follow up for verification purposes. Since our underwriting department requested the follow up and it never got completed, they cancelled the policy. If your policy is going to be cancelled for any reason, your insurance company is legally required to send you notification via USPS to give you sufficient notice. We can also email it if you've selected the Online Documents option, as customer had. We had sent at least two notices about the cancellation, as well as around five or six reminders for follow up, only to get radio silence in response.

I explain to him that we've sent notices via email and USPS. He tells me in the most matter-of-fact tone possible that he won't check the mail or emails we send because the aliens are clearly tracking him this way. Without missing a beat, he proceeds to tell me that he was abducted by aliens shortly after he started this auto policy. Buddy here not only managed to involve extra-terrestrials, but apparently chemtrails are really what you see when their spaceships enter the atmosphere from the home planet. And for those of you who are curious, it only took him twenty-five seconds to then mention that anal probing is a thing, but is actually gentler than you'd think, what with all the vibrating.

Keeping a straight face while telling him that alien abduction wasn't a valid reason for reinstating a policy was difficult, but not the hardest part. I had to mute the phone when he told me that he objected to the new quote because the premium for the term was $666. This allegedly would allow the aliens to start tracking him again. But he also didn't want to change anything about the quote or the payment method.

Surprisingly enough, he was totally cool with me telling him no to the reinstatement. He went on to say the aliens had mentioned they had infiltrated every government entity in the world, so he wasn't surprised. But he did thank me for my time and patience.",430,0,0
Gotta love the ones who think they know more than you.,"I work for a popular roadside assistance call center in this is one of the more interesting calls I got today.

M:  Oh okay I'd be happy to help.

* Goes through basic verification and pulls up membership*

M:  Well ma'am I don't see that we received the payment you sent. You said you sent it through online bill pay?

C:  Yes.

M:  Online bill pay as in the bank either sends out a check or electronic payment on your behalf right?

C: yup.

M:  Okay well since we have not received the payment the check the bank sent may have gotten lost in the mail. If you contact the bank they should be able to stop payment and reverse the funds back to your account.

C: No. It was sent electronically by the bank. 

M:  Did you verify with the bank that it was sent electronically?

C: No. But I know it was. 

M:  We don't have an account and routing number to receive funds electronically. The only way online bill pay could work is by the bank sending a check. 

C:  No. It was definitely sent electronically using your an account and routing number.

M: *annoyed* Ma'am what's the account and routing number you gave the bank to send the funds electronically to us?

C:  I don't remember but I have the account and routing number for my checking account. Do you want it?

M: Ma'am I don't need that.  I used to work for a financial institution and dealt with online bill pay. Since we don't have an account and routing number to receive payments we could not possibly have received your funds electronically which means it was most likely sent by check on behalf of the bank.  Now we can open a research case  but that takes about 48 business hours so I the highly recommend you contact your bank and they should be able to stop the check and reverse the funds much quicker.

C: NO!  I'm not contacting my bank because they won't be able to do anything!  These funds were not sent by check. They were sent electronically.

M: ..........Ma'am we will go ahead and open a research case and follow up with you in about 48 business hours....

It’s only temporary so I keep pushing myself to just get through to the end of it, but it’s wearing me down more and more each day.

The charger you sold me burned my $2.000 computer,"So, this is actually something common to happen, but still is ridiculous lol.

I work in the rainforest retailer, and at least 2 or 3 times per week all of the CSA's get a contact with the charger of a MacBook that... Is not original basically. 

Almost everytime the complain is that it's not working anymore, that it got too hot, that it sparkled, nothing too serious, and we educate the customers not to buy them.

Once in a while, we have the mighty and fearsome Karen, who is the unlucky one that purchased that charger but this time is her laptop the one who got damaged for the voltage difference. By the terms and conditions, we will be able to send a replacement if available, or refund the money, but we won't be responsible for damages caused for the charger in this case.

Obviously, this Karen is not to blame for purchasing a $20 chinese charger instead of the $70-$50 original one, but us for selling her ""this piece of crap"" (by the way, those are sold by third party sellers).

However, the error had not been corrected on the claim. It was the exact same as the original that was denied.

"I don't like the truth, so I'm not gonna give you the information you need to assist me! That will show you!","You guys! I started my first job in a call center yesterday, so i can finally post here!

So, i started to take calls for my countries new (6 month old) Hotline for traveling *INTO* my country with respect to the new corona rules. Not for traveling from my country to another country. Not how to get a visa. Not where you can get a test in the country you're trying to travel from. Not weather you have to wear a mask on the plane. 

Only. For. Traveling. Into. My. Country.

It's a mess, as you can imagine, because rules change daily, sometimes by the hour, the rules are new and confusing, people make up stupid rumors, you know it.

Most people are fine, if not confused, desperate or the connection is garbage. But here comes my first major c***-caller.

Me: me
C: caller /c***
S: supervisor


Me: Hello *Hotline name * how may i help you?

C: I have people coming from several different countries TODAY to participate in a photo shoot. I'm unsure how the rules are for entering the country? Do they need a corona test? 

Me: Thanks for the question. *Explanation:* Weather and how people can enter depends on their citizenship, the country they travel from, and their reason for the visit. 
If your employees /partners have paid work to do in this country, they have a valid reason, but weather they need a recent, valid Corona-test to cross the border depends on the country they travel from. [There are about six countries left in the world that don't require a test, and they are falling like dominoes] 
So, are they foreigners and where do they travel to this country from?

C: They are all foreigners, *lists a few countries where they come from*

Me: A few of these countries will require them to have taken a Covid-test to enter, even if they fulfill the requirement for a valid reason. 

C: But they can't get a test with such short notice! It takes weeks to book a test! They fly in today! I called you a few days ago and asked your colleague, they said they didn't need the test??? 

Me: That's weird. These are basic rules, every one of my colleagues would have told you they need a test. 
When did you call and who did you talk to? 

C: I can't remember who i talked to or when i called. 

Me: Alright, the only solution i can offer you is for your employees to fill out this form that says you promise to take a test immediately and then self-quarantine for 48 hours. 

C: No good! They can't self-quarantine, the photo-shoot is today! 

Me: Then they can't come in. They incriminate themselves if they don't follow the agreement they signed. Now, i think one of the countries you named doesn't require a test, but some of them definitely do. Can you repeat the countries so i can tell you which people can enter? 

C: No, they all need to enter today, there must be a solution! The coworker [who she can't remember] that i talked with a few days ago [she can't remember when] told me they could enter! 

Me: I apologize if we gave you wrong or unclear information, but the rules can not be bent. They need to stay out or quarantine for 48 hours. I'm sorry. One person on your list might be able to enter though, might i get the countries again? 

C: No! There has to be a solution here! I want to talk to someone else! 

Me: I will ask my supervisor. 

*walks over to supervisor*

S: [immediately] Is she muted? 

Me:*mutes her*

S: I'm not gonna talk to her. You need to make clear to her what the rules are. 

Me to c: *explains everything again*

C: *says the same as before*

Me: I really want to help you here. Some of your models might me able to enter without a test. May i have the countries again? 

And now, get this, SHE decides that she is fed up with ME. So she gets snappy in her tone and interrupts me:

C: Maybe you should have written them down, then you wouldn't have to ask all the time!?

Me: You told me the countries once. I don't need the countries. You need the information. I'm trying to help you. 

C: Maybe i don't want to talk to someone who screams at me?????? [i didn't] I want to talk to someone else! 

Finally, my supervisor has mercy with me and takes the phone. Talks extremely calmly for about a minute. Then the call ends.

"We did what she wanted, and we’re still wrong?","Part of my job involves taking escalated calls, so this woman had been on the line with the agent for about 35 minutes and was either not listening or not willing to understand the situation. 

Basically a few years ago she had given us authority to direct debit her bank account for her son’s membership. She’s now calling us to see why a payment she wasn’t expecting came out of her account. The agent explained it to her, but because her son has a separate membership we can only give limited info, only info relating to the payments (because it’s her account, right?) 

Anyway, she comes through to me and I explain what the agent had already explained to her, and the following occurred. 

Customer: but how can you just take my money without telling me? 

Me: I appreciate that it was a few years ago but you did give us authority to do so. We don’t make any changes unless they’re requested, so as you never told us you wanted the payments to stop they’re still going 

C: but I didn’t even get a reminder that it was going to happen 

M: we send a reminder before the yearly payment is due, but it would have been sent to your son as he’s the policy holder and it’s his contact details on file

C: well he moves around a lot so he probably didn’t receive it 

M: okay but it’s his responsibility to tell us if he moves. Besides it was probably sent via email 

C (now getting very aggressive): this is just disgusting that (company) is doing this to me, I’ve been a member for so long and you’re basically stealing my money 

M (also getting frustrated): no, we’re not stealing anything. We’re following your instructions to debit your account. Like I said it was a few years ago that you set this up, but the payments have come out every year at the same time and this is the first time you’ve contacted us about it 

C: there’s no need to raise your voice at me. I’m a loyal member and I think you should reimburse me for these payments 

M: there’s no need for you to raise your voice at me either. And perhaps you can talk to your son about reimbursing you, as it’s his policy that you’re paying for 

She went on to say that she’s going to tell her son to cancel his policy and that she’ll get the money back. I told her he’s more than welcome to call us to cancel and we will happily refund anything that is paid past the cancellation date. 

I removed her bank details from her sons policy and emailed him to let him know he needs to update his payment method.

I fully expect her to make a complaint about me, but I really couldn’t care less. I have no problem dealing with escalations when there’s generally something that has gone wrong or that we as a company have fucked up, but in situations like this I just want to jump down the phone and strangle bitches.",503,0,0

Sigh I am unhelpful.,"So the other day I had this woman call in because she wanted to open an escrow account and it wasn't processing  fast enough for her. And somehow that became my problem.  So she calls in complaining  that she paid  5k into this escrow account was told it would be open in November and that she would get a call back that it was open. Easy enough . I tell her I can assist and she starts getting nasty. She's condescending and asking why she can't see it online if its open.  Why its not updating etc. Its a 45 minute call of me trying to assist. Telling her I cant figure it out.  I cant find a way to tell her her new payment since we have to wait for the system to update.  Etc. Blah blah blah.  Ok she gets mad at me and asks for a supervisor so I do the whole, I'll get one connected it will take some time shit. Ok. So I put her on hold go to my supervisors with my tail between my legs and they get upset and dont want to help surprise surprise... so I go back to tell her and she
Goes you are the most unhelpful customer service representative I have ever had the business of taking to. I want a refund right now. So I go back and tell my boss and my boss said she can do it  cool beans. I tell the customer and she gets pissed off even more. I finally get her over and this lady starts telling my boss I'm unhelpful, and I'm curt, and im rude, and unsympathetic.   She's never met one like me and I'm horrible and I deserve to be fired.

These questions are the absolute worst and at the same time they’re my favorites lol.,"Why did my supplemental life insurance go up by $100 a month?

My thoughts - Because you want someone to win the lottery when you die. 

The truth - You live in America and most people don’t even have supplemental life. 

What I say - Ah I see. That’s definitely frustrating to see such a high price increase. The price increase is either going to be a straight increase from the client or a cost passover from the carrier. 

Customer - So I should call the carrier?

My thoughts - What? You think anyone can change this for you?

What I say - Yeah you can. They may be able to provide more background information as far as what triggered the increase. Would you like their number?

another one.....

How much are my prescriptions going to be.

What I say - It depends on whether they are generic, preferred or non-preferred. 

Customer - Alright I can give you the names and provides all NAME BRAND drugs and they’re taking triplicates of the same drug for the same issue and triplicates of the same medication in different dosages. 

Turns out all the meds are preferred name brand....

Me - That’s $249 for a 3 month supply. And I say that 10 times. 

another one.....

I get a dialog box on the website that says to continue press cancel. THAT SOUNDS WRONG. WHAT SHOULD I DO? Have you heard of this before?

What I say - There’s a lot of different dialog boxes that can show up. According to that, you’re next step is to click cancel. 

Customer - It just sounded wrong hardy har. Doesn’t it sound wrong?

My thoughts - Maybe if your reading comprehension wasn’t so shit you would have a better time.

Then there’s the people who just made decisions that are completely stupid. 

For example, there’s an HMO and a PPO with a $5 difference. I tell them their preferred provider is only in the PPO and reiterate that 5 times in a row but they choose the HMO and then ask if they can still file claims incurred by their out of pocket costs for this HMO plan out of their spending account. 

Sometimes I will explain something completely thoroughly and the customer will make the decision that makes the least sense. I also don’t like it how customers are only okay with you if you do the work of multiple companies and departments. It’s never enough when you work as a call center agent to just do your job. You always just gotta do way more to get by and I think that part is what gets me the most mad.

These jobs always underpay and they work you harder than other higher paying office jobs.

Thankfully my reputation around the office is somehow amazing which has literally never happened but I get the impression that my manager straight up hates my guts.

I gotta add one to this lol. 

Healthcare costs are so high, says a 62 year old woman only paying $200 a month for medical dental and vision. 

me - well you only have a few more years until you’re medical eligible. 

Her - Yeah but the costs are just astronomical. You have to choose between putting food on the table and being covered by medical. 

What I think - You’re not referring to yourself. And the poor don’t have a choice of purchasing medical or food. The choice is automatic and it’s food.

Her - They really should have medicare for all. But I still think employers should have the ability to provide medical but I don’t think they should have to. 

Me - ok woman...... whatever.",5,0,0
"Well, you should ask one of your 15,000 friends.","A few years back, I did warranties for a company that sold high end hiking back packs.
We had a limited lifetime warranty so basically, unless you dropped your bag in a campfire or dirtied it beyond cleaning, you were good to return it for a repair/ replacement. 

 Customer calls me one day and says he fell in a ditch and his bag got wet with gross puddle water and it needs to be exchanged. 
I explain to him that's not under warranty, but that there is specific cleaning product he could use that would disinfect without damaging his bag. 
The man starts getting belligerent, probably because he was expecting a new bag, so I even offer to send him some expensive cleaning product we carry FOC.

He tells me he has nowhere to wash it in as he doesn't want to contaminate his bath or sink.
Although this sounds like nonsense to me, I suggest he uses a plastic bucket or container and do it outside, to which he replies that he doesn't have anything like that. 
I ask him if he has any friends he can borrow a bucket from. 

At this point, customer realizes that he's not getting his way, so he escalates it by saying:
I have 15,000 followers on biking groups and I'm going to share how poorly I was treated. 
You guys are going to lose so many sales!

Otherwise, it's first/last name, DOB, and email on file. This dude wasn't a screen pop. It was hard to drag his info out of it and took a solid to minutes. Rip my AHT.

Mbr: ""I need the full account number. There's only the last four on my paper.""

Me: It dawns on me that he said ""approval letter"". ""It's not going to be in your approval letter, sir. Federal law prohibits any more than four digits. Again, security issue. It will be on the card when you get it.""

Mbr: ""The card wasn't in the letter!""

Me: ""That's just an approval letter. Let me see when it shipped."" USPS has obviously been fucky lately. I've had a few calls. ""Okay, sir. It looks like your card was shipped on the 23rd. It should be there in 7-10 days.""

Mbr: ""Can I get the full account number somewhere else?""

Me: ""If you make an online banking account, yes.""

Mbr: ""Why do I need an online banking account. I just need the number.""

Me: -explains security hazard again and repeats online banking access-

Mbr: ""I need the security code. Is that there? I need to use it now. I only got it to pay a bill tomorrow.""

Me: -cue Bert stare- ""...sir, you can't use the card until you have it in hand and activate it.""

It's just another manic Monday....,"So happy Monday to all. How was your day in the call center? 

Today was beautiful..

I had Mr. ""If I ask enough times this will be faster"" for breakfast in the morning.  3 calls over 2 days ( 1 bus day) for a postal mailed report.  I think next time I shall tell him every time he calls he gets put last in the queue and that the system eliminates duplicates.

And...

For lunch I had Ms. ""I'm trying to make it appear I have less govt benefits in my account.  You must fill my oil tank which you say you wouldn't do back in April bc my vent is broke and oil spilled""

Vents prevent spills  btw.. and well I was the one who spoke to her back on the day of the spill and said we would no longer fill the tank while the vent was broke. 

Today she threatened me with a lawsuit because I couldn't put an order in, she had not fixed the issue. Then 3 times she told me she's part of a huge lawsuit. She's a whistle blower against a restaurant and that she told her lawyer about the vent and he said she doesn't have to fix it before we deliver oil. Even though that has caused a previous oil spill there and why we told her we wouldn't deliver until fixed. 

3 times this story.  The 3rd I went ""Yadda yadda, yes you have a lawyer"" I told her my first name so she could tell her lawyer who obviously isn't needing to put much time in her whistle blower case and also needs to address every single one of her failures while using govt money to pay for home heating oil. But when she asked for every one's name in the office.  I said someone will be in contact with you.  And hung up on her. 

I don't get paid enough for anyone crap.


Edit: Oh and while I was in the phone with a customer, a nearby worker was telling a story across the office about her daughter accidentally plucking the first pubic hair off her own daughter thinking it was a loose dog hair. 

I had to talk to my customer louder so she didn't have to hear the gross stupidity. 

 Then I got scolded for wearing an earpiece (bluetooth) that I always wear to drowned out that employee because somehow hearing a soft buzz across the room is more offensive then loudly talking about adolescent pubic hair plucking. It was alternative music at the time.

SO! Details! 

First off, I'm Filipino, and a woman. And I'm working as a telephone banker for a US bank. So mostly all of my calls are from the US. 

Now a bit of background about myself (this is a bit important, I think) I was a working student back in the past, I worked my ass off to provide for my education AND was still able to give more money to my family. Even as a phone banker, Im still able to provide for myself, my family and live very, VERY comfortably AND I'm already investing for a business that I'm putting up by next year.

To sum that up, Im proud to be an independent and successful woman.

And why dear folks am I bothering you with this info? 

Because this particular interraction with the customer makes me want to choke the living hell out of him for being racist, sexist and for feeling entitled. 

* cue flashback *

(Full disclosure, some parts may have been paraphrased since its been almost four months since this call happened)

Me: Hello! This is RS3197 with ""bank name"", may I have your name please? 

C: Is this a US representative?

Me: Um no sir, I'm part of the Philippine branch. 

C: Oh the Philippines, I love the Phillipines! He didnt sound sarcastic at this)

Me: Oh wow! * laughs, trying to build rapport *

----THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN---

C: You know, you people are nobodies!

Me: * me visibly confused * I'm sorry?

C: You people take jobs from us here in the U.S., You are all just dumb folks in Asia that are only good for nothing! YOU HEAR ME?! There's only one Filipino I know that is good and thats Manny Pacquiao (hes talking about the famous filipino boxer) 

* customer rants about Manny pacquiao for several mins* 

Continued~

C: And you, you think you're so sweet but all you Filipinas do is just lie down on your back when you see a foreigner so they could take you to the states and live a comfortable life. You shouldnt even be doing this job! You just need to find a foreign guy and seduce him to taking you to the US! Thats the only thing you are good for! Nothing else! You people take our jobs here in the States when you shouldnt even be working!

Me: If thats your opinion, sir. I respect that. May I know what can I do for you regarding your account? (Me trying to be calm and continue the call for auditing purposes)

C: What I need you to do, is to remove this goddamn transaction off my credit card! 

Me: I see. The transaction can be removed sir, I'll just have to transfer you over to my colleagues in the dispute department so they can assist you further. 

(I was customer service, removing transactions or charges were a different department's task, so I did have to transfer him even if he wasnt rude)

C: Oh so now you're transferring me to somebody else! Unbelievable! See? You can't do your job! You should quit! No, don't transfer me! Do your job and remove it right now!

(I was already soooo tempted to hang up on him, he's demanding for me to do something when he wasnt even giving me details about his card info so I can see the account, nor the details about the transaction he wants me to remove, and since its a cancelation of a charge which is another department handles, i could just transfer him directly without taking the details since the other dept will just ask it from him again and we wanted to avoid any frustration from the customer about repeating information. 

Me: Sir, I'm afraid I'm not capable of removing your charge. It is going to be something another department has to do. 

C: No! Cancel it right now or else I'll cancel the card! 

(I was thinking at the back of my head that if this guy cancels his relationship with our bank, it would be one less douche that I would need to handle) 

Me: Sir, even if I want to, I can't because I have no access to cancelation. And if I have no access, meaning I. Cant. Cancel. It. Hence why I need to transfer you over to another department who can REMOVE it for you, IF you DONT WANT to be tranferred then THE CHARGE STAYS because I can't remove it. Even. If. I. Wanted. To. So I'll transfer you now. If. Thats. Alright. With. You?

(My tone started to become monotonous there, The caps lock are me emphasizing the words, not screaming)

C: Fine! You can't do your job, then transfer me to someone who can! You're a waste of money and to think you're getting paid just to talk to the phone, put us on hold or transfer us back and forth!

Me: I'll be transferring you now, please stay on the line.

Orig \^\^

Okay so several people asked for an update on this. Not sure if I did this right or not.

Sadly it's not a good update. It's been just over a week and the company I worke for still haven't cancelled their account. I haven't seen anything in terms of news articles/arrest records. If fact, they've actually gotten service twice since then. The main person on the account was the one that placed the calls which is why they weren't caught in time but I've been informed that if they call in again to just leave it alone.

Now I'm sitting here debating on if I should start looking for a new job because obviously money is more important to this company, than the safety of our drivers/us.

If anything else changes I'll make another update but the fact that they haven't cancelled it yet, means they probably won't. I asked about the driver on Friday when I called the garage he works for but they didn't have an update to give me.

"""Then I'll go to another company!""","I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

I'm not very tech savvy when it comes to the automated system. I know it asks you a few simple questions (like the pick up and drop off location, discounts, profile, etc.), but I never learned if it's capable of creating a Reservation for the customer or if the agent needs to finish the process. 

In any case, no system is perfect, there will be times where the information you just provided gets lost and you'll have to start from scratch. Well, this one customer wouldn't accept that...

C: I called your company to make a reservation, the automated system took all my information, then it transferred me to your agent and she asked me for all the information again!

H: I apologize to hear that, sir.

C: Why would you have an automated system ask me all these questions and then transfer me to an agent who doesn't know anything?

H: I wouldn't really have an answer for that, sir.

C: Well, someone must have all the information I provided to the automated system!

At this point the guy is delusional, so I offer him my assistance.

**What's the purpose of the automated system?**

The way I understand it, it's to provide the agents the pick up location, profile (if the customer has one) or customer's name, and discounts. At the very least that's how it worked for me back when I made reservations. I don't know if it's capable to make the entire reservation on its own.",75,0,0
Remote Support From Home. The Worst Three Years of my Life.,"I worked for three years for a tech support company that major office supply chains and a certain cable company used. The worst three years of my life. None of the techs ever got a raise (“The moment we become profitable!”). And I worked from home.

For six months, I had the manager that 90% of the techs hated. He was incredibly controlling and condescending. How horrible? His screen name was Jor-El and, yes, his avatar was Superman. 

We all know the drill: “Um…you’re 2mins late. Was there traffic?”

There was a lot of bullshit with communication. For instance, I’d get an email saying “Log in and do this training. Do not go live until you’ve completed it.” Five minutes into the training I’d get an IM. “Is there a reason you’re not live? You’re logged in and you’re supposed to be live.” I’d reference the email and rather than say something like “there was a miscommunication” or “let me look into that” he’d say “go live now. Immediately.”

Overtime was always an issue. I had no interest in doing it. I’d constantly get messages from other managers saying “HEY! I see your shift is almost over and I have this feeling that you’re looking for over time!” I’d respond “Ohhhhhh…you’re so wrong about that.” 

This led to the single most horrible corp-speak I’ve ever heard. I got called into a voice meeting about my lack of team-playing by not killing myself for no possibility of a raise. 

Jor-El: So, you’re not doing any overtime.

OP: That’s right. 

Jor-El: I need you to start doing overtime.

OP: Well, is overtime mandatory? Are you forcing me to work more hours than I signed up for?

Jor-El: Well………it’s not mandatory but it is required. 

I laughed out loud. 

From that time forward, he had it in for me. I documented every instance where he tried to slam and abuse me. When the dam finally broke I was completely prepared. It was a tense meeting but I kept my cool. The company mediator obviously wasn’t 100% on my side but in the end, I got what I wanted - a tacit admission that he was being an asshole and I got transferred to another team. 

A couple weeks later, I found out that he “wasn’t working there anymore.” I couldn’t get any of the details but the small bits I was told seemed to indicate that I was not the only one. 

Bonus convo with another manager during an eval:

Manager: So, your customer interface is really great. You listen. You’re polite. You put them at ease and your conflict de-escalation is great. So I’m going to give you a 3 out of 5.

Me: WHUH??

Manager: Yeah, I know. But management won’t let us give a cumulative score higher than 3.2. 

Epilogue: After another miserable conflict with mgmt, I talked about it with my wife and just quit. No notice. About a month later, I get a package from them.

Customer wants me to be a mind reader.,"I just had this call that honestly made me want scream and slam my head in the keyboard.

Background: I work for a fairly large bank in the Small Business dept. I take inbound calls from customers all day. Of course, it’s mostly small business owners - but the occasional personal customer can slip through depending on the options they select through the automated system.

I had an older gentleman call on his personal account today. He had a fairly decent balance and a lot of investments in my bank. He made sure to state that several times. Okay sir, that’s great, but how can I help you today?

“Well my accountant was going through my books and says I made a payment to the IRS for about $400. That shouldn’t be. I need to dispute that.”

Me: Okay, happy to help. What’s the date and exact dollar amount so I can dispute?

Him: Idk my account just said an IRS payment for about $400. Can you just look or can you get someone who knows what they’re doing?

I HATE when customers say some shit like this. Don’t demean me by saying I don’t know what I’m doing because YOU are too lazy to look at your account to tell me what I’m filing this freaking dispute on.

He flat out refused to tell me. I suggested maybe he should call his accountant back for more info. Nope. Kept asking me to “just use my eyes and look for it!”

I read out over a dozen transactions with a similar dollar amount (not labeled from the IRS mind you). None of them he said was it. Still keeping my sweet customer service voice, I finally explained I can’t file a dispute on a claim if I don’t know what I’m filing it on.

Customer: Oh don’t give me that crap! Get me your freaking supervisor, you don’t know what your doing!

Me: please hold for a few minutes while I connect you..

Get on the line with my supervisor, explain the reason for the escalation. She just goes “well I’m gonna tell him the same thing so bring him on through.”

You’re stupid and your husband sucks,"Mobile.

I’m about 5 months into this call center job and still struggling with my call time. I only need to shave, hmm, about 70 seconds off my average. Really trying to control the call, blah blah, blah. So I worked some OT today and was doing really well with call times. Until my last call. 


I took a call from a lady whose general nationality lends to having shrill voices that go about 90 miles a minute. She ordered an appliance and it had been canceled by the store.  Thus, a credit for that amount has been placed on her account. We sent her a letter about how she didn’t have to include that amount.

What followed next was me explaining in 14 different ways that the credit had been subtracted from the statement balance and the charges on account added for a total. Basically 5 numbers, addition and subtraction. And I’m looking at the timer on my desktop and silently dying inside knowing this call would kill my call time. 

The second worst part was her husband getting on the phone to repeat back to me what I said. The wife then says to me, “Yeah, my husband wouldn’t explain it to me and said to call you.”

I get why he wouldn’t even try because the wife is apparently unable to grasp addition and subtraction. And he sounded like a middle-aged white guy who married this woman because she is of the nationality that is prized for their petite ness. In my mind I was like, “I hope she’s beautiful because she is dammmmmmm stupid.”

I was soooo frustrated.",24,0,0
I Love Our Older Generation,"  

I have posted about an older repeat caller before, I have not heard from her in a while, but the pandemic has brought out some lonely hearts tired of having no one to talk with her. As I wind down my call center career, since I finally got a non-call center job, I treasure these wholesome diversions to getting yelled at about Lysol Wipes in my preferred field. 

\*I am still on this call while writing this, but this is not she said, I said type of convo since I haven’t said much. 

📷 The call started with her asking if I needed any recipes from her Greek Cookbook that she translated into English. 

📷 I have the same name as her EXDIL, almost Miss Illinois, but divorced her son and took him for $50k; she thinks this woman was a secret lawyer because she knew what she was doing. 

📷 Descriptions of the birth of each of her children. 

📷 Her work history

📷 How she came here from Greece

📷 Her parents, and other family histories. 

📷 13 minutes into the call, she is has given me 3 recipes, even though I told her 3x that I didn’t need them. 

📷 Double checked that I was a Miss and was never married, and then said that means I am a virgin (LOL!!) and would need to know the info about childbirth when I snag a husband (I am not really attracted to men).

📷 Another recipe, Halva, this time. 

📷 She talked about her husband but didn’t sound like she was too fond of him. 

📷 More info on her son and the young lade he is dating, who already has a kid, so must immoral. 

📷 In detail, her church history (not sure of what she said, I tend to zone out when it comes to religion). 

📷 The call is still happening, but she is on a recipe loop, 4th recipe for Halva. 

📷 I have several times tried to steer to what she wanted from me, but I am pretty sure at this point, she is just lonely and longs to hear another human voice. It is these calls that I will miss when I am gone. I have a fondness for older, hell my current partner is 55, which is young for me. I will be on this one for a while, but she is on a loop right now.

Too Much in the Background,"This is my first ever post on Reddit, so please bare with me. TL:DR at bottom

I worked at a call center for 4 years. For the most part all was fine. I eventually moved to the data entry section, but would jump on calls when necessary. Now on to my tale...

A bit of back story, I worked in one of many departments in the center handling a litany of different programs. I did rather well. Some good days, some bad. One of the programs I was working was a call-in recertification for a free wireless phone service provided through the government. In order to qualify for the service you had to be participating in some form of welfare program (food stamps, Medicaid, etc) or have a low enough income. Since this was a recertification we didn't require proof on this program, so we could process over the phone. 

Once we went through the necessary identifying information, we were required to read through the rules and have the caller agree or disagree to the statements. If they disagreed to any one of them, the recert  was ended and denied. One of the statements they had to agree to was something like ""false statements...punishable by law."" Most of the time all went well...until one day when I was talking with this sweet old woman.

I got through all the necessary information and had started on the statements, when I noticed that two of my coworkers behind me were discussing the death of a family member to one of them. This is where things turned bad. I told this poor, sweet, innocent, old lady that if she lied on her certification that it was ""punishable by death."" My coworkers' conversation went in my ear and out my mouth to this woman.

I quickly corrected the mistake and she started laughing hysterically over the phone. I held it in until the call was over. I quickly put myself into ""away from desk"" and went to my supervisor and then the head of the department.  An hour later the head of the department came to my desk laughing and told me she listened to the call a few times. It made her day.

TL:DR I told an old lady on the phone that lying on her recertification was punishable by death. Boss got a good laugh.",417,0,0

How to turn a $3 parking rate into an arrest.,"So, this is a crazy one folks. My job is to answer the phone for people needing help exiting my companies garages at a university on the normally quiet 3rd shift. 

Around 12:30am, I get a call from a lady

&gt;Lady: ""I paid, but the gate won't go up to let me out""

I check our system and see no charge processed at the gate she is calling from. I inform her of this, and she insists up and down that she paid. So, with nothing I can really do for her, I send out my one field guy to talk to her. I hear nothing for 30 minutes, and figure it was dealt with, until he calls me on the radio.

&gt;Field Guy: ""Uhh, dispatch, she has taken the plates off of her vehicle and I think she's going to run though the gate, can you call University PD?

So, shit just got interesting, and I call PD and send them that way. Its all quiet, for the next hour and a half, just getting updates that the police are still talking to the woman, until I get the final call. 

&gt;Field Guy: ""Dispatch, she is being arrested. Her grandfather is taking the car now, so we don't need to call a tow truck""

I contain my curiosity, and tell him to come to the office for an incident report where I can get the juicy details. 

So, I present for you, the juicy details.

She started her whole spiel of paying to the field guy, but couldn't show any proof. She was asked when she came in and how much she paid. The rate she claims she paid and the time she came in don't match up, so that's strike one. She then changed her story to her mom paid for her. Mom was nowhere to be seen and couldn't be contacted by the driver. Strike two. 

She leaves the gate, and parks in the garage, and the field guy hangs out until she comes back to the gate. Once she is there again, he offers to fill out a form that will let her pay later, or even dispute the charge if she wanted too. That was denied, and she began face timing some guy. Said guy told her to take the plates off of her car, which was when PD was sent.

Once there, the cops began trying to work with her to get her gone, and she kept on refusing and refusing. So the cops get to the point where they ask her for ID...she doesn't have one. Cops ask her if she just forgot it at home.

&gt;Her: ""No, I don't have  license."" 

Yup, she admitted to police that she was driving without a license. Her excuse was that ""The judge told her she could drive"" Which...is not really how that works. Police continue talking to her and trying to resolve this and get her gone, when the guy she was face timing pulls up, gets out, sees cops, than drives away and parks down the street to watch. During this, the field guy watches as she hands her unpaid, supposedly already used parking ticket to an officer, thus turning her whole original story into a lie. 

Cops are getting more and more frustrated with her being completely uncooperative, and when they ask her for her permission to drive the vehicle out of the gate so someone can pick it up, she gets really defensive and weird about it. 

It is unknown who saw what or who told who what, but PD opened her passenger door, and pulled a gun out of the car. My field guy was in his vehicleat this point,  simply watching with his windows up. He rolled his windows down as the lady got on the phone. On the phone, on speaker, was her lawyer, who told her and the cops, in no uncertain terms, that she was not legally allowed to be in possession of a firearm. Her excuse? ""The sheriff said I was allowed to have that"" Nah honey, he didn't. 

Despite all of this, the police were still simply willing to let her go, and impound the vehicle and seize the firearm. You think she would take this, but nope. She was asked for over 30 minutes if her ride was anywhere close, and she refused to answer every time until the police just arrested her. At which point, the face time guy drives off.

So, instead of paying the 3 bucks or taking any of the other literal get out of jail cards, she wasted 2 hours of everyone's time, and is now looking at a $1000 fine for driving without a license, and up to 5 years in prison for the firearm possession.",1546,0,0
Download Google Photos...,"This is a funny story for once. Usually stories are terrible experiences but this one was pretty fun. 

Little background, I worked in tech support for cell phones and a lot of it spent transferring photos and such from broken/lost devices so a lot of it deals with various cloud services. 

I'll spare you the details of activating the phone and other things and get to the funny part. 

Me: Alright, well we got the phone activated, since you don't have the old phone, do you have anything that backed up your photos?

Customer: I might have had Google Photos downloaded, I'll try that.

Keep in mind, I'm also logged into his phone so I can see everything on his screen (I don't remember why I logged in since this was 3 years ago.) 

Customer: Okay cool, I got logged in and it looks like all my photos are there... except there's some extra ones... I don't know who this guy is.

Me:  ....You said your old phone was stolen right? And you have no idea who this guy is in these selfies 

Customer: Correct.

Me: ... Uhh, I'm willing to bet that this is the guy who stole your phone. He's been taking selfies and Google Photos has been updating it to the cloud on the fly. 

Customer: Well that's super helpful. I'll save these and turn it over to the police.




So the lesson to be learned, download Google Photos. You have tons of backup storage for free and if your phone is stolen there's the possibility the thief is dumb enough to take selfies with your phone that you can access later on.",54,0,0

Don't Ask Questions If You Don't Want the Answer to Them,"Helen is one of the first calls I received. Barely after I finish my opening, she asks for my name again and asks me to spell that out. Already a sign this was not going to be a pleasant call.

She immediately launches into a story about how a company did not deliver all of her order and that they were saying it was out of stock. Instead of giving her a refund, they offer a choice to order something else that was in stock or to wait for her order. Understandably, Helen doesn't accept that and that's why she's calling us to dispute the charge.

I advised her the standard, ""We recommend contacting the merchant first to resolve the issue as it can result in quicker assistance"" and she interrupts me several times by saying she did. Okay, fine. I tell her that a dispute can be setup if she is not able to get this matter resolved directly with the merchant but that we would need additional information from her. She asks what the downsides of opening a dispute would be. I said it can take several weeks to investigate and it could affect her relationship with the merchant.

I must've said something wrong because she starts pushing more questions and seemed somewhat offended with me. One of the last questions she asked me was whether a merchant could take back a credit from us. I told her the truth: Merchants have the right to respond to a dispute and can provide supporting documentation in their defense .

Helen does a 180 on me and immediately asks for a supervisor. I start saying that I would check and she cuts me off and says ""What? WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?"" and I repeat myself. With her change in tone, I apologize to her and she just scoffs and says, ""I'm just trying to give you feedback to improve your customer service because I've been with you for a long time and I've never had anybody speak to me like you did"". She then demands my employee information and I said I would provide it to her and asked if I could place her on a brief hold to check with a supervisor.

Helen: So you can hang up on me??

Me: No, I wasn't going to hang up on you. I was just asking to place you on a brief hold to see if my supervisor is available.

Helen: I want your ID first.

Me: Yes it's 123456. Miss Helen, I do apologize, I was only trying to assist you. I didn't mean to upset you.

Helen: I know, but if you want some advice from me (I didn't), you shouldn't say something like that. That's not good customer service and I know customer service.

Me: I'd be more happy to assist with setting up the dispute still if-

Helen: I don't want your help, GET ME YOUR SUPERVISOR

I apologized and repeatedly told her I'd be more than happy to assist her with her dispute but she wasn't having it. I told her I could arrange for a callback from a supervisor and she said she would call back and talk to somebody else and hangs up. When I accessed her account later to leave a note, I noticed she never called back. She's not the worst person I dealt with but I was shocked at how a call that seemed like it was going to be fine escalated so quickly. I did notice she had said ""she wanted a refund"" rather than ""I'd like to dispute"" early in the call and it's possible she was expecting us to credit her back rather than dispute.",250,0,0

Clean up your dog caca and then maybe your install will be completed.,"This is my first time posting here so go easy on me. I work for a cable company that provides internet and phone. Guess who lol. I am the next thing to a supervisor so I handle frontline escalations and overrides on a daily. An agent calls our escalation line stating a customer is upset because the tech did not install their two new cable boxes and told them they should use Roku devices instead. Ok... que me reviewing the notes and recent work orders on the account. The tech marked the order resolution as complete due to unsafe conditions. The notes state he called his supervisor who then called dispatch stating there was feces in the basement and tech could not complete the job until it was cleaned up. I got my giggles out and prepared to take the call. 

The customer begins by saying how frustrated he is and how he is going to a competitor blah blah blah. I listen without interruption. I state the reason the tech left due to caca in the area where he needs to make the connections in the basement. This mans rebuttal is that the dookie was nowhere near where he needed to make the connections. I had to mute myself there to find an appropriate statement without hurting his feelings. I said sir some people can not tolerate certain smells of that nature and round it out with asking if the basement was clean and we could reschedule the appointment. He then says his wife was busy with his niece all morning and didn’t have a chance to clean the area before the tech came. In my mind I’m like who the hell lets their animal crap in their friggin basement for Christ sake!!! Take them outside. I hear the wife in the background like it wasn’t even our dogs that made the mess... so wait your neighbor who shares the space allows them to crap there too. What is wrong with you people.

Then the customer goes that’s not even the main issue. The tech tells me when he gets inside that it’s stupid of him to use cable boxes and to use a roku device they are way better and save you money. In my head that translates to your house stinks and I don’t want to be here lol. He then asks if he should just go to another service provider and of course I reply that is your decision sir you are not in a contract. He asks to speak with someone above me and calls me a cunt while speaking to his wife. I checked the account later in the day and there was no appointment rescheduled so I am guessing they called the competitor. I still can’t get over the fact that they think it’s ok for their dog to poo poo in the basement... disgusting lol",41,0,0

In calls Galaxy phone Karen to ruin my day (and my utilization stats)

We’ve got a 2 factor id system for logging in to try and help stop fraudsters. This requires either receiving a phone call or a text with a secure code before you can access things if our system doesn’t recognize the device you’re on. 

Well, Galaxy Karen gets the code and then it makes her log in all over again, in an endless loop of fuckery.

I realize she’s got a second phone (one she’s logging into and a different one she’s calling me on) so I offer to add her other phone in so she can get the code on that, and avoid the stupid loop.

She doesn’t know how to minimize the call she’s currently on and won’t accept a call back if we get disconnected. Fair enough.

I ring up our tier 2 line and see if they’ve got suggestions. I get a couple of things and go back to her, trying to troubleshoot what she’s doing wrong.

“IT’S NOT MY GODDAMN PHONE ITS YOUR STUPID SYSTEM. WHAT IS SO DIFFICULT ABOUT JUST UNLOCKING MEEEEE?!”

She bellows at me. I pinch the bridge of my nose and explain that I’m trying to help her minimize her app so she can flip between that and her text messages and not have to log in all over again.

lol nope. 

“YOU NEED TO GET ME TO SOMEONE THAT KNOWS TECHNOLOGY BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY DON’T. WHAT THE HELL DO YOU EVEN HAVE A JOB FOR?! GET ME TO SOMEONE WHO ISNT USELESS!” 

I put her on hold without even asking, because once I go back to my tier 2 angel, I completely lose it and start bawling. I explain what happened and give her the customers information so she can take over the call.

I go to take a break for a bit to chill out, my tier 2 angel tells me she told Galaxy Karen the exact same thing and got her figured out. After a few swear words from Galaxy Karen of course.

Not your usual customer service,"So I work for a company that basically sends out medical aids. I specifically work in a department that gives people medical aids out of their insurance. To do my job I need to sort of make prescriptions for the medical aids. Some people need beds to die in a some just need some aids to help them get around and others have life long disabilities. I need to know the law, the aids and be able to write these prescriptions. As you might expect this means that I can see a lot of personal information, just like a select few coworkers. This however isn't the case for most people working in the company.

Even tho' you can keep the aids for 6 months untill you need to ask for them at your local government institute, we send out letters at 2 months of use, because the government can be terribly slow. Most people however don't need more than 6 months of use and this often leads to calls, because the letters are standardized. Again... we can't make a distinction between medical needs, because this is very private information. 

This also leads to some weird notes from and to coworkers. You can't say ""Bob isn't able to get out of his bathtub due to weak muscles, and therefore the current medical aid is is insufficient and we need to replace it with this medical aid.""  But we can say ""Medical aid 1 isn't working, get medical aid 2"" There is absolutly no one who can question any decision I make.

Ok... back to the topic. Today I got a lady that was absolutly appalled that we send her a letter. I explained to her that even tho' she doesn't have a need to use them for more than 6 months, there are plenty people who do. To make sure that people don't pay for their own medical aid (they are extremly expensive) we send out these letters. ""OK BUT I FIND IT APPALING THAT I GOT THIS LETTER, IT WASNT MEANT FOR ME."" ""Madam, we can't make that destinction to protect your and others privacy."" She said she understood, but immediately went back to ""Well, ok you're a weird company and I still find it absolutly crazy that you send me a letter that wasn't meant for me."" I have absolutly no time for this bullshit, when people are in need of a bed, because they are quite literally dieing. I told her the information she needed regarding her medical aid and even extended the period she could rent one of her medical aids (that wasn't covered by insurance) free of charge. Because you know... sometimes we do and we understand that some people need help. Even after all of that she was still mad an basically calling us horrible for sending that letter. So I did what I usually do. Ramble all the specifications and information she needed in one big breath and then said ""Do you have anymore questions?"" She stuttered a no. ""No?"" ""Allright then I wish you very well. Have a nice day."" Ofcourse people can't resist to say ""Goodbye."" I mute my phone and go on with my day. Not much of a spectacle, but still needed to get it of my chest.

Here are the basics for anybody who wants to get a medidal aid at expense of insurance:
1. You are not the customer. Your insurance is.
2. I am not going to tell you how sick you need to be in order to get an aid. You tell me.
3. You can call you insurance, and they will do... absolutly nothing. 
4. You don't get the aid while you don't need them, you don't get a speciality bed because you like the convenience. Youre only taking away a bed from somebody who's really in need if you do.
5. All people trained to do medical prescriptions can see eachothers notes. Calling back doesn't work, if you don't have new information that will qualify you for the aid.",51,0,0

"So you're capable of talking to us like we're actual human beings, you're just choosing to act like a lunatic because you can. Cool.","We sell and support a CRM (Customer Resource Management) software. Basically means that our clients use our software to work with their customers. So for troubleshooting purposes, we of course as tech support have the ability to log in as that client and look at any activities they've done in their live environment. This includes conversations within the system between them and their customers.

We have one lady who, whenever she calls in, probably articulates worse than a child raised by wolves. She gets worked up over very minor issues, usually user error, and gets more frustrated the more you try to figure out what the hell she's talking about. 

Her email tickets are even worse. ""HELP LOG IN MEMAIL CLIENTS BLOCKED WTF"". ""REPORTS BROKEN CAN'T READ UNACCEPTABLE CALL NOW."" 

If you try to probe her for more information, she claims you aren't ""reading her emails"" and demands to speak with someone else. If you're on a call with her and try to probe for more info, she says you aren't listening and you have to fight with her to get anything out of her to use for troubleshooting. Thankfully, she doesn't call in very often at all.

But if you're trying to troubleshoot, and happen to go into her account to see/listen to the conversations she has with her own customers....she's very polite, clear, concise, and friendly. She just reserves the fragmented Caveman Karen speech for us unworthy plebs.

The most awkward customer question ever,"I work in a job that is a mix of tech support and customer service. We provide both phone and chat support to our clients. My company is very customer-focused and they allow us to make small talk with the client as long as it doesn't take us away from helping them, or other clients, and not to be excessive.

This happened a few years ago, so I don't remember the exact details of why the client contacted us, but I know it was a fairly complicated issue that included the use of screen sharing and I had to get our lead support rep involved as well as a developer to fix his issue. This was handled through our chat support line and as the client was in India, and speaking Hindi, I was using our chat's translate feature to communicate with the client.

What sticks with me to this day, and why I'm here dear friends is for what ensued after the issue was fixed.

Me: Obviously Me  
DMC: The Client

Me: Is there was anything else I could help with today?

DMC: M or F

Me: I'm female. Yourself?

DMC: Male. Are you Married or Single?

Me: I'm married. We just celebrated our 19th wedding anniversary last month.

DMC: Are you a virgin?

Me: Excuse me, I don't believe that translated correctly, Can you retype the question?

DMC: Are you a virgin? Like never had sex?

Me: I've been married for 19 years. Do you have any other questions I can help you with regarding \*Insert software name\*?

DMC: No, but if you have any single female friends who are a virgin and wish to get married and move to India, please give them my email address. They must be virgin though. No sex ever. Have a good day.

Call Centre ‘Nam Flashbacks,"I have since left my last job for multiple reasons, but I figured to share one last juicy story of how my last day of the job went.

So to preface it, I was working for a video game console company. I shall leave it to your imagination to figure out which one, and will neither confirm or deny it.

I will however say, that to whoever called me that day, which I will call Angry Australian Man-child (AAM) thanks for the mental trauma...

So, on to the story. It’s the last call of my last day at work, I do my usual “Thanks for calling us, how can I help you today?”

The call came through to our console support line and Angry Australian Man-child is on the other end of the line. He has an issue with his console. It’s a common issue, they accidentally knocked their power cord, corrupted their hard drive, and the console is in safe mode, needing a software installation file.

Now, normal people, at the very least, have a computer or laptop for everyday use. One simply needs to go to our website and download the right file from said site, put it into a flash stick of decent size, and simply plug it in and follow the prompts.

But not Mr. Man-child, oh no, he bragged like an arrogant fanboy about “not having a computer because our console was all he needed as it’s the best”.

Whilst I thanked him for the compliment, this unfortunately made support for him that much more difficult. This was especially the case with the current situations going on.

So, after taking down his details to log his call and incident, I asked politely, “Okay, well....do you have any neighbours or friends that you could borrow a computer or laptop device?”

To this Mr. Man-child said no. Figures.

The next solution that I asked was, “Right...Do you have access to a Public Library of any sort? They most likely have computers you can use.”

Mr. Man-Child did hint likely of this, so that was one option to utilise, and for me an out at least.

Last question I asked was, “Okay, that’s one avenue we can proceed with. The alternative is if you have a smart device, do you use an Android or Apple Device?”

Thankfully, Mr. Man-Child said Android.

With this I had his solution plan laid out for him,” Okay, here is what I can do for you, I will be sending you an email to your contact email with instructions. It’s very important you have access to a computer and flash drive to do this, sir. 

Alternatively, you can use your mobile phone to download the file, but you will need a special cable to transfer the file and format the flash drive to the right settings.

Once you follow those instructions, to the letter, you should be able to have your console back up and run-“

To this, Mr. Man-Child decided to interject and ask, “So you’re saying my console is broken?”

Confused as to why he asked that, I politely reiterated that his console wasn’t broken, namely that it’s in safe mode needing the software to be installed on it. I explained to him a PC analogy of BIOS screen if one’s operating system is corrupted or non existent.

This however didn’t deter Mr. Man-Child to make a wild assumption, “So that means my console won’t be fixed?! That means it’s useless! I spent a lot of money on this console!”

I reiterated, “Sir, your console just needs a software installation. I have explained how it can be fixed, you just need a computer and flash drive, okay?”

Next thing I hear is Mr. Man-Child, after a brief pause, starting to smash his console, cursing and yelling up a storm.

I had to cut the call at the point, I wasn’t paid to take his abuse.

But at least now he can say his console is broken, and if he calls support again, I’d love to see him try to explain why his out of warranty fee should be waived.",469,0,0

Member drives over our drivers arm and then flees the scene,"[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/jhrkam/update_member_drives_over_our_drivers_arm_and/)

So some background info. I work in emergency roadside assistance (ERS) as a dispatcher (DI). Night shift doesn't always have a supervisor and last night was one of those nights which is why we found out about this right way. The DI from 3rd shift immediately messaged our supervisor when she got in around 6:30am. This happened at 4am last night.

So like I just said, we got a call around 4am last night for a vehicle the had no keys. The driver goes out and arrives on location but the customer wasn't there yet. So while he was waiting for the customer to arrive, he starts loading the vehicle up. Well the customer arrives and she and (We're assuming it's her husband/boyfriend) jump out and tell the driver they no longer need service.

So the driver says okay just let me get it unhooked. Instead of the member waiting for him to finish, they jump in the vehicle while it was still on the back of his truck. (This is a big no no) As he's removing the last chain, the member starts the car and throws the vehicle in reverse and guns the vehicle off the back of the truck and RUN OVER THE ARM OF THE DRIVER IN THE PROCESS.

Now, most people would immediately stop and offer to call an ambulance or to at least check on the driver but nope. They took off. The driver ends up call us and (understandably) was screaming and crying from the pain. The DI that got his call ended up calling an ambulance for him but did lose connection with him and he didn't answer when she called him back. She ended up calling the owner of the company he worked for (we call them garages) to let them know what happened.

My supervisor did call the owner herself as well and thankfully the driver is doing okay. They're talking to the member now and will be filing a police report. I just want to know what was going through the members head because I'm pretty sure that if you didn't FEEL it when you ran over his arm that you would have figured it out by the drivers screams. Their accounts been sent to our critical incident team for review and I told my supervisor that if they don't lose their membership after this, that I will lose all faith in the company going forward. Because they could have killed the driver.",980,0,0
The one answer that NOBODY ever understood.,"Ok, so this story is about my time with a life insurance company. There was one question/request I received basically every single day. and not a single person ever came remotely close to understanding the answer. Maybe you can tell me why?

Background: There's two basic types of insurance companies in one sense, mutual companies (policyholders co-own the company) or stock companies (people that own shares of stock own that much of the company).  If you start as a mutual, and convert to a stock company, you have to give your existing policyholders an appropriate amount of stock in the company so they keep their ownership.  This happened maybe 15 years before I started working there, so plenty of people got some stock this way.  That part can be a little confusing, but it's not vital to know either for this story. What you need to know, is they possess a stock certificate in our company. Go.

Every single day, I got a call that went like this:

""Hi, I have this stock in your company, and I want to trade it in for cash.""

*""Ok, well you got that from (explains process above in layman's terms), and now it's just like any regular stock, you buy, sell, trade stock just like you would any other stock you own or have in your portfolio, but you can't call the company and trade it for cash.""*

""No, you don't understand, you sent me this stock years ago, but I don't want it anymore, I just want to get a check for what it's worth!""

*""Oh, I understand, but selling stock is done through a stockbroker, or bank, or financial institution, or probably many more other ways, but you can't just redeem it through customer service, for us or any other company.""*

""So you're refusing to give me the money for my stock?""

*""No... I'm telling you that stock doesn't work this way.  If you owned Wal-Mart stock, you can't just take it to the customer service desk for cash.  This is the same. If you have any investments, or know where you'd go if you wanted to make some, probably your bank, go to that same person for this. If they can't help you for some reason, they'll know exactly where to send you.""*

""So this is just worthless, that's what you're telling me?""

*""No, just, if you don't have anyone you trade stocks with already, call your bank, I'm sure they'll be happy to tell you what your options are.""*

""The bank didn't give this to me, you did!  Let me talk to your manager!""

I understand for some people, this might be the only stock they owned, and were unsure at first, but I think the explanation works?  Also, I talked to plenty of people paying thousands of dollars a month for multi-million dollar policies, I can't believe that not a single one of them has a portfolio or financial guy at their bank or SOMETHING.  But every single time a call started with stock, it ended with bafflement.",56,0,0

"""We already had this conversation yesterday""","I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

Some people can't take no for an answer. I received this customer last monday. She was flying to day to Lynchburg, VA. Problem was that at the time of her arrival (1900), the rental car facility would be closed. Unhappy with the regular agent's response, she demanded to escalate the call.

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C: Customer
C2: Customer 2

H: I do apologize ma'am, but the location would be closed by then

C: Can you call the location and tell them to wait for me? 

H: No ma'am, I wouldn't be able to get in contact with them

C: But why would they close the location if flights are still coming? 

I shrugged.

H: I wouldn't have an answer. It's unfortunate to say the least, I'm sorry for the inconvenience

The customer finally loses it.

C: What is your name? What is your name?

H: HenriquesDumbCousin

C: I'm going to write your name, let me grab something to write...

H: HenriquesDumbCousin

C: Okay, what is your name?

**sigh**

H: HenriquesDumbCousin

C: And what's your last name HenriquesDumbCousin

H: I do apologize but I can't share that information.

C: Why not?

H: For security reasons, of course.

C: Pffft, that sounds pretty convenient, don't you think HenriquesDumbCousin?

H: I'm just telling you the policies, ma'am

C: Your company is such a joke, you're such...

*Click*

H: ... bitch

Entitlement and irrational anger, my favorite combination. Thankfully the call was brief.

She called again the next day. Apparently her daughter was already at Lynchburg, VA, but due to her age there would be underage fees if she rented the vehicle. 

C: I want my daughter to pick up the rental, but I was wondering if at the time of pick up they can change the name on the rental to mine to avoid the underage fees

H: No, that wouldn't be possible

C: WHY NOT?

H: It's not possible to change the renter's name in the middle of the rental 

C: What is your last name HenriquesDumbCousin?

H: We already had this conversation yesterday, ma'am...

C: I knew it was you!

H: This reservation is not going to work

C: What is your...

H: HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAY!

*Click*

I was immediately reminded of this other customer I had back on September. Her reservation was both pick up and drop off at LGB (Long Beach Airport). Problem was that her return flight was at SFO (San Francisco Airport). When she tried to modify the reservation, it wasn't possible.

C2: But you have cars available at Long Beach, you just told me

H: Yes, but they only have vehicles for round trips, they won't allow you to take the vehicle to San Francisco

C2: Why not?

H: Well, speculation from my end, but I suppose they don't have enough vehicles in their fleet, they can't afford to lose one, then again, it's just speculation from my end

C2: Can't you fix it?

H: No

C2: This is such poor customer service. I work for customer service, you know, **and I always go the extra mile to help my customers**. I would call the location and tell them to make it possible

At this point I had the same expression Jack Sparrow did in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, specifically when the stone-crab thingies start to move the Black Pearl through the desert.

H: Yeah... I can't do that

And that's the thing, they refuse to accept the reality that it's not possible to fulfill their requests. They have no problem pointing fingers at me, it's my fault for ""not going the extra mile"". Yeah, fuck them.

**FAQ**

**What to do in a situation like this?**

It is possible to submit a request for an agent to wait for a customer after hours. Needs to be done with at least 72 hours in advance and the customer must provide the arrival flight.

Please be aware that it's a request, not a guarantee that someone will wait for the customer after the location closes. So even if she calls with 72 hours in advance, the request can be declined. Still, I would have offered this option if it wasn't her poor response to the situation.

**What happens if my flight is delayed and I arrive after the location closes?**

Chances are that the agents at the counter will leave, and the only options will be to either reschedule the reservation for the next day or cancel it and get a full refund. It's definitely unfortunate, but there's nothing an agent in a call center can do about it.

**Wow you're a piece. They arent cussing at you. Fucking bullshit**

Make it quick!,"I work as a technical support/escalated call handler for an insurance call center. I work a late night shift. Most of my calls are helping reps navigate the ins and outs of various insurance contracts. One of my many duties of this job is understanding underwriting criteria and explaining it to others, including customers when they request to hear my lovely voice. As a result, I oftentimes deliver bad news. This call was definitely not an exception.

As insurance is regulated on a state level, something that can pass muster in one state may not cut it in another state. If we find that your policy is written for State X, but you and your insured item live in State Y, we will make you rewrite for your new state. If you don't rewrite, we'll nonrenew your policy.

Cast of Characters: Me, Enraged Customer (EC), and Rep

Me: Customer Support Line, this is mentalgopher, how may I help you today?

Rep: You see Enraged Customer's policy coming up?

Me: Yeah, what's wrong?

Rep: He's mad because it ended last week and he can't renew it. He wants to speak with a supervisor about it.

Me: Send him through.

(Rep breathes a sigh of relief and transfers the caller to me.)

Me: Hi, my name is mentalgopher. Am I speaking with Enraged Customer?

EC: Yeah, you f\*\*kin' @$$holes cancelled my f\*\*kin' policy without tellin' me.

Me (Reviewing notes): Well, sir, we have you living in State Y, correct?

EC: Yeah I moved, but that's got f\*\*kin' nothin' to do with nothin'.

Me: Well, your policy is written for State X, so it has everything to do with everything. Did you check your emails for these notices sent on dates A, B, C, and D reminding you that this policy was not renewing?

EC: I didn't get no f\*\*kin' emails.

Me: Okay, but you quoted a new policy for State Y about three weeks prior to the first notice being emailed. We also mailed you notifications via USPS.

EC: You gonna f\*\*kin' fix my policy or what?

Me: Well, you're gonna have to write a new policy for State Y.

EC: Listen, I gotta f\*\*kin' give Lyft proof of insurance or I'll get dropped. Can we make this f\*\*kin' quick?

To EC's credit, his nonrenewed personal auto policy had the endorsement for driving this vehicle for a Transportation Network Company (TNC). However, not all states allow all insurers to have the TNC endorsement on a personal auto policy. So we would usually refer EC to our commercial auto division for a livery policy (fancy word for taxis). But this insurer isn't necessarily able to write a livery policy in all states. EC was living in state Y, which not only does NOT allow for TNC endorsements on a personal auto policy with this insurer, but also does not allow our commercial division to write livery policies.

Me: Yes. As you've told me on a recorded line that you drive for Lyft, we can NOT offer a personal auto policy for you in State Y. Normally, I'd refer you to our commercial division. However, we don't write the alternative policy type we normally offer to customers in your situation in State Y, either. You'll need to seek insurance elsewhere.

EC then proceeds to go on a rant about how every insurance company is comprised of communists, we're out to get him and screw over the little guy. He does it for almost seven straight minutes without taking a breath or giving any room for me to cut in. Then he stops and realizes what he's done.

EC: I told you to make it f\*\*kin' quick!

Me: I did. I told you no and why it wasn't happening. Did you have any other questions?

EC: Don't take up so much of my valuable time! \*click\*

TL;DR- Guy is upset we cut off service based on moving outside of the service area. He wanted his problem fixed stat. I explain why it couldn't be done. Guy yells for prolonged period, then lectures me about wasting his time. ",51,0,0

insert 20 minutes of going around in this circle, with lots of literal non response to words I said, before she requests a translator.

Turns out she was trying to place an international call that she interpreted as not going through. It took 40 minutes of back and forth between the three of us for her to convey to that she was able to call a number and reach her person in another country just the day before, and when she tried to day it rang but no one answered. It took 20 minutes for her to understand this.

In other words....everything worked fine and the person she wanted to reach just wasn't picking up. She kept interrupting the interpreter while he was interpreting, and when I said based on what was communicated, the fact she didn't get any error messages or anything, that the person simply didn't pick up. I recommended she reach out via other means and then this launched a tirade about how I'm not helping her and how she's planning now on leaving my company because of this.

Not Listening,"So, I work at a call center for an electric company and one of the calls we get most is about payment arrangements for the bill. I am happy to help, but I'd be even happier if I didn't get yelled at because of a misunderstanding.

So we started out fine. I took a small payment, then she asked about a payment arrangement for the rest of her past due bill. I explained what we could do for her. The first payment is always due like the next week and it defaults to an amount that would be similar to the payments further out. So say her total was $300, split into 6 payments. $50 due next week. She tells me that she cannot pay that so soon. So when I want to help out a customer, I start thinking of ways that I can go around the system. So I made her first payment $5 due today (which I'm not really supposed to do without a supervisor's approval but that rule isn't heavily enforced). Since she already made a payment today, it would go towards that. Then the next payment would be due in a month, so she would have plenty of time to get the money. 

I explain all this to her, she accepts, and then we talk about other things for like 10 seconds. I go back to summarize the process and tell her the first payment is due today and before I can remind her that its already paid, I get:

C: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME!! I TOLD YOU I AM ON A FIXED INCOME AND I CAN'T PAY ANYTHING!! 

M: *in the calmest voice* I am listening to you ma'm. I know-

C: NO, YOUR'E NOT!! I CAN'T PAY ANYTHING ELSE TODAY!! 

M: M'am, I am listening to you, but you've got to listen to me. You don't need to pay anything else today. I am trying to help you. 

C: Oh...

I can still hear her yelling into my ear.",76,0,0
“Well that’s just asinine! I’ll just pay the balance if that’s the case!”,"Today I worked on chat support where I also take escalations. 

Account came through, no payments since June/July. 

Built up a balance between now and then, wanting to work out a payment plan. Agent transfers the customer to my line. I laid it out how said plan would work, and then they stopped me mid sentence. 

“That just adds up to what I owe”

“Yes- and without penalty it can be paid over the course of —“

“No. Well this was all a waste of time. Well that’s just asinine! If I have to pay it all I’ll just do that when I pay my bill anyway.

I’m sending the underground mafia after you,"I work in auto/cycle insurance. As I’m sure most of you know, your policy has to match what state you live in as each state has different rates, minimum liability limits, etc. If it doesn’t match it can cause issues if a claim is filed.

For a bit more background, when this man called in and I quickly flipped over to see if there were any recent notes or activities to be aware of I found PAGES of notes from supervisors. To summarize the situation that has been going on for months: the man disclosed he did not live in the state his policy and address were listed as since he was a traveling musician. All we really needed from him was proof of residency. No big deal right? After looking over all the notes, I knew exactly where this convo was going and mentally prepared myself to parrot the exact same things my supervisors have already told him multiple times.

Me: Hello, sir, how can I help today?

Caller: Yes, we’re having a bit of an ongoing issue. All I want to do is make a payment but no one will let me.

M: I understand, sir. Unfortunately, due to no proof of residency being sent in I cannot take a payment today. You’re due to expire soon and unless that’s sent in we can’t lift the non renewal cancellation.

C: What do I need to send in?

M: We can accept any of the following: [provides 8 options]

C: Well I don’t have any of those.

M: Not even a current utility bill?

C: No, I get my mail at that address you have but I don’t live there. Can I send in a bank statement?

M: We cannot unfortunately.

C: Why not?

M: It does not fall under the list of acceptable proof of residency per our company guidelines.

C: Well what about the bills you send me?

M: No.

C: Why the hell not? That counts as a bill!

M: We have to send the mail somewhere and using ourselves as proof of residency does not fall under acceptable.

C: Heh, this is ridiculous. If I can’t send in anything then what can I do?

M: Then the policy is going to cancel and will not be renewable. I do apologize but we need to have acceptable proof to keep the policy active.

C: You know what? I’ve already notified the insurance commissioner of what you guys and the local agencies are doing and he’s gonna keep a real close eye on this case. I’m taking all of you companies and you reps to court and sue the hell out of you for tampering with my identity and discrimination against old and disabled people. **CLICK**

Turns out he called back later that week and got the supervisor who trained me. Same story except this time he also threaten to send the underground mafia after her and the previous reps who spoke with him on top of asking who our CEO is so he could break his f*cking fingers. Needless to say, he was labeled as a threat and handled by the managers. He won’t be getting insurance with us again.

TL;DR: man refused to send in acceptable proof of residency because he didn’t live where he said he did. Threatened to sue individuals, companies, agencies for discrimination and tampering with identity. Called later that week and threatened one of my sups and the rest of us with the underground mafia and physical harm to our CEO. Managers labeled him as a threat and blocked him.",42,0,0
Fed ex shipping label,"Part of my job at the company I work for is to help people when they're unable to print out shipping labels via our platform. Today I got this customer.

Me: Hi, my name is Portieay with *company*, how can I help today?

Customer: yeah, I'm trying to print a shipping label for FedEx from your website, but it won't let me, I was hoping you could help with that?

Me: sure, absolutely, what's the message you're getting?

Customer: it says that FedEx doesn't provide service for that area. I checked on their website too, and it said the same thing, so why can't I print out a FedEx shipping label?

Me:  ... ...

Life Insurance Woes,"One of the call centres I used to work at was as a life insurance rep for a major Canada/US company.  It is frustrating to have to give someone bad news when someone in their family recently died, but luckily, many of them are simply greedy people that are way more concerned about a free payday than the loss of a loved one. I do have a lot of sympathy for someone losing a loved one, but not for someone trying to use a death as a way to get one over on the insurance company, there is a line. The three most common kinds of frustrating calls I had, naturally, all had to do with money, no surprise there: (all of these have been approximated to the average question from them and average responses by me)

1) ""My (relative) died a little while ago, and in their things, I found this life insurance policy from 1963, how do I go about claiming this?""

*Well, yes they took one out in 1963, but then they stopped paying for it in 1966. No, I don't care that you have a physical policy in your hand that says you're entitled to money.  We don't just come and break in your house and punch you until you give it back.  It isn't worth anything unless you follow all the parts of the policy until they pass away, including paying us. No, I don't care that you think they did. I know they didn't, so unless you can find me some proof of that.  No, I don't care that you'll sue us because you're holding a policy. This will not make it to court, that's a contract which they stopped following 50 years ago, not an IOU.*

2) ""My (relative) is in the hospital, they're not going to make it, how do I claim this policy?

*(Disclaimer, if this were a five, ten thousand dollar policy that the caller was worried about because it was the only way they were going to pay for a funeral, I would have some sympathy to the issue in that situation, for sure.  This was virtually never the case. This was virtually always an entitled-sounding grandkid with a very expensive policy.) Um, first they actually have to pass away.  No, being sick and close is not good enough.  No, I don't want to talk to the doctor.  No, you need a death certificate first.  No, you can't fill out most of the form right now and send that in later.  NO WE CAN'T TAKE YOUR WORD THAT THIS IS ""CLOSE ENOUGH""*

3) ""I'm cancelling my policy.  Since I never used it, how do I get back all that money I put into it?""

*(Disclaimer #2, there are certain kinds of policies where you do get money back when you cancel it, depending on circumstances and type, I'm not going to get into those. Suffice it to say, these calls were never those kinds of policy.) ""Yeah, I do realize that you didn't use it.  Life insurance is rather cut and dried that way.  But, uh, no, you don't get back the money you put into it because you didn't use it. That's how insurance works. Yes, really.  Yes, really, like your car, or like your house. You don't get your money back if they didn't get damaged in the last year, do you? We wouldn't make a profit that way.  No, it's not a scam, I promise. No, this isn't illegal.  Yes, I'm really really sure. Oh? You aren't going to use our company next time?  What exactly do you picture the ""next time"" being?*

I'm sure I could think of more too.  If I do, and you liked these, I'll be sure to post them.  Also, if you have any questions, feel free to ask, while some of this stuff varies by area, most of the important parts are the same or very close to it everywhere. Thanks for reading!",69,0,0

Sales team flipped out because a customer emailed the wrong address,"It came to the attention of the sales team that a customer had been unsuccessfully trying to contact us by replying to the automated email they received from a calendar invitation. A slack conversation was then started which went something like this:

Dev: this is just the email account used for sending invitations, it's not monitored

Sales: it has to be monitored! Someone was trying to contact our team by replying to the invite and didn't get through!

Me: surely we don't want to create extra work for ourselves because one person emailed the wrong address...

Sales: we can't take the risk! We might lose business! 

Dev: we could make it forward to service team but then you'd see every single accepted or declined in the main inbox

Me: let's not do that.

Sales: couldn't we just change the email address to ""noreply@xxx""

Dev: it used to be that, then we got asked to change it to something more ""friendly""

And now for a short but funny story about call center life bleeding into real life,"I've worked in a call center for just about a decade now. When that happens, it impacts the way you answer any phone calls as I'm sure everyone here knows. 

Well I volunteer for an animal rescue on my days off (because if this job has taught me anything, animals &gt; people). With my experience, I've basically become the dedicated rescue customer service face and am in charge of answering any calls we get on the little rescue flip phone. 

Queue today. Rescue phone rings. I answer as normal. 

Me: Thank you for calling [rescue] my name is Hashtagsi. How can I help? 

Applicant: ....

Me: Hello? Can you hear me? 

Applicant: ""oh shit. I thought you were a recording! Sorry!"" 

Me: Oh yeah. That happens a lot when you work in a call center. Sorry about that. 


Short interaction, we shared a good laugh, but I thought you guys might relate. 

As a side note: the best thing about volunteering for incoming calls? If someone's a jerk, their application gets denied. I like to think it's a way to rescue any future customer service folks those people will come in contact with. Rescue within a rescue I guess. 

Last thing: anyone who works for a phone call center, we are coming up on the tough part of the year. Keep your head up and remember, no matter what the customer says, you're amazing. Keep up the great work.

Funny little story about someone angry at not wanting to give information needed to better assist them.,"This happened many years ago when I used to work in the call center at a VA hospital. When a veteran calls in, we have to ask for their last name and last 4 of their social security number in order to verify that it’s actually them since there are an incredible number of vets with the same last name. Pretty standard across all VA hospitals in the U.S. The vast majority of the vets that call in don’t have a problem with this. This is a story of one who did.

Me: Thank you for calling the ___ VA. This is Gwent4Life. How may I help you?

(I worked in the specialty center which housed the orthopedic, podiatry, ENT, surgical, dental, etc. You get the picture.)

Vet: I need to speak to Dr. ____. (Head of the clinic).

Me: Okay. Did he call you directly?

Vet: No! Just let me talk to him! 

(Guy was already getting angry and the call just started.)

Me: Okay. What’s your name sir?

Vet: (Gives first name).

Me: Okay. What’s your last name?

Vet: You don’t need to know! Just get me Dr. ___!

(Guy is yelling into the phone at this point.)

Me: (In a calm voice) Well I kinda need t know who is calling for Dr. ____ as it is something that the doctors like to know. 

Vet: I don’t fucking care! Just give me Dr ____. 

Me: Sir, I must ask you refrain from cussing or else I’ll have to terminate the call. Now please, tell me your last name and I can see what I can do.

Vet: I ain’t giving you shit! If you ain’t going to help me, then you can fuck off!

*click*

I laugh a little to myself and with my coworkers. Then the phone rings again. I got the same guy again. At this point I make a mental note of the phone number. 

Me: Thank you for calling ____ VA. This is Gwent4Life, how may I help you?

Vet: Get me Dr. ____!

Me: (knowing it’s the same guy) Ok sir. What’s your name and last 4?

Vet: You’re not getting shit from me, just be a good little boy and get me the fucking doctor!

Me: I’m sorry sir, but I have to know who is calling in order to inform the doctor. 

Vet: This is going fucking nowhere! Fuck you!

*click*

I tell my coworkers he called again and hung up a second time. We laugh a bit and I tell them to forward me the number if they see it.

My coworkers phone rings, and he says it’s the same guy. I tell him to forward it to me.

Me: Thank you for calling the _____ VA. This is Gwent4Life, how may I help you?

Silence. For only a couple seconds but felt like longer.

Me: Hello? Is anyone there? (In my kindest, sweetest voice)

Vet: long pronounced sigh.

This happened at the end of the day. At 4:30 pm the phones shut off and the calls get routed to information, and they are far less helpful. I laughed again, gathered my stuff, and left.

On this day in particular I had a difficult customer who needed me to break down every little thing regarding their retirement account and explain all the processing the state and federal do with taxes. 

Later that day my friend called me and we were talking, I started ranting about said interaction and accidentally slipped into my customer service voice while explaining to him how retirement accounts worked and why I was upset. At one point he said “ahhh okay. I get it now” which is what my customer said as wel. So my automatic response was “fantastic, is there anything else I can help you with today?” Then silence. I quickly realized what I said and apologized profusely. My friend was like “damn u/imeghann I thought you were done with me or something.” We ended up having a good laugh about it and now he teases me about it constantly.",37,0,0
Being naive can bite you... in the foot?,"More tales from the psychic line!

I’m minding my own business one day, a fresh faced, innocent little 20-something, when my phone rings. Being the dutiful employee I am, I answer. 

It’s a sale call, and so I start chatting the guy up a bit before I ease into the sales pitch. It’s going good. He tells me he owns a shoe store, and I jokingly ask him if he’s got shoes in my size (I’m a woman who has very, very large feet). He boggles at my shoe size, like most people do. We share a chuckle over how the only shoes I could find at the time that were female in any capacity was from websites for drag queens. 

I didn’t get it right away when he starts probing a bit about how my feet are shaped. After all, he’s a shoe store owner, right? So I innocently answer some of his questions until I realize his voice is starting to take on this...tone. 

You know the tone. A little too interested, a smidge deeper, a touch too flirty. 

And then I hear it: the unmistakable sound of a man spanking that little monkey for all it’s worth.

All I could say was “Gross!” as I disconnected. 

And then I got scolded for not trying to pitch the sale anyway.",95,0,0
The happiest customer I had in the worst company I worked for," 

(Disclaimer: this was about 13 years ago, I don't remember the exact tech support steps as I haven't worked on this setup in 12 years as well. This could probably go in [r/talesfromtechsupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/) as well, but I think it's more of a commentary on call centres)

I was working in the cable internet company that the US probably hates the most as the most senior person of our tech 1.5 (the team that handles the weird one-offs that tier 1 gets, in theory, and has a little more access to our software, in the same room) Within my building of hundreds of employees, I was the final go-to person on anything that could be solved in-house (without tier 2 escalation or higher)

I spent 98% of my time helping tier 1 through their days. However, the way employee metrics worked for annual review, I had to take a few tier 1 calls a week so that I'd have numbers for average call time and all that jazz that we hated. Background over.

Customer calls in, polite but very direct that he's had an internet problem he hasn't been able to get fixed, he's called us repeatedly, called his computer manufacturer who says it's our fault, nothing too uncommon. The notes on his account back it up, it appears previous reps have made a worthwhile effort at trying to solve it. He says this is the last chance we have before he cancels and goes elsewhere. (Which doesn't bother me, but I try to do my job right)

He's a really reasonable guy, I tell him that I'll promise to take every step in the book with him to check everything we possibly can, and he agrees to let me try. And to his credit, he does every single thing I ask him, and we cut zero corners on the steps. He checked every cable, removed and replaced them as asked, clicked everything I told him to click and nothing else, read everything he saw on his screen right to me. He was an excellent customer.

So, the modem is getting everything it needs. Looks correct through my tools and the lights on his end. Computer is pulling an ip address valid for our network. Browser comes up with being unable to connect to anything. Cleared every cache and cookie and etc thing I could think of, no go.

Now, through all of this, I'm following our ticketing system (which includes a troubleshooting tree) to the letter, looking at my reference material as to what he should be seeing. We're getting down to what I know from experience is one of the final steps before my system says ""not our problem."" We get to checking the tcp/ip settings (this is where my tech support memory fails me as to exactly what tcp/ip settings so don't ask but I'll approximate it)

""Ok, so can you check that settings A, B, and C say this?) I ask.

""Yep, A, B, and C are exactly that. And Box D is unchecked.""

Internally: ""Wait a sec. Box D isn't in the troubleshooting tree, but my reference material shows Box D being checked...it sounds somewhat relevant, I guess?""

""Um, can you check Box D for me? And now, check your internet?""

""OH MY GOD THE INTERNET WORKS!""

The customer then goes on and on about how thrilled he is that his problem is finally solved, and how much work I put into checking every last thing for him, how I solved it after all the hours he spent trying to get this fixed. He asks to speak to my manager, which I of course let him do, stayed on the line and heard him gush to my boss for a solid 10 minutes.

Couple hours later, the Quality Assurance guy (the guy that listens to recordings to make sure we're doing our job right and scores them) comes over and tells me he listened to that call, and then presents me with my scoresheet, a big fat zero, lowest score possible.

""You went out of scope, Box D isn't in the troubleshooting tree. Zero.""

My boss lost his mind before I could. No appeal, no second opinions allowed under our system. Happiest customer I ever had, and scored zero. This is the exact moment that I decided ""work to rule"" was going to be status quo from now on.",52,0,0
A win!,"This is a silly happy story about a call that started badly and ended well.

My Sunday shift *should* have been a quiet and easy day, with plenty of time to catch up on true crime articles in between sparse calls.

It was not to be.

Many customers buy our product regularly, every week. After extensive advertising to warn everybody, our most popular flagship product changed on Saturday.

So Sunday was HOT with ""how DARE you make these changes??!!"" and ""I don't UNDERSTAND"" and of course ""why didn't you tell me about the change??!!""

It actually wasn't toooo bad. The queue didn't let up all morning, but I mostly got the calmer customers who simply didn't understand the changes and needed someone to explain it clearly.

And then I got a call from a woman in her late 70s who had a medical condition which caused her to talk ... very ... slowly. She needed to gasp between each word.

C: Yes ... this ... is ... where ... I ... was ... before . ... If ... I ... had ... a ... tomohawk ... I ... would ... chop ... up ... the ... damn ... phone ... so ... I ... don't ... have ... to ... deal ... with ... this.

Me: Okay, let's see if I can beat it into submission for you, so hopefully you won't need that tomohawk and you can keep your phone for calls and whatnot.

C: [*laughs wheezily*]

_- - I easily navigate the customer past the hurdle [it is a very common one] and she gets the result she wanted. - -

C: Well ... you ... made ... that ... so ... easy. ... Thank ... you ... dear.

Me: Oh you're very welcome! Everything's easy if you already know how. I know that process is not very intuitive. On the one hand, it's infuriating, because we *should* have a note on that page about how to get past that; but on the other hand, I like it because it means you have to ring me, and that means I have a job!

_ - - Customer had another breathless laugh, agreed that it was good that I had a job, and said she hoped I had a lovely afternoon 'without too many silly old ladies like her.' 

I assured her that she wasn't silly, but the website was.

It was a nice moment.

The call started with her being ... *absolutely ... disgusted* ... and ended with her smiling down the phone and wishing me a lovely afternoon.

Ask a stupid question.....,"Please do not use this story elsewhere. Hope you enjoy!

I try to be professional. I really do. However, now and then I encounter someone who asks something a bit.....stupid.

This was way back in 2008. The Theme Park company I worked for had instituted a transport system to get people from the airport to their on-site hotel. It was pretty spiffy, and we had people asking about it all the time. One person had called and was asking about hotels, tickets, dining options, all the usual stuff. I was ready to put together a modest package that wouldn't exactly bump up my commission that month, but would help maintain a respectable average. Then we finally got to the crucial question.

Me: So, let's put this all together. When did you plan on coming to visit us?

Guest: Oh I probably won't be coming until somewhere around 2015.

My brain, slightly stroking out: Are....are you f-ing serious right now? You've been jawing away for forty minutes about a trip you plan on taking more than half a decade from now? Are you insane?

Me: Well bear in mind, things my change by then, especially the pricing we've discussed....

Guest: Oh yes of course. But, one more question. Will they still have the \[Complimentary Bus Service\] at that point?

At that moment, two things happened simultaneously. First, I finally snapped and decided I was done with this call. Second, my team leader came walking down the aisle behind me and was just passing me as I said:

""No, ma'am, we'll have discontinued \[Complimentary Bus Service\] by that point in time.""

Remember The Exorcist, when Linda Blair's head spun around? I think my leader was glaring at me a full three seconds before her body caught up with the turn. I had a vague awareness of the guest sounding disappointed.

""However,"" I continued, looking at my leader as I spoke, ""we will be instituting a new program, where big, burly Scandinavian men will haul you and your luggage onto their shoulders and carry you down the interstate.""

My leader threw her hands up in shock, then waved at me as if banishing me to another dimension, then turned and rushed away as fast as her heels would carry her before she heard more. 

The guest, of course, was completely confused and I explained that it was a little joke, since I couldn't predict what would happen so far in the future. Told her to have a nice day and went and bemoaned my dropping dollar-to-call ratio.",253,0,0
Winter and heating calls for entitlement...,"So got another one for the self entitled, council housed tw**s, who want everything at the click of their fingers at 10pm on a Sunday night. 

Female calls in. Has called British Gas to her house as her boiler is not working. British Gas informs her that the problem is her boiler, which has a low pressure and not the gas supply. As the property belongs to the council, British Gas is not allowed to touch the boiler and they honestly don’t care. 

I go through our standard questions, such as whether anyone has any covid symptoms, and whether there are any medical requirements and any children under 6 months old. We also have to ask about back up heating and hot water. 

The caller informs me that she has no back ups for heating but has an electric shower. She also has a 1 year old in the house, no medicals/disabilities. 

As we are an out of hours service, we have to call our on call manager who says yes or no to a repair. As it’s late and the caller doesn’t fit into our vulnerability group, he says no. Pretty standard at 10pm on a Sunday. We only have 1 engineer and we really have to prioritise those that really need it. 

I go back to tell her this, she gets pissy. Wants to speak to the manager. I advise that the on call is purely for us to speak to and ask whether we can do a repair or not. She states she will make a complaint. I’m guessing that was to make me scared, and maybe it will twist my arm to change the decision, but guess what, don’t give a single f**k. I still book her in for a repair to the boiler but she just has to wait til the next working day which is less than 12 hours away from the point when she called.

She ends the call with a “thanks for nothing” because I’m the big bad gal making her wait for 12 hours until an engineer can come fix her heating. Cause it’s “freezing cold and they are freezing to death!”, it really isn’t, it’s quite a mild night tonight.

I do wonder if some of these people know what a jumper/hoodie/dressing gown/socks are at times.

How to be lazy through mathematics.,"Please do not use this story elsewhere. Hope you enjoy!

These days I'm a math tutor, and when my kids ask how ""real world situations"" are ever solved with math like in their textbook problems, I bring up this story.

The Theme Park Company I worked for had a lot of metrics we had to follow that ranged from bonkers to stupid, but one of the more lenient ones was the ""Sign In"" metric.

In short, they acknowledged that we couldn't be on the phone literally every minute of the day. Sometimes a call ran over, sometimes there were technical issues, sometimes people needed an extra potty break, or a trip to the water cooler, etc. (Team meetings, time with our team leaders, official breaks etc didn't count). So the company had a little line on our dashboard that showed how many hours we were scheduled vs how many we were on the phones, and calculated the percentage. So long as the line read 95% or higher, no red flags.

Seems like a lot, right? No real time for any extra breaks, maybe a minute here and there.

Except......math time!

On average in a month, I worked about 200 hours, doing 10 hour shifts 4 - 5 days per week. Know what 95% of 200 is? 10! A whole 10 hour shift! I literally could not take a single call on the last day of the month and STILL be at 95% sign in. And if I worked a lot of OT, I could do more!

As soon as I realized this, the last day of the month became my favorite day. I still had to show up, sign in and take one or two calls, just so no one wondered why I wasn't on at all. But in between that? I read a book, sat in the break room watching tv and played on my laptop all day.

A few people started asking how I was goofing off so much. I told them I had some extra time to burn off my sign in. They were shocked to realize how much free time they had. The next month I had a few people asking me to look at their dashboard and calculate their ""sign in surplus."" Another month after that, almost two dozen people had me helping to calculate their numbers. I had almost two teams worth of people de-stressing on the last day of the month instead of worrying about their metrics.

We all got a day off if we wanted it, we didn't have to worry about metric issues and we got to skip the last day of a month, which wasn't usually good for sales (or could hurt your average and therefore commission if you got a bunch of small calls) without muss or fuss. This technically also left any good sales to junior employees who weren't read for this kind of setback.

Math you guys. It really pays off!

CSATS and DSATS,"Not entirely sure if this is a thing in all call centers, (Most likely), but we're judged by our metrics and the most important metric most of the time is Csats.

customer: I understand that. How much am I paying for the service?
me: Oh, I’m sorry. I must have not explained that right. You’re paying 3 dollars a month for the service. 
customer: No, that’s not what I asked. I asked how much I’m paying for the service.
me: I understand what you’re asking. Your monthly plan you’re paying 3 bucks for the service.
Customer: How much am I paying for the device?
me: You’re paying 1 dollar a month for the device 
Customer: So I’m paying 3 bucks for the device and 1 buck for the service? 
Me: No, you’re paying 3 bucks for the service and 1 buck for the device. 
Customer: I just want to know how much the service is. I don’t need to know how much the device is. 
Customers Husband: (in the background) Honey, she’s explained it to you several times. It’s 3 bucks for the service and 1 buck for the tablet.
Customer: Oh okay, that makes more sense to me. How much would it be per month with the tablet and the two phone lines? 
Me: Let me check on that.  I do see here you’re also paying for internet service as well, did you want me to add that in to the total as well.
Customer: No. I just want the cost of the two phones and tablet. 
Me: Oh okay, that would be _______.
Customer: Wait, you didn’t include our internet service. How much would that be? 
Me:

Guy tried to pull a fast one on us,"I posted this about a year ago in another sub but it never got approved I guess? I figured I'd share with you. I work in emergency roadside assistance (ERS). There are many situations that we don't cover. Also, I had posted this the day it happened and just copy and pasted from the old post so while I did my best to update the text, if I mention something about it happening today or yesterday, I just forgot to change it.

One situation we can't tow you is if your registration/tag/plates are expired. Well we had a member, about a year ago, that called for service and when the driver got there the tags had expired in July of 2010. So, the driver told the member we couldn't tow it and left. (Customer was at his house btw so not in a dangerous situation) Well I got a call from the garage (We call tow companies garages) about a call on their board. It was this member again. He had placed another call through. And also the tow destination was going to a storage facility which we dont tow to because that usually means the member is just going to store their vehicle and doesn't want to have to pay for a tow truck so calls us.

Well I called this member and ask about the tags. He said that he told the driver that he had the tags and he just had to get them from his house and they're on the vehicle now. I then told him that we can't tow to storage facilities. The guy gets a little huffy and says that it's going to a repair shop that is behind the storage facility and storage place is the only building with an address. Okay fine. I tell him that we'll tow it but the driver isnt going anywhere within the storage property and will only drop the vehicle in the repair shops lot and not outside the gates of the storage facility like he had suggested.

So I call the garage back to give them the go ahead and they say that the guy had 2 different plates for the vehicle and isnt that illegal? What?? They didn't say anything about that the first time. So I call the member back AGAIN and say ""Oh and I forgot to mention, but when the driver arrives you'll need to show him the registration for the vehicle."" This is so we can match it with the VIN on the car and verify the tags are the legal tags and not tags he took off of some other vehicle.

Well this guy gets upset and starts rambling on about how he's been a member for 12 years and he's never had this much trouble ect, ect. Then he goes on to say that while he was putting the tags on, he fell and broke his hip and is waiting for an ambulance because of us and is probably going to cancel his membership. Ummm what??

First, Ive never broken a hip before but I know people that have and it's painful. He said it so matter factly and didn't sound to be in any pain. He said it in a way that made me think he thought that I would suddenly want to do damage control and say nevermind to the registration. And he made it seem like the ambulance wasn't coming right away. Overall he was just being a total jerk and I was certain he was lying but couldn't call him out on it.

So anyway I hang up with him and call the garage back and tell them what he said about how he supposedly broke his hip, is waiting for an ambulance and will have the registration. So less than an hour goes by and my coworker tells me that the garage is on the phone and wants to talk to me personally. Turns out the same driver that went there before gets to location again and the member pulls up and gives him the registration....for the vehicle he just drove there in. So the driver goes over to the vehicle needing towed and compares VINs (He did this just to cover his butt) and sure enough they dont match. So he left and called his dispatcher who then called me to let me know.

So I call the member one last time and let him know that because the registration didnt match, he's not getting towed. Well he was not happy and started bitching again about how he doesn't care what we say, we towed his $60,000 vehicle to a storage facility in the past so he doesnt understand why it's suddenly a problem (so basically he just admitted he was planning on storing the vehicle) and how he's gonna cancel his membership and he broke his hip (he didnt. The driver said that it did look like he fell and he had a scraped elbow but was walking around just fine) and finished up by saying he doesnt want anyone calling him anymore.

Lady threatens a driver but then says she didn't because the gun was registered to her,"Sorry for posting back to back to back but I like sharing my experiences with others that have an idea of what it's like to deal with similar situations. 

Anyways, I don't know why but I randomly remembered a call I had gotten late last year. I work in ERS as a dispatcher so I talk to the garages a lot. Well the one day, the garage called in and advised that their driver went to this members house to tow her vehicle but she ended up threatening him with a gun so he called the police and had to file a report and everything. The reason she threated the driver? He wouldn't tow her vehicle because the tags had expired about a year ago which means it's not a covered tow. 

Well after the police and driver had left, the member calls back and places another call but requests another garage. We find out it's the same lady and call her to tell her that she wasn't getting service because:

A. Her tags are expired

B. She threatened the driver with a gun. 

Her response? I didn't threaten anyone. All I told him, was that if he touched my vehicle, I was going to shoot him. Which is my right because the gun is registered to me. 

Pretty sure my brain short circuited after that. I had to explain to her that YES that is a threat and it doesn't matter if her gun is registered. All that means is that she can't get into trouble for having the gun. I don't think she fully understood even after explaining to her multiple times why she wasn't getting service.",113,0,0
It was so satisfying when he realized.,"This happened a few years ago and it still makes me laugh when I think about it.

I’m on the phone with a customer and it is now half way through November. He missed his October payment and has two payments due. He’s adamant that he did not miss his October payment. He keeps yelling about how, at this time, in November, his upcoming October payment isn’t due so why the hell are we charging it now (!!!!!?!????!!!!)

I explained to him (slowly) that October was last month. He didn’t pay. He now owes for October and November. I’ll never forget what he said or the tone in his voice.

I'm not a mind reader. And you just can't read.,"I work in finance and I do a bit of everything from complaints to collections to admin to data entry (basically whatever my boss tells me to do). 

My company use to use a live chat service and kind of phased it out to the point where no one else is trained on it and I'm the last team member standing who knows how to use it. 

(Some details changed to remove any specifics). 


A customer (C) sends me a message. 

C: hi I'd like to know my payout figure at 30/10/2020. 

Me: no problem, so assuming your payment scheduled for 15/10/2020 is successful, your balance would be $300 to payout. Would you like me to send you some details to make this payment on 30/10/2020?

Customer: yes please. 

So I email the customer BPay information, I specify in the email that if the payout is made before 15/10/2020 their payout figure would be $350, a payout after that, including 30/10/2020 will be $300, this payout figure expires on 15/11/2020, the date of the next scheduled payment. 

The customer sends me an email straight back with a receipt for $300. Okay then...

A call comes through a couple of days later. Verification complete.

C: I sent a message the other day and asked for my payout figure, I paid it and now it is saying I still have another payment of $50 due. 

Me: yes, you made a payment of $300 which left a balance on your account for one payment. 

C: but I wanted to pay my account out, I processes the amount they gave me. 

Me: yes, that was me you were speaking to, you asked for your payout as of 30/10/2020 and I provided that, I mentioned you'd have another payment prior to then and I gave you two payout figures, one if paid prior to the next payment and one for if you waited until after your payment which includes 30/10/2020 as requested. 

C: no I wanted an immediate payout figure. 

Me: I have records here if you require of your messages to me, they specifically request the payout as at on 30/10/2020. I also gave you a payout figure for the immediate payout figure. 

C: so now I need to make another payment and get charged more fees? You're just trying to take my money!

Me: I gave you the information you requested which was a payout at the end of October. 

C: you should've used common sense and known I wanted to pay it out immediately! 

Me: I gave you the payout figure for immediate payout as well (I then read word for word my entire email to her). 

C: well now I'm getting charged more because you didn't use common sense!

Me: as I said, I gave you the information you requested, you're welcome to make another payment and clear the account or it will direct debit on 15/10/2020 and close your account. 

C: well now I pay an extra fee regardless. 

Me: yes

The Day I Learned what Hell was Like,"Fair warning: this is long. I need you to understand my torture.   
Please don't use this elsewhere.

It started just the same as any other day. I arrived at \[Popular Theme Park\]'s call center, punched in and checked my emails. Everything seemed calm with the usual over-the-cubicle conversations happening before we opened. None of us knew what was in store. If we had suspected, perhaps we could've escaped in time.

One by one it took us. The glitch. Unbeknownst to us, there was a major flaw in our online booking system that day, and people's information was being messed up on their flight reservations. The one thing that we absolutely needed to be correct, because we couldn't fix it. Not only could we not fix it, but our general Guest Services department couldn't fix it either. Only a special section of Guest Services, Flight Services, had the ability to change anything. They were a secretive group, cloistered away in a corner room of the center, performing the sacred rituals of their tribe that only they knew about, to persuade the Airport Gods to bequeath us a change on a computer screen. 

The calls began pouring in. Dozens of agents hearing the same complaint. ""My flight information is wrong!"" This wasn't the usual ""you spelled my child's name wrong on the form only I filled out!"" This was on us and it was all kinds of messed up. 

Suddenly, several dozen call center reps were dialing the same extension, jockeying to get ahold of four Flight Service reps. Queues started to build. Not only were we waiting, but we had dozens upon dozens of people waiting for us so they could hear us say ""please hold.""

But it got worse....

Flight services' computers that communicated with the airlines were down. They had to put us on hold and call everything in manually, which meant they were on hold as well, waiting for the airlines, while we waited for them and guests waited for us, compounding the problem.

But it got worse.....

Aside from the stress of seeing the call queue hit triple digits (usually a problem reserved for peak holiday time), we couldn't just put our headsets down and sit back. We had to sit and listen to the hold music and be ready for when the service rep picked up. One person made the mistake and was hung up on and had to start again. Our company used music from its theme parks and movies and other pop music projects, so that was in our ear nonstop while we waited.

But it got worse.....

The hold music system was glitching. We would hear the ""beginning"" of the track and the opening song. A jaunty tune that was meant to get you happy. It lasted only twenty seconds before going into a pop song. A pop song the company had sent into ""way overplayed"" status long before this. It would get about 80% of the way through the song, then suddenly stop, making my OCD alarms go off like mad. Then the track would start again. And again. And again. And again, always resetting about 80% of the way through a song I absolutely hated. 

But it got worse.....

Flight services picked up after two hours and informed me they'd have to put me on hold to call in the change. Cue the queue! The music came back.....for another hour....

I was now over three hours into my shift. I was still on my first call. My head was spinning. The bouncy pop song was permeating my brain. At that point, I would have gladly ripped my headset from the computer. 

But it got worse.....

You mustn't let the customer think you forgot about them! The entire time, I had to check back in with the guest every few minutes to tell them I was still waiting, and hear how frustrated they were, and to find out they too were being driven crazy by the hold music, and when we were done they wanted to speak to my supervisor to complain about this. Joy.

Almost three and a half hours into the call, it was resolved. The guest was relieved, and in the end understood were having computer trouble and didn't complain about me, especially when they found out I had to listen to the same half-loop of music. I told them to have a great day and we looked forward to seeing them. I made my notes and signed off on the call.

And then the second call came in...same as the first. I worked thirteen hours that day, trying to help clear the queue, only took eight calls and made no sales. The only silver lining was that seven hours into it, I took lunch and the company began routing the issue calls to a group that would do call backs. 

On the bright side, the bar near us made a lot of money off of us that night.

Entitled member doesn't understand why we won't act like a taxi cab for her,"I work in emergency roadside assistance. We get A LOT of entitled people but this lady was by far the most entitled I feel. 

This member called in earlier today and ended up getting transferred to my supervisor (sup) because she wasn't happy that we were telling her, her request wasn't covered. The lady wanted our driver to pick up her and her husband, along with their dogs and tow the vehicle to the repair shop. She then wanted the driver to wait while the shop looked at the veh to see if they could fix it or not. 

If they couldn't she wanted the driver to then tow them to the airport so they could get a rental and WAIT while they unloaded the vehicle and then tow the vehicle to a tow dest 2 states away. Obviously, this is NOT covered. The drivers are not taxi cabs and we have other members waiting for service so we can't have a driver tied up for so long. 

My sup told her that we can tow it to the repair shop and she could go with it but that we would not be waiting for the shop to look at it and she would have to fine her own ride to the airport. The member kept arguing with her about it, saying we were leaving her stranded. They kept going back and forth until finally she hung on my supervisor. 

So some time goes by and she calls back for an eta. At this point we were still trying to find a garage to assist. We would have had a garage but it turns out that the member wanted papers from the driver that would be towing their vehicle stating that they don't have covid. This is not something we provide. Like most people, our drivers don't get tested unless they get exposed. 

She seriously can't get threw her head how unreasonable her request are and is furious that we won't agree to her demands.",367,0,0
call transfer trouble leads to me getting a warning for possible swatting,"so this might an odd case since i dont work in the call center world, BUT this story is from someone reaching CS customer and somehow got routed to me, a human resource front desk receptionist. I tried my best to help and maybe you folks who deal with weird situations might be able to appreciate this tale.

feel free to remove if it is not appropriate. 

On the mobile, this is my first post here, please be gentle! im normally a lurker, but this was just too funny to not share. Hopefully some of you enjoy the read. Apologies, im a former journalist so I think this will turn out long.  Also, this ACTUALLY HAPPENED TODAY. I'll add tldr at the bottom.   

I'm one of those people who can't seem to get any kind of technology working properly for me. sometimes its a harmless accidental butt dials, other times I'll mistakenly click on my work address while ordering takeout for home. its always something. whatever nbd right?


  So the job i have right now is sort of a HR type of role with some receptionist duties inside a massive fulfillment center (aka a warehouse).   sometimes customer service gets super backed up (a lot of older folks like to call our 1-800 number to place orders ) and somehow when they are waiting too long on hold the call will ring and ring and eventually get transferred to my desk. today the phones were just ringing off the hook all day. I typically get one of these calls a week. today there were at least 6 or 7.

 I love being to help people, but when older generations call a wrong number they take FOREVER to grab a pen and paper. then you have to almost yell so they can hear the number I'm reading off. (that sometimes rings true for people of all ages.. remember I'm in a warehouse so the machines are pretty loud and it drowns out a lot of noise, making it hard for callers and myself to hear one another)  


so my tum tum is ready for lunch and im just about ready to step out for a short break when the phone rings one last time..   


so old dude (OD) says he would like to place an order. convo goes something like this:  

Me: hi, thanks for calling blah blah, can I help you? 

 OD: yeah I'm interested in ordering some food for my cat. 

 (sidebar: I think it's the sweetest thing in the world how old people will literally ride through the gates of hell and back just to ensure their pet has the exact right food.)  

Me: ahh sorry I am unable to help you this that. you've reached a warehouse HR department.  

 OD: you're kidding? I was so happy to finally be off hold.  

Me: yeah sorry I literally have nothing to do with the ordering process, but hang on i think I might be able to transfer you to the correct line. hang on a sec..  so I press the transfer button. next I have to hit the 9 button and then the 1 button before I can dial out. then I just enter the 1-800 number, and then the transfer button. easy enough right?  

yeah.. no. 

maybe you see where this is going..  i tried transferring OD a couple of times, but a random error message kept popping up and it will NOT let me forward the call.  

 OD was super patient with me thank God.  I'm REALLY annoyed at this point. All I want is to grab a snack and sit outside for a little bit. only thing standing in my way is this stupid phone call.   

exasperated i asked him to grab a pen and paper bc this was not working for me. 

I wait for him to grab his pen and paper, then I rattle off the phone number for him. he repeats it back wrong.. I correct him.. he repeats it back again, correct him some more. lol I can only laugh about this to keep myself from hanging up on the poor guy.

finally the call ends, just as I make my way outside for my break I see a police cruiser pull up front, block a few parking spots, and quickly exit the vehicle, taking a brisk walk to the vestibule area at the main entrance. 

since no one was watching reception desk I poked my head in and asked if the officer needed anything.

officer: actually yes. emergency dispatch had a handful of hang up calls, do you know if someone used the phones to call the police?

just then I clicks in my head that I majorly effed up. 

you see, when I was trying to transfer the old man to customer service I was dialing 9-1 and then the 1-800 number. 

the phone only registered the part where I dialed 9-1-1. (emergency number for those not in the states) 

and they got several hang ups bc I tried transferring the call a couple of times. 

in that moment while I realized that, my face turned sooo red, and my eyes got super wide. I came clean and the officer thought it was kind of funny. but I was warned. if it happens again I could face a fine or maybe even jail time for swatting. (not sure if thats true or what, but I do not intend to find out.) 

during this quick conversation, the bell rang for shift change.. and hundreds of people filed out of the warehouse and into the parking lot where they saw me talking to a cop. 

it was like being in high school and hearing the principal call you to the office. everyone's going ""uh ohhhhh what did you do now? 

i.was.mortified. 


at least I learned my lesson, and im never going to make that mistake ever again!

"How dare you, you are racist","I had a customer who, after a few times of me trying to explain something to her in English, still wasn't understanding what I was explaining. I could clearly tell from her name and accent that she was Chinese because I speak mandarin but not enough to have a conversation. Because she was having difficulty understanding me, I politely said ""hey just wanted to mention that we do have reps who speak Cantonese and Mandarin in case you'd feel more comfortable speaking to someone in either of those languages"". ""HOW DARE YOU ASSUME THAT I HAVE A LANGUAGE PROBLEM! YOU ARE SO RACIST! YOU HAVE HORRIBLE INTERPERSONAL SKILLS!"" She screamed at me. I responded ""mam, I'm very sorry if I offended you, I just wanted to make sure you were aware that we offered service in different languages in case you were unaware - I myself speak several languages and I know sometimes it can be easier to do things in a language I'm more comfortable in. I was just wanting to let you know that it was an option."" She screamed"" LET ME TALK TO YOUR MANAGER!""

I transferred her to a local manager and even he struggled to get her to understand a very basic process because of the combination of her language barrier and her lazy attitude. She even specifically asked me ""can't you do this for me? I don't understand and I don't have time or patience to deal with this."" 

I'm not racist. I was only trying to help her to understand a very basic process. I've NEVER had someone react to me like that when I've offered in the past.

I don’t give out my information!!!,"*EDIT* Thanks for the award! I hardly post on Reddit but this was my first award! I know they’re given out like candy nowadays but thank you nonetheless.



I work for customer service for a retail brand. We  service customers via live chat, so, a written channel.


I’m in leadership, so at times I’ll have to take over a chat if the customer becomes too escalated or just asks for a supervisor. 

So we have this lady chat in, simple problem simple fix. She was inquiring about her order not shipping out yet (after 2 days, this is normal) and requested a shipping refund. Easy right?


The issue was, we require customers to verify some information on the order to protect their data - this is industry standard as well. 


But, I ended up having to take over the chat because she would NOT verify ANY information. She would say things like “well, you have that info right in front of you” and “I don’t give out my information like that” and a bit of “this is discrimination against me, you just don’t want to refund the shipping!” 


She did give out her info when she placed the order, so this one was something I had never seen before. 


We go back and forth for about an hour and a half, to no avail. Bear in mind I was positive, reassured her that I’d be happy to take care of the shipping and offer her something else for her time, but we cannot do anything on the order if she won’t verify. I confirmed this with my manager and director, no actions can be taken. 


Anyway, she ends up disconnecting and calling in. She asks to speak to a supervisor. *Queue I AM the manager moment* 

Guess who takes the call? 

I’m pretty good at keeping my cool so I kept my tender voice and let her know I’m the one she spoke with on chat.


Didn’t like that - asks to speak with MY manager. 

Long story short, she cussed my manager out and requested that I be fired. I overheard a bit of this conversation and my manager broke down eventually because this lady was wreaking havoc on our service channels. 


She said “For what? Wanting to protect your privacy? Being incredibly nice to you over the course of 2 hours of you acting petulant? Doing the same thing that we ask all of our associates to do with every customer in order to protect data? Get over yourself lady.” *click*
(Managers are essentially permitted to fight fire with fire if somehow that call gets to them, since there are 4 other people it must go through beforehand.) 


She tries to chat back, I let my manager know, and we block her IP. She tries to call again, we block her number. This took place over a total of about 8 hours. 




Moral of the story, no matter how badly you WANT to help someone, they have to WANT to be helped by you. If you are simply doing your job and sticking to what you know is required to begin with, don’t feel bad with these kinds of people. 



The call center environment is widely noted as one of the most draining, but, it also matters how the company you work for treats the customers. That makes all the difference, because if customer consistently get poor service, they react by being shitty customers. We don’t get too many people like that because our service is top notch, but even so, it’s not as bad as everyone says. It’s just not a job for everyone.",531,0,0
The Motorcycle Man,"It has been a while since I posted here so I figured I'd start back up with one that is a bit more positive. 


For background, I currently work at a large bank and I have worked in various roles in Fraud, Credit Risk, Underwriting and Sales. This story comes from sales. My job was essentially filling out applications over the phone for the company's credit card. 


I was feeling pretty good. I was freshly caffeinated and had just started my first 3:00p-12:00a shift. Around 10:00p I got a call from a very sad-sounding gentleman who told me he needed a credit card to finance repairs to his motorcycle. We found him a good deal that'd work out for him where he wouldn't have any interest for roughly 18 months and he'd also get a decent amount of rewards out of it too. 


Over the course of the call, he opened up about how he bought the motorcycle after his wife had passed away from cancer. He said that they'd always talked about doing a cross country road trip since neither had left the state before.


He told me how he cared for the motorcycle like it was worth a million bucks and how he washed it every time he stopped in case his wife was watching down on him as he made his journey across the country. Eventually, the motorcycle broke down about 3/4 the way to his destination and he didn't have the cash to fix it. I asked him how much he needed and he said it'd roughly be about $1,500. 


I don't know much about motorcycles, but I tried to ask questions to keep the conversation going because you could hear in his voice that even just talking about it made him happy. Plus I had time to kill while we ran his credit. The dude could probably talk for hours about it if I let him.


The application came back approved, but only for $1,200. Not enough. Now, if a customer wasn't satisfied with that amount, we can do some math and possibly increase it a bit. I asked him again how much it'd be and he said ""Oh about $1,500, but a little more would be nice so I can have some wiggle room in case I need it.""


So I did that math, offered him $2,000 instead and he was ecstatic. He wanted to buy me a beer, so he asked if I was anywhere on his route to California. I was not, but I told him I'd treat myself to one tonight for him. He thanked me, I gave him his electronic account number and we ended the call (with a few ""Hell yeah""s from his end). I did have that beer and it was damn tasty.



It's really easy to get jaded after a while, especially right now since everyone seems to be on their worst behavior. It's moments like this that can make the job a little more tolerable.",74,0,0
A Long Shot and a Close Call,"Hello readers! Get comfy, this is a bit long.  
Please enjoy this story, but do not repost it elsewhere.

Many years ago after I got out of retail, I decided to move down south and work in the reservation center for a huge theme park. I became known among many of the managers there by my nickname, ""what did he do now?"" This is one of my favorite ""how are you not fired??"" stories.

Oh, also, we use fake names on the phones, but I'm going to use a faker fake name just to keep things anonymous. I'm a bit infamous there.

Our theme park had multiple resorts, each with a different theme. Some had normal rooms, some had ""villas"" (time-share, apartment-style accommodations) and some were more popular than others. One in particular was pretty much booked up all the time on our end because the time-share folks always got first dibs. Guess where this guest wanted to stay? Our scene begins after I've been there 8.5 hours into a 10 hour day. (I had a 4 on/3 off schedule, which I actually loved). I was a bit tired and not in the mood to suffer fools gladly.

Me: ""Thank you for calling \[Theme Park\] Travel Company, my name is Walter, how can I help you today?""

Guest: \*ugly-cry sobbing\* ""I...hello? Yes. Hi."" \*more sobbing\*

Me: (Inner voice: Oy.....great) ""Yes, ma'am? Can I help you? Are you all right?""

Guest: \*sniffle\* ""Yes....I'm sorry. I'm just so stressed about this. My mother-in-law decided to tell my family, in front of the kids, that she's taking us all to \[Theme Park\], and has now left it to me to book everything.""

Me: (Inner voice: Well...she's a witch with a capital B isn't she?) ""Well, nil desperandum, madam, we'll get you all set. Do you know what it is you're looking for?""

Guest: ""Yes...she wants to stay at the \[Way too popular resort to have openings\].""

My brain: Crap....

Guest: ""And she wants to stay in a 2-bedroom villa."" (The most popular)

My brain: Craaaaaaap....

Me: ""And when are you looking to come down?""

Guest: ""Two weeks from tomorrow.""

My brain: Time of death: 4:57pm.

Me: ""Okay well...I'm going to tell you now, this may take some doing, but let's see what we have. \*looks it up and gets the goose egg I knew I'd get.\* Ma'am, I'm sorry but it appears that resort is all booked up.

Guest: \*sobs and moans\*

Me: ""Okay now, hold tight. Let's play around a bit with this and see what we can do. Are we flexible on the dates at all?""

Guest: ""I...I don't think so. She already made me book the plane tickets. My mother in law is a VERY particular person. She wants things just so and she's VERY picky.""

Me: \*slams head on desk\* ""Well let's see what I can find.""

What followed was a thirty minute exercise in futility as I went through the few options I had, attempting to sell her on features, or on the villas but other resorts, or on any alternative, only to be met with, ""you don't understand! My mother in law is VERY PICKY about things! I'm sorry.""

I finally find her something I really thought would clinch it. I could get them two rooms at the regular hotel side of the resort they wanted, and they'd be on our ""Concierge Level"" (a VERY nice place I've stayed at. Easy to get spoiled). I get four words in and she turns it down when she hears it's not a villa.

Me: ""Ma'am...why is your mother in law so set on a villa?""

Guest: ""Because....it's just how she is. She wants her coffee /just so/. She wants her breakfast made in the morning, she wants to have a sitting area to relax in...""

Me: ""We have those things in other areas--.""

Guest: \*jabbers away\* ""....you just don't understand.""

And that's where I lost it. Cue the verbal cold water.

Me: ""No, no, ma'am. I understand. I just don't care.""

\*Dead silence\*

Me: (Taking advantage of her finally not blubbering) ""Ma'am, this is YOUR vacation too. Let's be real with each other. Who's going to be the one making her coffee, cooking her breakfast and cleaning up after her?""

Guest: ""Well...probably me...""

Me: ""Exactly. And how is that fair to you? Answer: It's not. You're doing the work here, you're the one in charge of this decision, and you are going to be the hero of this story. So, here's what you're going to do. You're going to take these two rooms. Then, you are going to sit back and relax in our private lounge, and WE will make the coffee however she wants it. WE will cook her breakfast, AND dinner! WE will provide free snacks, cookies, cordials and enough wine and spirits that after the first night, I promise you she will be too sloshed to give you any more grief for the rest of the trip.""

Guest: ""It...it comes with all that?""

Me: ""Yes, ma'am!""

Guest: ""Oh! Well...that's better isn't it?""

Me: ""YES!!! Oh, and by the way? It's about $2,000 less than what you would have paid for the villa, and since you said she's paying for it, you get to go be the rock star who saved her a ton of money. So what's her credit card number because at this point we both need to agree that I'm right, and we're doing this.""

After that she was all smiles, gave me the card number and we booked her deposit.

But what's the ""close call"" you ask?

It turns out that call was being observed. My team leader had been called into a conference room with all six Vice Presidents from my call center as well as our second call center, and they decided to listen to a call from her team to see how she was doing as a leader. Guess who they were listening to.

About fifteen minutes after the call ended, my leader (who was normally sweet as sugar) stormed to my cubicle and yanked me into her office. She told me what happened, and apparently when I said ""I just don't care"" all 6 VPs flipped out, pearls tightly clutched, and faces white. My leader had never seen them so terrified. I explained I had to stop her from freaking out. She goes, ""Yeah, NOT LIKE THAT! I want you to know, they said the ONLY reason you aren't fired is because she purchased and was happy in the end. Please don't ever scare me like that again!""

Thankfully this had a true happy ending. The family kept the reservation I suggested, had a great time, and the daughter-in-law wrote a long, very kind letter to the upper-ups, and my leader didn't get in trouble.

But I still giggle to myself picturing the VPs' faces.",51,0,0
Clients who want to talk but wont disclose security information,"I had the most frustrating client today. Last call of the day, Already 6 minutes past when I'm meant to finish and I get this guy. He had been in the queue for about 10 minutes at this point and reception called him on an outbound call to see if he wanted a quote for car insurance. Put him through to my department due to the type of car (Think BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, ""Cherished"" brands). 

I have his details on my screen already, Great. Just gotta pass security and I can get on my way and finally get finished for the day.

Me: ""So just a quick few security questions Mr AHole, What's your postcode and first line of the address?"" - Before this point, He basically just grunted at every question I ask. Not even a ""Yeah"" just mhmm.  
Mr AHole: ""You have my details you tell me.""  
Me: ""I'm sorry I can't disclose that information before running through security.""  
Mr AHole: ""Well you called me, I don't want to disclose that to someone calling me"" (At this point I should mention, Our company name shows on most smart phones via caller id).  
Me: ""The reason I ask is because if you gave an incorrect number last year, We would just be giving out your information to a random client"".   
Mr AHole: ""Well if you can't tell me the address you have on file, Tell me the registration number you  you have.""  
Me: ""Again I can't disclose any information from the file till we pass security"".   
We went back and forth for a few minutes. Him getting more annoyed. What surprised me is that this guy was a security engineer in IT. He knows all about GDPR Etc yet still wouldn't play ball.

At this point I'd had enough, I'd been at work 15 minutes past my finish time - unpaid and I wont be reimbursed my time. I just tell him if he's not happy with us calling him, He can call us from the number listed on our website. He says no. I say well I can't help any further and in my nicest voice I can I say have a lovely evening. He hung up without saying anything else.

I have such short patience with clients like this. If I had disclosed info and we had been reported for it, I would have 100% been reprimanded for it and I just cant be bothered with that sort of hassle at the moment.   
Does anyone else get clients like this? And if so, How do you get through to them about security questions etc?",29,0,0
Hopefully made someone's day - Trans-Confusion,"This likely isn't the right place for this story, but I did work in a call center while this was happening.  I had typed out the story for someone else, so I thought I'd copy and paste it here.  


When I worked for the local Water Utility  and was doing deposits for new water service, a man came in filled out an application.  I did everything like I normally did.  Only issue was that their ID listed X as their Sex.  Weird, but it's 2020, I didn't ask any questions (because I picked up on the clues as to what it could mean).  At the very end of the process, I ran their Social # in our old system (per protocol, just to be sure I missed something in the new system).  Their social pulled up another name.  Not uncommon (typos), but warranted further research.  A lightbulb finally turned on: they were Trans and had legally made changes to reflect who they were.

Sadly, the right thing to do was to make them pay a new inflated deposit, and the old balance.  It was sizeable.  A couple hundred dollars.  I hated to tell him this, but I did.  However, I had a change of heart after I sent him up front to pay it.  Normally, we hold onto their documents and walk them up front, and they get them back at the front window after they pay.  Instead of relaying the balance to the cashiers, I ran up to him in the lobby (away from the ears of coworkers) and told him ""you know what, \[old name\] doesn't exist anymore.  Here's your ID, \[new name\].  Don't worry about the old balance.  You're all square with us.""  There was confusion, but a small smile.  I got a reserved ""thank you.""  I said you're welcome, and went back to work, not giving it a second thought.  I hope I made their day, but if not, I was always happy to figure out loophole to keep someone from paying hundreds of dollars for new water service.",38,0,0
“I never answer those seriously!” You what?,"For some background I work in auto/cycle insurance. Now I’m not sure if this is usual or not but we don’t have a department or team who really handles issues with customer’s online accounts. So it’s up to us CSRs to try to handle all that.

Man calls in upset that he can’t get into his online accounts. I verify him and immediately pull up the very limited info I can see in regards to his account.

Me: Well, sir the account is set up completely. Have you tried resetting the password?

Caller: Well, yeah! That’s why I’m calling! I can’t do it!!

M: Really? All it should do is have you answer the security questions you chose and answered when setting up the account. Is it not allowing you to do that?

C: Oh those? I don’t remember my answers. I never take those seriously! They’re so stupid so sometimes I pick questions that don’t apply to me. Sometimes I answer them with the last word in the question. And sometimes I make up whatever answer I want!

At this point my head is in my hands. I cannot believe what I’m hearing and struggling to comprehend why anyone in their right mind would do this.

M: Well, sir, I apologize but at this point there’s nothing I can do. I advise that you make a new account under a different email address.

C: What? No no no. You gotta be able to fix this! I don’t want to make a new account.

M: Sir, those security questions are there to help you get your account back. I don’t have access to those nor can I reset them.

We go back and forth for a bit with me having to reiterate that he essentially f*cked himself over in the sweetest and polite way possible. He eventually accepted defeat and hung up. 

TL;DR Man didn’t answer his security questions seriously and couldn’t get into his online account. I couldn’t fix it because those are suppose to help him get into the account.",585,0,0
Client doesn't want to pay over phone.,"Please tell me if this doesn't belong here.

This isn't my story, it's my husband's but I think it fits here.

He is an insurance broker. Not sure if it means the same thing everywhere but basically he is the middle man between the insurance company and the client. He takes care of dealing with the insurance so the client gets taken care of.

There is this one client that *no one* wants. It gets passed around constantly. Now it was his turn.

It was renewal time and he has done his job in negotiating a new contract. The client was happy and it was time to pay. This is where the issues start.

The client is a woman and she asks my husband to go to her so he can tell her the details on person (even tho she had them in writing). My husband goes and all she does is ask him personal questions (how old, if he is married, what he studied, if he is looking for another job) which made him uncomfortable.

So a few days after that in person meeting they are back to phone calls. He tries to get her to pay by having her give him their details and she refuses. Says she doesn't feel comfortable giving that info over phone. Asks if someone can go in person and retrieve the money, of course this isn't possible. She then asks if she can call the insurance company directly and pay them, which she can.

Everyone thinks that's the end. But no. Because she still has to give her info by phone to the insurance company. And. She. Doesn't. Want. To.

So she calls my husband again and he just doesn't want to deal with her because she makes him uncomfortable so another coworker deals with her. They talk and talk and she refuses to give out the info.

Boss asks what is taking so long because this is weeks worth of calls. They explain that she is now asking if she can log in into her system so she can input her details herself. They are so tired of her that the boss agrees to her insane request.

So she logs in and pays and now they have to change their details do she can't log in ever again.

Crazy thing? This wasn't an issue last year.",26,0,0

"These weeks Irate Callers, Sorted!","This week has been a stressful one. Is mercury in retrogade or something because LORD people have been acting crazy! These are the calls from this week, some mine, some coworkers: rated 5-thats messed up to 1-needed an extra offline break to reset my brain 

5. The Creep— This gentleman called and started giving me relaxation, breathing exercises and toe curling (?) techniques. Wouldn’t tell me what I could help him with, until I insisted FIRMLY. After helping him sort something in his account, he kept being all creepy. Followed by a “Thanks for the tips, I’m at work right now sk I’ll try those later. Thank you for calling X, you have a nice day. 

4-4. The Quadruple Dipper— This man called about 3-4 times, I know because when I said it in the company chat, other people came out and said they’d gotten him before me. He proceeded to say I was stupid and an idiot repeatedly right after my greeting.  Did I mispronounce something? I dont think so? Every question was answered with how much of an idiot I was and how I was stupid. Simply said my closings, and hung up. 

3-3. The Banshee’s Cousin— This lady called in and once asked to confirm her address, freaked out. A name and an account number does not cut it, since we send out a card that contain both, anyone could find the card, call in and pretend they’re the customer. So she began saying “Why are you asking me that? You have it in front of you?!” In a shrieking, almost deafening tone. To which my reply always remained more or less the same “It’s part of my job to confirm your address, the account number is not personal information, therefore it cannot be used to confirm your identity”. At one point, she paused, and I spoke, answering to her question, but apparently she wasn’t done, and when she started speaking again, the words had already left my mouth. This set her off even more: “WHY ARE YOU TALKING OVER ME?” To which my response is the truth “I apologize ma’am. Our phones lag sometimes and-“ “WELL WE PAY YOU ENOUGH TO GET BETTER PHONES!” This carried on and when she noticed I was not giving in, she proceeded to what I can only describe as putting the phone down and ignoring me? I said “Ma’am” multiple times in an effort to try and salvage the call, which ended in me stating That I was going to terminate the call, since I could not hear anyone on the other side, I had to still say my closing, but she grabbed the phone and clicked it off.  Can’t say I was mad she hung up. 

2-2. The Banshee— This lady called to state we were going to stop sending her so much mail. Of course I can help! I have a way of-NO MORE MAIL. Oh shit what happened there? Oh yes. She interrupted me. Just like that. I proceded to let her know that I had a way of making her receive just one letter-Aaaaand cut off again. “YES. JUST ONE LETTER”-she shrieked. I responded by saying “Ma’am, I need to read you this statement about how this is going to work.”  To which she said “Go ahead.” So I proceed to explain it once again: one letter when your account will expire, and if you have an email- “NOPE. NO EMAILS JUST A LETTER. ARE YOU CONFUSED OR SOMETHING?” This time I proceed to finish my statement-“an email will be sent as well, if the account expires, we will send a letter a month letter to let you know.”  She kept shrieking in what I can only assume was the Karen-est voice I have ever heard “I don’t care. You WILL stop sending me mail. YOU are GOING TO DO THAT AND I AM HANGING UP NOW.” I started another statement about how if she hangs up, I cant make any changes to her account beca-click. Oh, she hung up. Well, I can’t make changes in any account without the caller on the line. So guess who’s still receiving mail?

1-1. The Short Fuse— this man? Calls in, right after my greeting, starts asking me?/stating: “Are your agents-if your agents-I have been hung up on now TWICE, IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE TRAINED TO DO?!” I apologize, and offer my help, once again “I am so sorry sir, how can I help?” He’s not having it! “THIS IS THE SECOND TIME YOU ASK ME THAT AND YOU HAVE TO ANSWER MY QUESTION! Is that what you do?!” At this point he was yelling at the top of his lungs, and my hands were shaking uncontrollably. I let out a sigh, whithout noticing I hadn’t muted my mic, which meant...he’d heard me sigh into the mic. “WHAT WAS THAT? WHAT WAS THAT NOISE YOU JUST MADE?!....” he’s still screaming for a good 45 seconds straight after I muted myself to tell my Sup I was hanging up and gather their phone number to get them blacklisted. When I came back, He had finally shut up and was waiting a response from me from a “ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME OR NOT”, I unmute myself and barely get to say “Sir..” before he bursts out into yelling again, at this point I’m not even hearing words, so I state “Sir, In order for me to assist you I need for you to lower your voice and keep the conversation professional”, he never stopped yelling. I could HEAR the vein in his forehead about to pop. So I said my closing statement, and stated I was ending the call. Apparently, he HAD been hung up on before, because he kept yelling at other representatives and not let them try to assist. 

I ask myself every day, do these people understand that, we WILL keep dropping their calls, they wil NEVER get help or sort their problems out if they keep abusing the representatives? If you don’t corroborate your info, we can’t help, if you verbally abuse us, we WILL NOT help, and no matter how many times you call, you WILL be dropped. And eventually, your phone number will be sent to the Big Dick Bosses to blacklist. And then you will lose the service you liked, because you decided to be a raging pos. :) so Thank you for calling, and have a nice day, asshole.

But there was a block on the account that needed to be removed first.the fraud rep had a sassy rude like voice towards me and me alone and made me seem like a dumbass on the call with the customer on too. Good thing the calls are recorded and monitored. I reported her attitude to my supervisor. Yes i know i should have gotten more information thats my bad i will own my mistake. But will this easily be turned against me? I never went through this process. I just need advice and your positive opinions on this. This is my first job ever and i love it! But im afraid that she will turn it around on me. Any advice?,26,0,0

In which Mr. Customer got catfished... by a psychic,"More tales from the psychic line! 

One fine summer day, I take a call from a very angry customer. He’s been chatting for a long time with one of our psychics... and not on our line. He’s been a very bad boy, and now he’s mad because Psychic Mary confessed that she’s really Psychic Mark. 

“I told her things about me that I’ve never told anyone else and then she tells me she’s really a man!” he laments as I try not to cackle in his ear. Who uses a psychic hotline as a dating service?

“We had really intimate conversations!”

Now, this is obviously against the rules, as phone sex wasn’t the goal of that side of the business (like it was on the other), but it’s also not allowed for the customer and psychic to trade personal information for obvious reasons. So many rip off artists out there, and we had our share of them - some of which I’ll share sooner or later. 

“She always sounded so hot!” he says with an obvious pout. 

So I let him know we’ll get our “fraud team” on it, which was really just a small handful of guys who handled the IT for the operation. 

He then demands we reimburse him “for false advertising”, which I had to mute him and laugh about. Once composed, I let him know that his decision to speak to Psychic Mary on his own time is not the responsibility of the company and is absolutely against our guidelines, as is phone sex with the psychic. He demands the refund of his last two legit calls. I deny him, as does a supervisor, and tell him I’ll send the request on to the fraud team. 

He calls me a few names, says he’ll trash our reputation to everyone (because a psychic hotline is such a classy, respectable business anyway), and he’ll never be a customer again. 

I could end it there, it’s funny enough, but I can’t do that to y’all when I know there’s a cherry to be put on top of this hot mess sundae. 

A few days later, one of the IT guys comes up to me laughing. He proceeds to tell me that they suspended Psychic Mary’s access to the line. She finally called in to see why she couldn’t get any customers. 

He says, “Well, is this Psychic Mary or is this Psychic Mark?”

She hung up and was never heard from again.",81,0,0
Enter Key,"Alright short and simple...

My first Saturday working in a small internet service provider call center I was there by myself, I was super nervous since I was by myself for the first one in the history of that job.

My first caller is this really elderly person who can't get their email. I know what the fix is but I know that I can't walk them through this on the phone. I get them to open a web page, and am trying to get them to our website so I can do a remote assistance and....... It took me 20 minutes to explain where the ""enter"" key is on their keyboard. There's 2 of them. 20 minutes. Once they hit enter they're at the page and I do what I need in 2 minutes.... 

And that's when I knew how my time in a call center was going to go...",16,0,0
"This is our worst Karen. There are many like her, but this one is ours.","Every company probably has that ONE customer. The one that collectively gets on everyone's nerves, no matter which department. 

Well, Karen is ours. 

Now, we have plenty of Karens, don't get me wrong. But this Karen is the Karenest of all the Karens.

* When Karen calls in, she is most of the time already at 70 and can go to 100 at a moment's notice. Simply asking her questions to help better understand her issue or request will set this bitch off. 
* Has anyone here watched The Good Place? She's Elanor Shellstrop, pre-character development. Maybe worse.
* In my years of customer service, I have never put a client on hold without telling them I'm about to do so. Not one. Except her. The first time was an accident because it was the first time I'd spoken to her, and she went from speaking in a somewhat rushed but civil tone to SUDDENLY SCREAMING AND CURSING within a hundredth of a second. Scared the bejesus out of me and my hand slipped. Second time she pulled that shit, I put her on hold right as she started screeching.
* If you don't understand her issue, question, or who she needs to speak to by the first words that come out of her mouth, she's already insulting your intelligence and telling you you don't know what you're talking about, or just screaming at you suddenly with no warning or provocation.
* The woman has a bunch of escalations to managers because whenever she's in a mood (which is 98% of the time), she is nigh impossible to work with and just seems like she'd rather bitch and complain and tell you you don't know anything rather than just calm the fuck down and explain. 
* The other 2% of the time.....she's actually in a civil mood. I don't know what it is, but there's been a FEW calls people have had where Karen is actually not acting like you're the slave who's failed her and she's mad that state laws prevent her from having you flogged. We just assume she took her meds that day.
* She's one of those who demands a call for *everything* to the point where it defies logic. Sure, we're happy to give you a call, but if you aren't there, we're leaving a voicemail and following up via email. This woman will demand a call, not pick up the phone, and then call into the main line hours later ready to slit throats because someone dared send her an email to try and see when she'd be available. 

Nearly everyone in the company hates her because she treats everyone like garbage, but none of the higher ups will take action against her because she technically hasn't insulted people *directly,* or used abusive language *directed* at us. 

She's apparently allowed to be a screaming, difficult asshole as long as she's not directing abuse at the person on the phone....though, our definitions of ""abusive"" seem to be a bit skewed in my opinion. Our immediate managers are actually on our side with this one just based on how she treats people and how many pointless escalations she gets in, but at this point, my bitter mind is assuming she's blowing the higher ups in charge of actually doling out punishments to the clients who go too far.

Oh well. I just work here.",126,0,0
The Tale Of Ms. K.......AKA How To Make Everyone You Speak With Hate You.,"Let me tell you a story of Ms. K. I am not using her full name, although I could for reasons that I'll explain later.  This took place a few years ago. 

Let me give you some context. 

I work at an online bank in the Technical Department (which means I deal with old people all day long that don't know the difference between a search engine and a browser). I also help out our Core team, which is the general help line for people who just have questions for us. No big deal, right? 

Nope. 

We had a caller that for the sake of anonymity we will call Ms. K. Now Ms. K was one of those customers that made everyone she talked to angry, and I do mean everyone. We even started an office wide joke about her whenever someone had the displeasure of getting her. 

So what made her so bad? 

In a typical work day, a banker would talk to between 25 and 50 people, and most people would call in once or twice in order to get an issue fixed. 

Not Ms. K. She would call in between 2 and 12 times A DAY (Her record was 16 times in one day). She would always ask the exact same question to us, and we would give her the exact same story that the other people gave her. When she said that we were wrong, she would hang up, and call back later to ask the same question. Every. Single. Day. 

The other problem was that she had been with our company since 2013, and it only got really bad at the end of 2016. She would make hundreds of calls a year to ask us the exact same question. 

The question she wanted to know was when her bank statement would come in. Now keep in mind that we had monthly statements that was sent out to everybody, she never knew what month of the statement that she wanted, and when would tell her that a copy was already sent out, she would tell at us that we didn't because she never received it, and hang up. 

The other huge issue we had with her was she was elderly, super confrontational to the point of it almost seeming like a joke, racist to certain members of the bank, and she most likely had dementia. The reason I say that is when she would call back, she claimed to have no memory of any of the calls she made that day, or any days previous. Whenever we would tell her that she already called in 15 minutes ago to ask us for a copy of her bank statement, she would deny ever talking to us, get mad and yell at us, and hang up again. It got to be so bad that the team that was responsible for sending out letters refused to send any to her because she would ask for several of the same form every day. 

You can see why nobody liked dealing with her, but after what felt like an eternity dealing with this woman, something incredible happened. 

She stopped calling. 

It happened out of nowhere. One day she was yelling at us, the next day not a peep from her. It was heaven. The next day she didn't call in, and the day after that, and the day after that, and on and on. We didn't hear from her for over 8 months. Some had forgot about her, some thought she was moved into a home away from a phone, and some thought she died. As for me, I was just happy to not deal with her. 

She called two more times after 8 months of no contact, and I was so shocked to hear her voice I almost fell out of my chair. After those two calls, she never called us back. That was back in 2018, and in a strange way, I almost miss it a bit. At least she was consistent. 

TL;DR Old bitch calls us multiple times a day for years to berate and belittle our staff, when she suddenly disappears, and only returns just to disappear again.",22,0,0
Today a patient asked to speak with my supervisor...,"... so he could give her his compliments on my customer service and let her know I'm doing an excellent job.

I've only been at this job for 2 months and I don't feel super confident in my skills yet. I was totally expecting the worst when he asked that because I wasn't really able to help him and all I could do was send a message to someone else so they could call him back. But I reassured him that his issue would be looked into and taken care of, so I guess I did something right.

Enjoy the small things,"So here I am sitting at my desk, taking calls at 9 am this morning and wishing I wasn't, and in comes angry lady. Now the company I work for and the service we provide and such isn't relevant to this story but this woman lives on the east coast, NY CT area which I tend to get more rude customers from than any other area so im already thrilled to take this call, but I kept a good tone nonetheless. I ask for her address and she rattles off the address faster than lightning. I managed to hear the street number and that is was avenue but I didn't quite understand the street name because of how fast she said it and being on a call center headset, (also the street name turned out to be Quinnipiac, cmon throw me a bone lady)  So I ask her ""what was the street name ma'am? What ave?"" To which she replies in the most annoyed east coast voice you can think of ""Jesus fucking christ, I guess I have to spell it"" So she slowly starts ""Q... U...I...  ... umm hang on its QUI let me see where did I put it dammit"" *queue 30 seconds of paper rustling* ""Q..u..i..n..n..i..p..i..a..c, you got it?"" So in my best customer service voice I say ""yes ma'am, thank you for finding that for me, I just want to make sure I'm providing you accurate information for your address""

I always love situations like that, dont get upset at me for not knowing the address if you dont even know how to spell it. Gave me a good laugh. Gotta enjoy the little things guys! Hope you all get good calls today and make lots of money!",23,0,0
"Sure, I’ll get a manager on the line immediately. Click *Hangs Up* I quit.","So I quit my job at the Home Warranty Company. I’m tired of the technicians that work with us not answering there phone and not being reliable. What type of technicians go to someone’s house and doesn’t send us a diagnosis for weeks or just go ghost on the customers and us? Then the customers get on the phone yelling at me because of technician is not answering. But when they do answer, it’s a high chance they are rude, unprofessional or confused. 

The technicians are just a percentage of why this job is a nightmare. Every customer is angry. Out of 150 calls per day with customers, 25 don’t have attitudes, rude, or yelling. I had enough. The last few days my performance has been horrible and I have been giving the energy they give me back to them. 

You want to cancel? “Let me transfer you to retention”. 

Asking me the same question after I told you several times? “What don’t you understand? Did you not hear me the first time sir/mam? Like I said...!”

We never cover anything and we are a scam? “Well didn’t you read the policy you bought?”

Raising your voice at me? I’ll yell back. I DON’T CARE! 

The last straw was with one guy. Every customer ask for a supervisor when they don’t like the rules, but we are not allowed to transfer or put in a request if it’s not a valid reason or reason is clearly stated in the policy. 

Me: Thank you for calling ... May I have your address?

Customer: I need to speak to a supervisor. Last person said they would transfer me and hung up.

Me: Um, well I would have to pull your account up first and look into your request? ...... Thank you, and what’s the reason you would like to speak to a supervisor.

Customer: I want to speak to a supervisor. 

Me: Like I said, I would need to have a reason for-

Customer: I don’t have to explain anything to you.

(As I look into his account, claim was denied. Reason stated in policy.)

Me: Well if you are referring to the claim that was denied you put in, you would have to submit an appeal- 

Customer: That’s not what I’m calling for, I need to speak to a supervisor. 

Me: Ok, well your not speaking to a supervisor. I’m not able to transfer you. Is there anything else I can help you with. 

Customer: So your telling me I can’t speak to a supervisor? What do you mean your not able to, the other rep said they would. 

Me: Well did they transfer you? ... No. The managers are busy, I’ll put in a request for a call back. 

Customer: I don’t want a call back. How hard is it to get up and put the phone to the Supervisors ear?!

Me: We are actually working from home so that’s not possible. 

Customer: Well I’m not getting off the phone until there’s a supervisor. 

Me: Like I said I-... you know what? I get a you over to a manager right now, one moment.

Customer: Yeah you bett-

Call center nurses have a warped sense of humor.,I was working for a health system nurse advice line (think Dial-a-Nurse) as a RN. There were about 30 nurses on staff but at that time I was the only male. Most of the nurses were older and well experienced and most of us had worked in Emergency Rooms. At any given time there would be 6 to 8 of us on duty and answering the calls. Please understand that nurses in general and especially ER nurses tend to develop a weird sense of humor. It helps them to handle the stresses of literally dealing with life and death situations on a daily basis. I had taken medical leave to have prostate surgery which was followed by complications causing me to miss close to a month of work. All of my co-workers knew why I had been gone. As I walked into the call center I was warmly greeted with a question of “Hey man. What’s up?” which was a barely disguised double entendre. Without missing a beat I replied “Everything except me ever since the surgery.” I got a good round of laughs for my quick comeback.,94,0,0
Put me through to one of your female colleagues!,"So... I just returned from a year of paternity leave (possible if still a bit rare in my country) and was back working for a tech support hotline, when the phone rang.

Me: Hello, JimLongbow speaking, how can I help you?

To which a middle-aged female voice said:  ""Put me through to one of your female colleagues. ""

I was taken a little aback but took a page out of the manual from said female colleagues, who were sitting right next to my desk. We were all really annoyed by those sexist calls - even if they are usually in the other direction and always find a way to pay back the customer, if not in this call, then the next.

Me: ""I'm sorry, they are currently not available (a lie), but please describe the technical issue and maybe I can help you. For that , please give me your company name and your name, please."" In the sweetest, most inoffensive voice I could muster.

Her: ""hrmpf OK."" 

She then starts rattling down her company name, her name and the problem and I dutifully typed it in.

And then it came:

Her:  You type pretty fast....**for a man**.

Oh how I've waited for a line like that.

Me: ""Why, thank you! But that's slow. I was a lot faster before my 12-month paternity leave"".

My colleagues, who were by then listening in to my half of the conversation, had to stifle a laugh.

But You. Could. Hear. A. Pin Drop. on the other side of the line (the sound her jaw made when it dropped to the floor was positively ear-shattering). A guy taking care of the kid did not fit into her view of the world at all!

Her: \[Stammering\] Uhm.. OK.. Congratulations then! 

And she suddenly was so much friendlier than before. 

The phone call wrapped up shortly after that. I gave her some first-aid tips based on the issue she described, asked for some files to be emailed to us and hung up.  

I turned to my female colleagues and told them, that  now, for the first time ever, I really, really understand how annoying those calls can be (and then went to get myself a well-deserved coffee)!",928,0,0
I want our phone working so people can still reach my dead husband. Can you waive it for free?,"Me = Me, of course lol

Cx = Customer (the wife)

Ret = Retentions Department

Bil = Billing Department

==================

Me: Hello, you're through to BEEP company. My name is ME. How may I help?

Cx: Oh, hi. I spoke with a gentleman yesterday about my account. I was asking for a discount so I can renew my phone but I haven't heard back yet. Can you check it for me?

Me: Sure thing. May I have your phone number or reference ID, please?

(Took a bit while to get her information. Turns out that she only has the billing statement. I got her account, no worries.)

Cx: So you see, I was billed for $20.00 for 1 year last year. My husband passed away (she started sobbing here) and money's a bit too tight due to COVID and stuff. I was hoping if you can offer me the same discount from the previous year so I wouldn't pay for $120 this year. I only want to keep our phone working so people can still reach my husband. It would be very nice if you waive it for free. Just for this year.

Me: My condolences, ma'am. I see there's a case opened for you and that it's being reviewed by Ret. You will hear from them once your request is processed.

Cx: Can't you do it from me? I mean, you do understand, right?

Me: I do. But I'm in no position decide for discounts as you've reached our general hotline. What I can do, however, is relay your information so maybe they can give you another exception as courtesy.

Cx: I appreciate that. (and then she goes again with the story and that she has no money)

Days later she calls again. She was offered for 10% discount as that's the best we can only give to our customers. Obviously, she declined and pleaded again to have the same discount or give it for free (like heck no lol)

I just serve as a messenger at this point but I was able to ask Bil to reactivate the line for 24 hours just for her. This went on for days and I'm going bananas. This woman is literally asking for something unreasonable.

Ret was eventually able to give the discount she asks but she calls again.

Cx: I'm calling in about the discount I asked for. I thought I will be given the service for free?

Me: Ma'am, if I'm not mistaken, you requested for a discount.

Cx: I did, but why can't you give it for free? My husband passed away, why can't you just give it to me? Just for this year. It's all I ask. (she starts to cry again from the background)

Me: I hope you also understand that we also need to cover the fees to keep the lines open. The discount we honored is the lowest we can apply so you can pay for your phone.

Cx: (she clicks her tongue out of dismay) Well, can you ask Ret if they can waive it for now? I just don't know when I'll be able to pay.

Me: I can request for a payment extension if that's what you need.

She eventually gives in and will be waiting for Ret's reply but I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

Background: The phone wasn't really the husband's phone because there's less to no usage on it at all and based from the statements she provided, she was using it for her work not her husband. She was basically using her husband as an excuse to get a discount.",54,0,0

Incompetence,"The title really says it all. 

Lady calls in, and isn't mad. Or angry. Just confused. And I get why, she was refunded a not so insubstantial amount and she still had a balance afterwards. 

And I know why. We  calculate interest on a per diem basis. This can save people money in the long run, but it also leads to fuckery where people pay off the balance and then get charged interest and don't realize they have it. I do my level best to ensure that anyone paying of their balance either accounts for said interest or at least is aware it'll pop up when the bill cycles over. 

This though, was special. On a payment plan, with payments all scheduled. She pays the balance off towards the end. She still has payments scheduled. Anyone with a quarter of a brain cell can figure out ""ah, yeah, we should cancel those"". Nah, that day, Fuckstick took the balance, and didn't cancel the payments. So she gets charged.

No big deal, we refund it. Except for the fact, per diem interest. She carried a balance for a few days. So, the day, the exact same fucking day, we refund the not canceled payment, and then put the interest on the account. I'm blown the fuck away. I'm apologizing. I'm just stunned at the chain of fuckery. I actually went stupid. 

I call the help desk. Shout out to the homie who picked up. He reminds me customer service can reverse interest charges if the bank is at fault. And we are. Call customer service. I explain. They say ""I'll get this fixed immediately"". Customer is happy. 

This should never have been an issue. But it was. Because people are dumb. I just needed to vent, sorry if this isn't all that entertaining.",42,0,0

In my job I get a lot of opportunity to see my clients as human beings, it is part and parcel of the job, but this was a rare moment where we were both just regular people sad about a celebrity death together.

She was awesome, btw, after I solved all her questions she said I was the best rep she had ever talked too, but I really think it was because she saw me as an actual factual human being.

Just because we ask that your husband is also present doesn't make us a semester company ma'am.,"Long time lurker, first time posting.

I work part time in the call center of a home improvement sales company near my house. We sell things like windows, roofing, siding, etc. It's a small family owned company that has an A+ rating on BBB. Very tough to get in our industry. We maintain that rating by educating both home owners on the products out there and answer any and all questions they might have.

A couple Friday evenings ago, I was closing up shop with a coworker (Cody).

Cody called a woman that had reached out to get a free estimate on her roof and some windows to be replaced. The call was going well until he asked for her husband to be present for the meeting as well. That's when all hell broke loose.

This woman began a verbal tirade on Cody saying that we were a sexist company for requiring that a man had to be present for the appointment. As if she can't make any decisions for herself. She kept speaking over Cody and interrupting him and basically having a temper tantrum over the phone.

After nearly 5 minutes of this, Cody finally snapped and raised his voice on her and politely told her to shut up and let him talk. 

The reason why we require both people to be there is because it's an important decision on the house that they'll be making together. We like to send a rep out just 1 time to the house, so we want to make sure everyone is on the same page. Often times, the husband will ask a question that the wife doesn't think about, or vice versa. We want to make sure that everyone understands the product and the quote. Especially when it comes to picking the color. We have gotten bad reviews in the past because the husband picked a color that the wife didn't like and we had to go back out and fix the complaint. We are conscientious about our rating and want to maintain the A+ BBB.

On top of that, having both husband and wife there eliminates the ""I need to talk to my spouse before making a decision"" excuse to not buy.

This lady was not understanding this and was just assuming that we won't go out just because she's a woman and she'd be the one making the decision. Cody even told her that we say the same thing if a man tries to schedule. He challenged her to have her husband call in under a false name and he'll get the same response if he tried to schedule without her being there.

Rough Call,"It's the end of the night and I'm placing an order for a very pissed off woman who wouldn't stop telling me how terrible our company is for having some things out of stock, how the choices are horrible etc etc. In the background I can hear a kid. All of a sudden she starts screaming at the child and I can hear her spanking the kid. Loud thwacks and a child screaming. While I sit in silence. After she's done she hurls another insult at me.

"You Can Run, But You Can't Hide!","I work as a technical support/escalated call handler for an insurance call center. I work the late night shift. Most of my calls are helping reps navigate the ins and outs of various insurance contracts. One of my ***many*** duties of this job is helping reps to understand underwriting criteria. This is to make sure we're charging the correct amount on the policy. Often, this means you the consumer will not be getting good news from my rep or from me. This instance I'm about to share is no exception.

Cast of Characters: Me, Rep, Sir Shady (SS moving forward)

Me: Technical Support, this is mentalgopher, how may I help you today?

Rep: Hi, do you have the policy for SS coming up?

Me: Yeah, what's going on with it?

Rep: He's upset about his premium being so high. He thinks we're charging him more because we don't have correct information on the policy, so we can't verify his license number.

Me (Reviewing policy): The information that he filled in when he purchased this policy online? I mean, sure we can correct it. But I can't guarantee that it'll be cheaper when corrected.

While I'm reviewing, I discover a second policy. One where SS was added to the policy by our claims department. SS had been added onto his parents' policy. On his own policy, SS had put in the wrong date of birth, the wrong issuing state for his license (but the right number!), the wrong zip code (but right address), and had left off all other household family members, including some who operated the insured vehicle. Oh, and the parents' policy had cancelled with a balance owing of over $2,000.

(Important nugget: Most insurance companies require that you include everybody in the household of driving age on the policy. Theoretically, there's access to the vehicles in the household. And even if you've never driven a day in your life, you may still have coverage rights under the policy by virtue of being a resident relative. This can vary by carrier, and policy contracts may address this differently among carriers.)

Rep comes back and states the customer wants to change the date of birth and license state. He will not consent to the update in the address. She runs it and we are looking at an increase of over $4,000 to the term. Turns out SS had the kind of driving record that begs for exclusive use of public transportation.

Me: You sure he's going to be okay with this amount and this change, Rep?

Rep: Yeah, he's being really cool about it.

I don't smell a rat; I smell a full outhouse next to the beach during low tide. I make a mental note to follow up on the policy for the next three weeks. Because the insured had refused to update the address, this was an automatic referral to Underwriting, anyways.

Lo and behold, I check on the policy for the first time the next day. The customer has purchased a ***third*** policy with all the wrong information input. The rate is on par with his pre-corrected rate. He had purchased it online while on the phone with my rep, then called back two hours later to cancel the new policy.

One of my pet peeves is insurance fraud/material misrepresentation. I really hate when they do it repeatedly. Not that I don't appreciate the attempts at giving me job security, but insurance fraud is something that hurts EVERYBODY.

I ended up having to kick this up to Underwriting's management. They didn't mess around; SS got the ""Don't let the door hit you on your way out, and don't bother coming back"" notice three days later. He didn't even bother calling us back. No one grieved this loss.",27,0,0
I mailed it in!,"The US Postal Service is a great organization with lovely people who do a hard job for little to no thanks (seriously y'all, say hi and thank you to the postman or postwoman when you see them, they do hard work). Which is why I feel bad that so many irresponsible nerdburgers blame them for their payment not getting to us. 

Now, I understand how people like to write checks. It FEELS like you're paying the bill. Tactile sensation is great. That's why I write a physical check when I send in an electronic one and then void it. Because I'm not fucking around with my bills. Cause I'm an adult. Who totally wears pants everyday, and I never say fuck it and kill a whole thing of Oreos. 

Anyways, I'm having a ball today, nothing but long calls, transfers, and fuck ups by other people in the company. A day where I want to hate every caller, but I can't because every single one of them isn't even an asshole. They're just rightfully miffed that someone fucked the whole thing up, or they are calling from the hospital. Can't these assholes just be assholes and let me riff on them?! Goddammit, stupid empathy. 

Anyways, I'm just sitting there, getting angry at my walls because I just needed to be angry at something, a hero came. Not the hero you want, but dammit did I need this hero. This fucking legend calls in about a late fee. From over a month ago. She has had 3 other late fees reversed this year. 

And this lady was just awful. Shes yelling about late fees and how she mailed the check and blah blah blah. And I  needed this call. My eyes were rolling so much I could power the continental US if they hooked me up to a dynamo. I didn't even bother being nice and apologetic. No, I was blunt. I was honest. I didn't pull a single (verbal) punch. 

""Well ma'am, we received the check late.""

""I mailed the payment [day before due date]! It's not *my* fault you didn't get the check. And I'm a great customer, with [high balance bank acct] and [other high balance bank acct], and you're going to treat me like this?!""

""I'm sorry that you're not understanding me...""

""No no, I'm a *very* smart person, and I have no trouble understanding that you don't value a great customer"" At this point, my eyes are literally just going in circles, I'm getting dizzy. 

""Ma'am, you mailed it [day before due date], correct?""

""That's what I said!""

""Did you overnight it to us?""

""What? I don't know how it got sent, I gave it to someone else to mail""

My eyes are now rolling so fast I'm worried that I'm gonna start zooming around my office. 

""Ma'am, the payment was late. I'm not removing that late fee, or the others because you haven't paid *since* your late payment"". 

""You WILL remove them or I want to talk to your supervisor"" 

""Understood ma'am, I'll get you to a supervisor""

""(Dumb dumb bitch noises)""

And then explained the situation, professionally, to the escalations person, conferenced the call, wished them both a goodnight, and hung up. My eyes, finally freed from the endless loop, started to hurt. I took some tough calls after, but god did it feel fucking good to have someone who unequivocally fucking *deserved* to be hated.",69,0,0

"Jesus, what part of “Final Sale” do you not understand???","So at my job we have a policy of “don’t tell the customers no” EXCEPT when it comes to face masks.  We are not allowed to accept returns on face masks.  We can send new ones out if they are defective but we are instructed to let the customers keep the masks and there are no returns on masks.  So today I got this call:

Mask Lady “Hi, I need to make a return, order xxxxx”

Me “Okay great.  Oh I’m so sorry I see this is all face masks, unfortunately we are unable to return those”

Mask Lady “what do you mean? I got some on Amazon for $14, I don’t want these I want a refund”

Me “Oh I’m sorry masks are final sale and we cannot accept returns on them”

Mask Lady “But I want to return them”

Me “again I’m so sorry but when you purchased them you had to acknowledge they were final sale and no returns would be made”

Mask Lady “but I got some on Amazon for cheaper, I don’t want these, I want to return them”

Me, “again, I am so sorry but we cannot accept these, they are final sale.”

Mask Lady “what is final sale?? I want to RETURN them”

Me “again ma’am I understand what you want, unfortunately there is nothing I can do for you, we CANNOT accept returns on masks.

Mask Lady “well what am I supposed to do with these?”

Me “well you can definitely use them.  Is there anything else I can help you with?”

Mask Lady “well what am I supposed to do??”

After 7 MINUTES of this I finally just gave up and kept repeating how sorry I was and repeating the policy.

After I got off the phone my husband piped up from downstairs “ma’am? I would like to return some masks!” And I threw a shoe at him.",1295,0,0
The tale of lady who doesn’t understand why pointing a gun at a technician might get the guy to leave and not come back.,"I had quite the call today. Lady calls in shouting that she’s been on hold for over an hour and she’s so glad she finally reached a person. I thought maybe she was just eccentric and went along with it. She spouts off her info at me, luckily her account came up. I start asking her what’s going on. She starts asking me when her technician is showing up to fix her TV. Not my department, but sure, I’ll look. No tech visit scheduled. I tell her I’m going to take a look at the notes real quick. 

OMG. There are so many notes from yesterday. The whole time she’s shouting at me about her issues. I’m trying to listen to her and read these notes. What I’m reading is insane. Basically her TV wasn’t working right so she had to call a technician because she refused to unplug her TV box and try even the slightest amount of troubleshooting over the phone. Then when the tech shows up he sees a gun on her table. Okay, not illegal, but not making anyone comfortable either. So he’s taking a look at it and I guess texts his supervisor about the situation. His supervisor tells him to leave. He let’s her know that he has to go because of this. She grabs the gun and starts threatening him to fix her TV box. He leaves quickly. So she starts calling and telling the people she’s getting on the phone a totally different story, our security team gets involved and locks her account. 

So I ask her what happened and if security has reached out to her. She is not admitting anything. Finally I had to say “ma’am, did you point a gun at the technician? Because that’s why we can’t send anyone.” She goes “oh that? Everyone here has guns, I don’t know what his problem is. I need my tv box fixed. I pay you people so much money each month and he just left without doing anything.” No shit lady. Most people don’t want to potentially be shot while at work. She then starts going on about her friend is going to come over and they are going to start a war. And then she’s telling me her friend took all her guns so I need to send someone out. Nope, can’t do that. 

I ended up just reaching out to a sup and telling her I need her to take over this call. I had to take a few minutes after that call. Not because I was worried or upset, but just in disbelief that people like her exist. ‘Murcia.",1373,0,0

To smoosh or not to smoosh,"I was hired on to my first call center in 06 after moving to Florida thanks to Hurricane Katrina in 05. It was, and this is no joke, a phone sex/voice personals AND psychic hotline. 

I have so many stories. 

It’s definitely important that I make it clear I did not work as a psychic or a phone sex operator (the former worked from home, the latter worked in an adjacent office). I was customer service, but I did not service the customer, if you follow me. Also, I only ever was a CSR for the psychic line, but I did do QA for the voice personals, which was another level of fun, but isn’t relevant here. 

And if you think we had some weird ass calls, you’d be right. This is probably my favorite. 

I get this regular who was known for being super kooky (shocker, I know), but really sweet. She’s really excited because she’s on a date (yes, like right now) and wants some advice about how to proceed. She then tells me to wait a second. I hear doors closing and locking before she comes back on. 

“Okay, now that I’m hiding in my bathroom, I really need advice. I need to know if I should sleep with him or not!”

Big whoa. Seriously? But we were not allowed to judge or say anything negative to them, so I promptly start looking at the available list of psychics while chatting her up about the date, looking for the perfect love guru to help this woman decide if she’s gonna get deep dicked or not. 

I find a suitable match, wish her luck, and send her off. 

A week-ish later one of my coworkers told me she called in later to get relationship advice about the same guy and the customer said that he was amazing in bed.",62,0,0
Rinse and repeat....,"I work for a popular roadside assistance companies and just thought I'd share a call I got today that irked me to my soul.

Me:  Thank you for calling roadside assistance company.  My name is noodles. How can I help?

C:  Yeah I see my bill went up to $100. Last year it was $50 so I don't see why it's so high now.

Me:  OK I can see what's going on there.

* Goes through basic verification and pulls up account*

Me:  So last year I see we were able to give you a promotion that let you have the 2nd person on your account free.  However that is a one time promotions so there is a charge to have that person on this year.

C:  Well I have the bill from last year and it's not showing that we had someone free.

Me:  We sent out the bill with the total amount you would have been charged then when you called in to make the payment we applied the free discount for you. 

C:  This bill from last year is showing that we were charged for the 2nd person. The coverage is all the same so why has it gone up this year?

Me:  Yes that bill was sent out before we applied the free discount. When you actually went to pay we did not charge you for the 2nd person.

C:  Ma'am I'm looking at the bill you guys sent me from last year and I see that you charged for the 2nd person. 

Me:  The bill does not indicate what we actually charged.  When you called in and paid we gave you the discount making the 2nd person free. It was a one time.

C:  No you did charge for the 2nd person. None of the coverage changed so my bills should only be $50.

Me:...... Sir I'm not going to argue. I've already explained why that bill says that. Now if your concerned about the cost for the membership we have lower memberships that are cheaper.

C: NO!  We had this exact same coverage last year so there's no reason for the price to increase!

Me: Since the 2nd person was free last year and that was a one time promotion your bill comes out to $100.

C:  No it doesn't! Is there a supervisor?

Me: Sure

"Customer thinks that by threatening to give me a bad review, I'm going to suddenly give him a solution","TLDR this guy's booking got declined because his cc was invalid (it was a 10.88 USD booking.....) and no payment was collected so his hotel booking was cancelled FOC by the hotel - same situation with one of my earlier posts on here basically. Told him to rebook, we can't guarantee the same prices as his original bc we don't control the prices and its based on realtime..

He wanted a solution, I said it wasn't possible - no payment was collected. The only issue here is that I cannot give him the same price again, he'll have to try his luck and check the prices on his end... From what I know the prices are different for every user. No one in our CS understands the algorithm so we just say it depends on how frequent you book with us but the app provides cheaper prices than the website for sure.

Then guy got mad because at first I said it was confirmed when he asked for the status. When I checked our supplier's frontend, it was cancelled free of charge. Basically we didn't know our supplier initiated a cancellation and it was still active on our backend and frontend....  So I told him yeah I rechecked the hotels emails to you and they cancelled due to invalid cc... 

I was trying to explain this to him but he wouldn't listen at first. I don't remember what he said but he just wouldn't listen so I gave up and didn't listen to what he was saying unless I heard something I could reply to..

Customer: Then what are you doing.. what is your job.

Me: I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.

Customer: What is your function. What do you do. What is your job.

Me: I'm sorry, I don't get you

Customer: (HEAVY SIGH) You said my booking was confirmed just now, and then you said that it has been cancelled. I'm confused.

Me: I do apologise for the confusion, I was trying to explain it to you but you wouldn't let me, sir.

Customer: Okay, then explain

Me: Your booking was confirmed on our end, which was why I had informed you that the booking has been confirmed. After checking again on our hotel's end when you let us know that the hotel had cancelled it, we found that it was cancelled on their end- 

Customer: Ok but thats not my problem. I had it confirmed. I updated my card twice

Me: [trying to explain but constantly getting cut off x10]

Customer: [babbling away &amp; im not registering what hes saying at all]

Karen Block A Corporate Card (Again): An Update,"So you guys may remember this Karen from a previous tale ([here](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/ehpf18/when_karen_sends_a_member_of_the_armed_forces_to/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)). 

Well she's back.This was relayed to me by a good friend who still works there. 

Apparently this friend (whom I trained) noticed that Karen had blocked another corporations control (credit) card. Meaning no employees could use their card for business expense.

How the cards work in this particular business is if a business wants 10 for 10 employees (1 each) the business is given a control card on which all expenses are added on. This way instead of paying 10 different cards the business is able to pay off just one card; the control card which has all the expenses added together.

Now if you freeze/block one of the cards that is **not** the control card other employees card whose card hasn't been frozen would still work. **But** if you stop the control card nobody in that business will be able to use their card.

So here is my friend (we will call her Stacy) about to call a card holder as there were transactions on the card the bank wanted to make sure was the card holder that was the one making these payments.

Stacey notices however, that there is a block on the control card and the card holder has been referred to branch. After some further digging Stacey notices that it was Karen who placed a block on the control card. And given Karen's track record (see previous post) this was not accidental.

So Stacey removes the block on the control and calls the card holder to verify the payment (they were genuine). Stacey had to also report Karen to management. 

It turns out Karen is moving into another dept. where the manager is friendly but also the type to bring a tonne of bricks if you ever fuck up. Will be fun to see what happens with her.

Excited to be starting at a call center this monday,"Here's a little background about who I am: 

I have 8 years of experience in IT/Tech support. I have a few years experience in retail and working at random stores. I'm joining a call center/customer service for a b2b ecommerce website and what they do already seems up my alley. I'm currently at Best Buy and when we were on lock down we had to man the phones, and I quite enjoyed it. I feel getting stuff shipped out properly or fixing order problems is a bit different mentality than dealing with angry end users who want their computers fixed. I also feel since I'm not the sole person in charge of everything like I was at my IT gigs, I know it's not my fault and I'm not who they are angry at! 

I'd be in an order processing roll taking on emails/chats then phone calls. Supposedly new reps can learn the systems in less than three weeks then we work from home. Everyone from the team lead to the head of customer service has told me that my experience will work well there.

Call center agent did not violate company policy by telling me what the company policy was,"Some years ago when 3D was the Next Big Thing, I had a camera system that I flew around with to productions and rental houses. The rig was designed to be airline friendly so it could travel as checked luggage. The main rig case was just under 70 lbs, one of the airline cutoff weights.

I was slated to fly from SFO to Vancouver BC, pick up the system and then fly to Toronto. There was an airline we always used because they are Media Friendly. i.e. we paid $50 per bag no matter the weight, size or how many. That is way cheaper than shipping. They just had to meet airline regulations for max size and be under 100lbs.

The leg of the trip from Vancouver to Toronto was to be on a partner airline instead of the usual airline. Hmmm, I check their bag policies and see some trouble coming.  I call their call center and get a wonderful Canadian agent. After going over the issue I learn that the rampies for that airline won't touch anything over 50lbs in Toronto. We both agreed I can't fly with them and I had to cancel the reservation.

I then tell her that I'm not real familiar with the various airlines that go across Canada and is there another airline that does the Van - Toronto route.

She responded with, ""I'm sorry but it is the policy of Big Airline Company to not tell customers about Other Smaller Airline.""

I thanked her and rang off. Then called OSA and got a nice flight with Media rate for the gear and a total lower fare.

You will note that she did not violate the company policy by telling me about the other airline, she simply told me the company policy. Perhaps a bit of malicious compliance on her part.

What Did You Just Say?,"I’ve been in the call center world for just about three and a half months, training included. After the movie theater I worked at shut down (thanks 2020), I browsed job sites for work at home positions and got one for a remote tech support company that contracts out to other companies. The team I got placed in works with customers of a large ISP/cable/phone provider. 

Now, I’ve had some of Those Calls, but none that stood out on their own enough to make a post out of. Most calls are just people changing their modems and needing to activate the new one or their internet’s out and they didn’t reset it before calling. Most calls end nicely with me being thanked and the customer being connected. 

Most calls. 

Had one guy whose modem would not connect to our system no matter what we did. I got him a tech scheduled, and in the meantime he asked what he could do. I told him as he mentioned that the modem was hot, he could unplug it and let it sit for a while and see if that made a difference. Then he hit me with this gem:

“Yeah, I’ll put in it in the fridge for a bit to cool off.”

Thankfully I managed to convince him to Not Do That.

Another call featured an older man living in an in-law house on his daughter’s property. He said their power went out but his daughter’s internet came back when the power did while his stayed out when his power was restored. Sure enough, our system didn’t see the modem, and when I asked him, his modem didn’t even have a power light on no matter where he plugged it in. Scheduled a tech, and just for kicks, asked if there was anything unusual in the area that may have caused the power to go out. 

“Oh yeah, a tornado went through my backyard yesterday.”

How do you not lead with that? Especially when you live in a tiny Northeast state that rarely gets tornadoes? 

Next day after tornado man, I had a call from a woman who just wanted to know where the store closest to her was so she could swap out her rented modem for another, thinking it was bad. I told her and when she mentioned she didn’t think it would be open, I told her the hours. 

“Oh, no, I just meant that a tornado went down that street yesterday.”

Same state, different town. What are the odds. 

Tonight, though, tonight is the cherry on top. I am on shift as I type this. I am still redder than a tomato.

I don’t have an official script, just guidelines, and I gave myself a little script just for convenience’s sake. I answer every call as “Thank you for calling [ISP]. My name is [x], and who do I have the pleasure of speaking with tonight?”

Now I work nights, 6PM to Midnight, and my customers are all an hour ahead of me. Because of this, my shift is not very busy and I have loads of time between calls. I end up doing lots of other things from homework to playing on my Switch. Whenever a call comes in, I just shove everything aside and go into that script. 

Somehow, I fucked up. Somehow, my words got twisted as I set aside my Switch and pulled my keyboard toward me. Somehow, the word “speaking” did not come out of my mouth. 

I said “who do I have the pleasure of sleeping with-oF SPEAKING WITH tonight?!”

I. Was. Mortified. I was tensing up like I was turning stone. I was so ready for this woman to rip me a new one. But no. She didn’t seem to notice what just happened and explained her problem to me. Simple reset call, she was connected in minutes, but the entire time I was dying inside. Absolutely dying.

Get me to sales!,"First time posting, several years in call center work. Stupid little call but it made me laugh so I had to share! 

For context, I work in the sales department for an internet and cable provider. People call me looking for prices on internet and cable, but every few calls I’ll get an existing customer on the line because they don’t want to wait on hold and call sales to get to a person (which is fine, I’m happy to help). 

In addition, it may be important to note that although we have local offices, they are closed due to the pandemic, so anything you need must be handled over the phone, although I occasionally do have people who are not happy with this and want to talk to someone local 

A customer called in and his account popped up on my computer screen, so I knew he was an existing customer

Me - Me

CX - customer 

Here is how our exchange went: 

Me: “hello thank you for calling X cable company, how can I help you?”

CX: “I need sales”

Me: “I’m in sales, what can I do for you?”

CX: “no I need someone local”

Me: “we don’t have anyone local you can talk to due the pandemic, but I’m sure I can answer any questions you have.”

CX: “no, I need something local for my Buick, I need sales for my local Buick here in Columbus.”

Me: “Buick... like the car Buick?”

CX: “Yes I need my the sales department for my local Buick dealership, can you get them on the line?”

Me: “Sir, we are a cable company” 

CX: “I know! I just miss the good old days where you’d call an operator, and they’d get you to whoever you need... Figured I’d just call you and have you do it instead, Just get me to Buick please!”

 He was nice enough so I ended up googling the phone number and transferring him, but it still gave me a good laugh!",25,0,0
"""Ah, you said the word. Good night""","I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

I received this call back on Sunday. Before transferring me the customer, the agent who received the call explained me that the rental was denied because the customer prepaid with a debit card. Since the pick up location was the airport and she was local, they wouldn't release the vehicle. Solution? Cancel the reservation and issue a full refund, simple, right?

H: HenriquesDumbCousin

C: Customer

H: I was being explained by my agent that you have this reservation at the airport, but they won't release the vehicle, correct?

C: Yeah, I don't have a major credit card, we only use cash and debit...

H: I do apologize for the inconvenience, due to the circumstances I'll have to cancel the Reservation and issue a full refund.

C: But I called three times, I explained them that I was going to pay with a debit card and they told me that it was okay.

To me it's always fishy when they say that they had called in advance, especially if they mention that they called more than one time. It's like when they claim that they had already called and extended the Reservation, only to call later to extend it, why would you call again if the extension went smoothly? Then again, there are some truly bad agents who really need some coaching, so who knows? Maybe she called three times and got three bad agents? 

H: I do apologize for that, while they do accept debit cards at that location, they have some specific requirements, like being an airline passenger and have a return ticket.

C: So basically you're telling me that I'm fucked, I'm stranded and no one can help me.

H: It's unfortunate to say the last, but unless you have a major credit card, there's nothing we can do.

C: But I called three times, I'm sure you have those calls recorded, I told them specifically that I only had a debit card and they knew that I wasn't an airline passenger!

H: I agree ma'am, those agents were misinformed, sadly the only option is to cancel the Reservation and issue a full refund.

C: So I'm fucked? Is that what you're saying? You're fucked, thank you and good bye?

H: If you use that word again, I'll release the call, okay?

She kept telling me that this wasn't her fault, that she had called three times. She eventually asked if she could pick up the vehicle at a location downtown. I would have suggested this if it wasn't for the fact that...

H: You reserved a pick up truck, ma'am, you require a major credit card to rent that type of vehicle.

C: But it's not the airport, they accept debit cards in the city.

H: They do, but only for regular sized vehicles and SUVs, they won't accept your debit card for that type of vehicle.

C: If you don't want to help me, connect me with someone who can.

H: There's no one at the call center who can assist you, ma'am, otherwise I would have done it in the first place.

C: I used to work in a call center and there's always someone who can do something for me.

H: I do apologize, but there's no department that has the authority to have the vehicle released.

C: Just connect me to someone higher than you, I don't care if I have to wait 30 fucking minutes...

H: Ah, you said the word. Good night!

I hate delusional customers who think that I have a magical button that will resolve all their problems. Is it unfortunate that her rental is denied? Yeah, but the fact that she refuses to take no for an answer is baffling to me. Do they think I enjoy being yelled at? Being told that I'm useless because I can't help them? Of course not, if there was a way to fix situations like this, I would have done it in the first place.",592,0,0

Why do people thing it's okay to be so damn creepy?!,"I work in a call center for a military-affiliated credit union. I've had this job for five or six weeks now. I'm only trained to do basic shit. I'm essentially the gateway to other departments. I do enjoy the job for the most part. My coworkers are chill, and my direct supervisor is amazing. Most of the ops officers are amazing. I get some really sweet, fun members. 

This is not about one of them. 

We were getting fucked yesterday. At one point, we had 42 people in the queue with an average 10 minute wait time. Yes, it could be worse, I'm aware, but it was not fun. Social security, military, civil service, and vet benefits pay out today. The day before and of are always shitty. 

I'm plowing through calls as fast as I can, and I get this member who's sending money to someone else's internal account. OTP him, boom, whatever. 

M: My stupid ass

CF: Creepy fuck

Me: Thank you for calling [credit union]. My name is Vogeltje. May I have your first and last name please?

(CF is a screen pop, all I need is his first and last name.)

I go through OTP bs with him to authenticate him for the transaction. Here's where the fun starts. He starts talking, making it pretty clear that he's essentially his wife's sugar daddy. He started talking about politics, saying how he's colorblind and has an Asian wife. He's more than willing to talk about gender and racial equality **if** it'll make the violence stop, etc, etc, making it sound like it's conditional. I'm just trying to get this over with.

M: How much did you want to transfer today?

CF: [amount] I like to make sure my wife can pay her balance. She takes care of me, I keep her bills paid. I wish it was always this frisky.

CF: Yep. Hey, where are you from? Your accent sounds cool. 

(I'm American, born and raised in the US, but due to legit brain damage, I have an accent that sounds generically European. I have a bullshit story I tell members.)

M: Oh. I was born and raised in the US. I grew up around a lot of immigrants and expats though. Childhood neuroplasticity is black magic, y'know? My brain sucked it up like a sponge.

CF: Oh, yeah. That's absolutely true. That's really cool. 

M, awkwardly trying to move things along: Oh, thank you. Yeah, it's definitely an interesting story. 

CF: If I met you in person, I'd be in trouble.

"Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes: A Saga","I work as a technical support/escalated call handler for an insurance call center. I work the late night shift. Most of my calls are helping reps navigate the ins and outs of various insurance contracts. One of my many duties of this job is understanding underwriting criteria and explaining it to others. An additional duty is to keep the company compliant with state and federal regulations. As a result, I don't always deliver good news to my callers. This call was no exception.

Cast of Characters: Me, Rep, Screaming Lady (SL)

As this is long, there's a TL; DR at the end. 

Me: Technical Support, this is mentalgopher. How may I help you?

Rep: Hey, mentalgopher, do you have an auto policy coming through for SL?

Me: It's trying to. What's going on, Rep?

Rep: SL wants to escalate. Her policy cancelled due to underwriting reasons last week and she wants to have it reinstated. She said she didn't get any notice.

(Contextual Note 1: If your insurance company is going to cancel your policy due to underwriting, they are legally required to give you what your state deems sufficient notice before the cancellation occurs. We can email the notice to you if we have your consent, but we're also legally obligated to mail it to you via USPS. This is done so you can cure the issue or obtain new insurance. If your reason for us cancelling your policy is not curable, we will not reinstate your policy with remarkably few exceptions. Some cancel reasons are serious enough where you cannot reinstate or write a new policy with us.)

Me: And she's only just calling us now...?

Rep: Yeah.... She requested a supervisor because I told her she would have to talk about this with underwriting to get this reinstated, and they're closed.

Me (reviewing notes and the cancel notice): She can talk to underwriting until the cows come home, but the notes and notice are clear about this not being something we can reinstate *or* rewrite.

Rep: I didn't see any notes on here.

(Contextual Note 2: This was the rep's second day on the phones, so I cut her slack. There were notes. *Lots of them*, all of which were **juicy**. She was a frequent flier on our line for escalations. I had even documented an escalation from her three months ago when her policy was about two months old. At that time, the only remarkable thing about her was that she had six escalations prior to mine. Now there were about quadruple that number. But the cherry on top was the *reason* for her policy cancellation: She called in a claim, stopped filing the claim midway through intake, called customer service to cut her deductible to a quarter of what it was, then filed the claim again with a later date of loss. On top of that, her kid was operating the vehicle at the time. Claims found out that she had lied on the phone to the agent about this kid driving vehicles and living in the household. I can only tell her the reason for the cancel; I cannot go into the additional details, though I am able to see them.)

Me: Not only do the notes make it clear, but so does the notice we mailed her five weeks ago regarding this issue. I have no problem saying no to her on this, either. Send her on through.

(Transfer comes through moments later.)

Me: Hi, my name is mentalgopher. Am I speaking with SL?

SL: ARE YOU A SUPERVISOR?!?!?!

Me: I am. I understand you're requesting to have your policy reinstated because you feel you didn't receive sufficient notice?

SL: CAN YOU DO IT OR NOT? IF YOU CAN'T, GET ME THROUGH TO SOMEONE WHO CAN!!!!

Me: I want to review a few things with you before we go over this. Please verify your email address and mailing address for me.

(SL bellows her email address and mailing address into the phone.)

Me: Thank you for verifying. We sent out two emails to the email provided on XX/XX and XX/XY dates. A certified letter that went over the cancellation reason was sent out on XX/XX, as well. The notice we provided for this cancellation was more than sufficient per your state's regulations. We will not be reinstating your policy at this time. No one at this company will be reinstating this policy. 

SL: WHY THE F\*\*\* NOT, YOU STUPID C\*\*T?!?!?! 

Me: Per your policy contract, we can cancel you at any time if it's determined that you knowingly misrepresented a material fact or circumstance in connection with the presentation of a claim. That same part of your contract also mentions that we can cancel you at any time if it's determined that you knowingly misrepresented a material fact or circumstance at the time of applying for or obtaining a renewal for this policy. Directing obscenities at me will not change what appears in your contract or reinstate your policy, so please refrain from using them on this call.

SL: YOU AREN'T HELPING ME, THOUGH, YOU B\*\*\*H! I CAN SAY ANYTHING I WANT TO YOU! YOU'RE GOING TO GET ME FIRED FROM MY JOB BECAUSE NOW I DON'T HAVE A F\*\*\*ING POLICY! I DELIVER THE NEWSPAPERS WITH THAT CAR, SO I'LL TELL THEM HOW HORRIBLE YOU ARE!

Me: I'll take this time to ask you again to abstain from using profanity on this recorded call. I will also just verify with you that you're stating on a recorded line that this vehicle is being used for newspaper delivery, but you had it insured on a personal auto policy?

SL: ISN'T THAT WHAT I JUST SAID, YOU STUPID C\*\*T-FACED W\*\*\*E?!?!

Me: Based on what you've just admitted on a recorded line to me, even if your cancellation had been for something other than misrepresentation on an application ***and*** in presenting a claim, your policy was still unacceptable due to the nature of your business use. Normally, I'd refer you to the commercial auto department, but the cancellation due to misrepresentation means we will not write you a new policy in any department. 

SL: WELL, WHAT USE ARE YOU, YA STUPID F\*\*\*FACE?! YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A WHOLE FAMILY HOMELESS!!!!! DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD, YOU HORRIBLE COW?!?!?!

Me: There are other insurance companies, ma'am. There's also your state's insurance pool in the event that at least two insurers in (state redacted) decline to offer you a policy. You should explore those options. Anything else I can go over with you this evening?

SL: NO, YOU F\*\*\*ING USELESS HEIFER! -Click-

TL; DR: Caller is upset that we cancelled her policy for lying to us about two separate yet vital things. She wanted me to reinstate it, swore at me the whole time while I kept telling her no.

"""Oh you'll replace my appliance for me? Cool, give me a bunch of free stuff with it.""","I had a call a few days ago where the customer had an appliance that was malfunctioning, and I already knew It was going to be rough because after I said my greeting I couldn't get a word in for a good little while, and he was saying that he wanted it to be replaced with a different appliance entirely.

I finally got to speak, got his information, and walked through some TSing. 

Afterwards I let him know that the appliance will need to be replaced, but I can only send the same model. He agreed, and I got him set up for a replacement.

I let him know that the replacement doesn't come with accessories so he'd need to keep any that he has. (These are optional items that you could purchase for the appliance, but they are not necessary for the appliance to work)

Well, he let me know that he wanted these THREE specific accessories included with his replacement, (one of which he didn't purchase in the first place, he just wanted us to send it to him for free) AND a coupon for some free stuff.

I sent him the coupon, but let him know that I can't include the accessories but he wasn't having it, he wanted to stay on the line while I asked for permission. 

I finally let him know that I would need to put in a request with our parts department so they could look into sending them to him, and that he would receive a follow-up email but I can't guarantee anything.

The 'incident',"I don't think that I've ever contributed this here, but this was the event that made me decide that I needed to pursue a different career. I loved my job...until this started.

I can't provide too many details for confidentiality reasons, but I'll do my best to get the point across. TL; DR at the end

There was a major campaign offering customers substantial money back in the form of gift cards. Advertised everywhere. Usually there was communication to us when these events happened, but in this case we received about the same information as the customers did.

The calls started about a week after the campaign started. Customers calling to say they didn't get their gift card when their item arrived. With the first few calls, we made an educated guess that it would be recieved later (which ended up being correct) and followed up with head office for more info. Radio silence.

We had a visit from someone from head office 2 weeks later. When they came to our department, they noticed how many supervisor calls were happening. We explained the situation and they were able to get us a bit more info, 4- 6 weeks for the gift cards to arrive. Perfect, we had a time-frame.

4 weeks hit, we asked for patience.
5 weeks hit, patience started wearing thin.
6 weeks hit, the calls ramped up. All hands on deck, 10 - 11 hour shifts, all OT approved. We were 6 supervisors for 100 agents, when we arrived, we had a lineup 8- 9 agents each waiting for us to take escalations. Most calls ended in being threatened with lawyers. It became par for the course. After hours, we drank. A lot.

Still radio silence from head office. So I contacted the person who had gotten us the information on the time-frame. Was there ANY reason they could give us that they hadn't arrived yet? Yes. It wasn't any purchase. It was a purchase that contained specific features. Not everyone was entitled. Cue more drinking.

12 weeks after it started, we got a list of eligible orders. Only about 20% of the people who were expecting gift cards were actually getting them. We had caps on what we were able to offer in terms of compensation, and it didn't touch even the lowest gift card amount. We were now in constant contact with legal, head office, every one. We begged, please, send a communication, this can't continue. Agents were calling in sick - mental health days after getting yelled at all day, and I didn't blame them. Even the most stoic supervisor was starting to crack around the edges and become heated on calls, this thing had eroded our professionalism.

I sent a report to head office with all of the accounts who had contacted us about the issue. It was substantial. Ended up getting approval for a tiger team of outbound agents to call customers back and offer them more compensation than we were usually permitted.

13 years later, this is still the most stressful thing that I have ever experienced professionally.

TL;DR $$ was promised with conditions that most customers didn't meet. 15 weeks, 10000 escalations.",342,0,0

Is asking for free stuff and money normal?,"I started working in a call center back in january. Quickly rised and I'm now in escalations. One thing I've noticed (working for a subcontractor that offers call center services to a large company in the US, myself working in central america and in a completely different culture):

Is asking for money and for free stuff common?
In my experience 9 out of 10 calls people request stuff to be discounted, to be shipped free, to be given away and ""compensation"" to be offered for any offense. 

Is this normal in US culture or is it that I'm facing strange individuals? Funny thing is that my company is one of those really cheapo ones where all the products and services need to be as cheap as possible to be able to offer competitive prices, so while we do have compensation options its always a small percentage or something below the $25 dollar mark.

So, is that common practice?

I have never understood this,"Obligatory mobile warning.

I have made my peace with entitled people.  I understand they exist, and most of their entitlement comes from decades of engrained superiority that customer service instills in them with an unhealthy amount of ignorance.  But one thing I will never understand is why people who are hard of hearing try to act like they understand what the other person on the end is saying.  If you don't understand what we are saying, why waste your time having a completely different conversation than the one I'm trying to lead?  Afraid that we'll laugh at you for not understanding us?

Honey, for one thing, we are not allowed to laugh or have real emotions on calls.  Never have been, never will be.  And for two, if you are worried about feeling embarrassed for asking we repeat ourselves, we deal with far more humiliating displays than that on the regular.  Compared to a grown adult throwing a nuclear, toddler-like temper tantrum over a mistake they made and blaming us for it, asking we repeat ourselves because you didn't understand us would go unnoticed at best or bring a quiet chuckle out of us at worst.  So please, stop wasting your time and ours by pretending you knew what we say when you didn't.  And if the call is impossible to understand, hang up and try again when you have better reception, don't just sit on the line complaining about the call quality.  There ain't jack we can do about it.

Sincerely,
A very confused and aggravated rep",23,0,0
2nd Shift,For the ones who work second shift what's your take on the call flow? I have been working 9am to 5pm since I've start taking calls about 5 weeks ago. I normally prefer working morning but I feel that the customer's will be a little more tolerable... My new shift is now 11:15am to 10pm,5,0,0
I love writing professionally cheeky comments on customers accounts.,"This happened today. 

I work for a government agency that has become rather popular in recent days. We had a new program released where people can get additional funds for a 6 week time period. Everyone and their mother has been calling in about not getting these payments, so it’s important we write in our comments whether or not the person has received the funds or not if that’s why they call in. 

This guy was so fun to talk to. We had a great rapport, he was laughing. He asked me if he has received his funds yet, and I fully expect them not to be there, but it turns out he received the funds exactly as the program states he should have (shocking, I know). So I tell him that I’m happy he filled out the notice he received (stupid computer systems) and that all his funds have been deposited. He was pleasantly surprised, which I found amusing. We end the call, and I dispo it. I start to type my general comment, but at the end, I get cheeky with it because all this guy would’ve had to do is check his bank account and 1 news source to get his answer:

“X calling in to double check if he received his (new fed program) benefits. He did.”

That comment is professional enough, and brings me eternal joy. I hope some of you can understand  :)",90,0,0
"The time I got the mountain rescue team scrambled, along with the air ambulance...","Hello all you glorious redditors here, I did post here a few years ago, but long since deleted my account and the tales with it - but alas I thought I would start posting stories of times gone by - now on to the story time!

**Background:**

At the age of 36 I live in my home town in Scotland where I was born and grew up, went to school and have my current job in retail for nearly four years now. This tale, amongst others that follow in this subreddit are from my job before this, where I worked in a callcentre for a national broadband, phone &amp; tv provider. I was in the business faults for broadband/phone line dealing with customers which I dealt with either on the phone or live chat over the 10 and a half years I was there before I was let go (that is a story for another time) - this story is from at some point whilst working there. It's worth keeping in mind that any names of customers, me and the company I did work for have been changed obviously to protect identities.

I did post previously, under the story:

[A decade worth of e-mails all gone, by the simple non clicking of a box. Life is fun, innit?](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/io57yo/a_decade_worth_of_emails_all_gone_by_the_the/)

**Cast for this story:**

**Scotch:** Take a wild guess, hot stuff ;)

**HP:** Helicopter Pilot

**CM:** Cool Manager (went through a couple whilst there, but at this point in time, CM was awesome)

**CW:** Co-Worker

**The Story:**

For this story I was on the front line desk for *\*shitty ISP\** after being on their second line desk for a bit and them wanting me to go back to help share my knowledge with the front line team. enjoy. This call happened on a Monday.

*\*beep\**

**Scotch:** Welcome to &lt;telco's business support line&gt; my name is Scotch, who am I speaking to today and how can I help?

**HP:** Hi, my name is HP our broadband service is down, so can't provide the essential services we need to the local community - can you help us get our services back online?

**Scotch:** Sure, let me get some account details from you and lets see if we can get the problem fixed for you today EC.

*\*does account verification\**

I can see from their account they provide emergency services for the highlands - search and rescue style thing for those lost hiking on the mountains.

**Scotch:** Ok HP, I have done all the checks that need to and can see the account is all as it should. I have checked our outages system with nothing showing down in your area code.

*For those who are reading this outside the UK, a typical broadband phone number via copper phone line is 01234 567898 style, as is any standard phone line number, our notice board had nothing for the customer's 01234 code, so in that instance, normal process was to go through basic checks and see if what was happening.*

**Scotch:** What I can do with yourself is go through some checks too see if we can get this back online, before we do I just need to ask, do you or the owner/caretaker of the building not provide you with a secondary line for Broadband/Phone services in case of this scenario?

**HP:** We don't have a backup line I am afraid, to be honest we never really thought of it - as we never thought this type of thing would happen! *\*I died a little inside when I heard that statement - as I had heard it far too often, people not having backup\** But I will mention that to my boss next time we speak! Though I must warn you, I am just the pilot who fly's the helicopter's for the search and rescue and don't know much about this IT &amp; computer stuff but will do my best.

**Scotch:** Not a problem, can I just confirm the number that you are calling from, incase we get disconnected from?

**HP:** Yes, it's &lt;not number connected to account&gt; - but only use this for today and this call, as broadband telephone number oddly still works for incoming calls *(this will be classed as* ***line 1*** *later)*, the other number *(this will be classed as* ***line 2*** *later)* we have on site is our emergency number, which you don't want to call. (Important for later)

**Scotch:** Sure, no worries. Whilst we have been speaking I ran a few checks on the line using our diagnostics systems and can see that apart from some upstream noise on the line which could potentially indicate something on site causing the issue, all appears to be fine. I can see the total downtime of the connection has been for 5 hours. In basic terms, we need to rule out anything your end to get you back online ok? I will keep it simple as possible.

**Scotch:** Do you know what modem/router you have to connect with? It's a typically a silver box with black sides and 4 lights on it? *(This was the typical ISP one we provided at shitty ISP for customers, only difference was it allowed the use of statics compared to the consumer model)* 

**HP:** We have loads of box's here at the command unit with blinking lights on them, so it's going to be a hard one to figure out chief!

**Scotch:** Ok, sure thing - I get that! If you check for me you said the phone line has a phone in it which still has calls on it? Is there a wire coming out from there somewhere that goes to a wall socket of some kind for you to make calls? Your modem maybe connected to that?

**HP:** Sure, give me a moment to check...

*After a few moments of some huffs and grunts and some noise coming from his end, he comes back to me to update on progress. By this point around 15 minutes had went into the call as it took him a bit to verify account.*

**HP:** Ok, I had a look and was able to see that the cable goes from the phone to the wall socket, but that's it - I don't see any box's or blinking lights tied to it.

**Scotch:** Ok, it sounds like an extension socket, not the main master socket where the modem maybe connected, are you able to check to see if you have any other phone sockets?

**HP:** Sorry to be a pain here, but I have an &lt;important meeting to deal with in regards to our company setup here&gt;, but I am glad to know that's not a major issue on the line or to do with your network. Look can you get one of your colleagues to call back on **line 1** (aka - their BB line that received incoming calls, which he advised was NOT the emergency line)  for Thursday? 

**Scotch:** Sure, with this being Monday, we will have slots for them, do you have a preferred time? Also with your IT guy be there or someone who know's your setup there? Also just to confirm **Line 1** is xxxxx xxxxxx and that's the number for the call back? Not **Line 2** on yyyyy yyyyyy?

**HP:** Yeah, the IT guy will be in then, hence asking for Thursday - as I am on holiday as of tomorrow. His name is &lt;random name&gt;, if you call around 11:00 am he should be there and yes, that is the correct number!

**Scotch:** OK, that's it done and thanks for your help today!

*\*click - call ends and I update notes, put it in the queue for callback Thursday\**

Cue Friday when I roll in and manager and one of the callback agents was by my desk waiting on me coming in, asking me to come into meeting room.

**CM:** Ok Scotch, the reason me and **CW** are here are to discuss a call you had on Monday, the company name was XYZ and you spoke to **HP** regarding his fault for the broadband fault, booking a callback for Thursday, is this correct?

*\*after around thirty seconds or so I start to remember it\**

**Scotch:** Yes, I do remember it - why are we here? Do I need the union here for representation? Am I being investigated for something?

**CW:** Don't worry Scotch, it's nothing like that, I called them back as per instructions in the case notes on **line 1** as you stated in the notes, when I called them I heard the guy on the end of the phone saying to me (paraphrasing):

\--------

**Guy End On Phone:** This is the mountain rescue team here, that's the helicopter now being dispatched, can you reconfirm the the GPS co-ords again of the person needing rescued?

**CW:** Hi this is **CW** calling regarding your broadband issue that you reported on Monday?

**Guy End On Phone:** Eh, what? What broadband issue? Who are you? Why are you calling us about broadband? This is an emergency service and emergency line, doing prank calls on this number is wrong!!!! Why are you calling us?

**CW:** I can assure you sir, this is not a prank call? I am calling regarding a broadband fault that **HP** called about on Monday to us asking us to call you back on **Line 1** to talk to &lt;IT Guy's name&gt; regarding the fault?

**Guy On End Of Phone:** Our broadband is working, why are you even calling us? GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOW!!!!

\--------

**CM:** The manager that took that call was me, after speaking to him and a few threats, I listened to your call, to hear your side of it. Everything you did was correct, you followed the process and done things right, even confirmed the contact number from the customer. It actually transpires that broadband was actually on **Line 2** and not the first one, the customer was actually looking at the wrong phone and socket and had got the two numbers mixed up. 

**Scotch:** Ahh, so I done nothing wrong?

**CM:** No, you did not, after him calming down, he asked me to call him back in 10 minutes, which I agreed to. After phoning him back, he spoke to the IT guy who said that he had taken the broadband down for 6 hours to re-do some of their IT setup, change some components around and install some new equipment. which he had communicated out, but **HP** did not know that. He had came in wanting to use the broadband for some stuff, noticed it was down and then called you, whilst the IT guy was taking a break and did not see him. As he left the IT guy came back and finished off the job.

**Scotch:** So, what was the outcome then? Why have I been brought here into a meeting without union? *(When ever I go into any meeting I ALWAY""S request union to keep the meeting correct)* 

**CM:** As for **HP** \- the manager I spoke to on site, after I explained to him that after listening to the call he gave **line 1** and not **line 2** as the right number has been trained on what is right and also to speak to IT first as the initial callback to the wrong number could have cost us *\*shitty ISP\** around £20,000 for the misuse of their service and other costs.  No further action required, from our end - this meeting was just to let you know what happened on the callback just incase it came back, ok?

**CW:** Yeah, everything that could have been covered was - so you have nothing to worry about, the HP guy was just a bit out of the loop!

After exchanging a few pleasantry's we then went back to our desks and continued on with our days, I still remember to it this day.

**TLDR:** **As I sit there, at my desk with my flask of whisky and eating my haggis, I wonder what my next call would be? But then my moose beckons me out the window, indicating another rescue for us to attend! I just hope that it's not a false alarm as we both have been waiting for an easy night, after hunting and managing the lands! If only there was away for people to communicate more effectively...**",30,0,0
Working from home,"I am currently working remotely from home, due to the pandemic, which I love and completely appreciate. The only thing that’s driving me crazy is that I keep losing connection. So my computer will randomly drop my calls, not load websites, not load my email which I need for the majority of my calls, etc.  we have people that check this and work on it. They keep blaming my Internet, I am paying for the highest speed which is over $100 a month, and I keep having my Internet company come out here and say my Internet is fine. I keep telling our technicians that my Internet speed is amazing until I connect to their VPN. Then then speed goes down to almost nothing.  And then the technician will change his statement and see it’s because so many people are working at home on the server. In the cycle happens over and over and over again.

I’m just curious about how many people are working from home and if so what are the technical problems are you having?

The day I almost got a close friend fired,"So, I worked in a call centre for just shy of 6 months, during my time there, unbeknownst to me, a friend who I've known for years has applied to this same centre and got a job.

We're always chatting and annoying each other when time allows.

One day, he decided he wanted to throw paper at me, and over a colleague, which isn't exactly out of the ordinary, but fine.

The moment I'm off my call, and writing in the account, I retaliate and hit him in the face.

My buddy's a big and kind hearted soul.

Would legitimately not hurt a fly and give you the shirt off his back.

The moment I hear the sweet sweet sound of paper on face, I hear one of the most dreaded words he could've uttered while on a call ""Fuck""

Me, feeling absolutely horrible that the nicest guy I ever met, just said what he did on a call, I put myself into after call, go to the supervisor desk, tell them what happened, taking 100% responsibility because it's my fault.

Obviously my supervisor is super annoyed at me being a dipshit but sends me back to my station, but I bypass my area and relay what happened to my friend, because he could see what I did.

I apologized profusely and told him not to worry about anything, that I'll take any and all disciplinary action that goes his way.

He then breaks out into a smile and points to his phone, and a certain button. The mute button.

He was apparently watching my moves and muted himself before swearing, so there was absolutely no way the customer would've heard him.

Buddy was extremely grateful about my honesty and laughed it off with me in the end.

Don't Show Up at My House!,"If you receive a call about us coming to provide services for your home when you are not a customer, I need at least a name and phone number for management to call you back and figure it out.  Plus a house address. No, I don't want to sell you services, I just want to help solve the misunderstanding. 
 If we show up because there is no way for us to know who you are and if you were the person to have a problem, you can't tell us we are trespassing and call the police. It is YOUR fault for yelling at me (a sales rep btw) and then hanging up when I try to explain I want to get a phone number and name for us to figure this out, as I do not get caller numbers on my dialer.

All you need to do is send in a request,"Me: Thank you for calling Company, my name is ___. Who am I speaking with?

Wife: Hi, my name is Wife. I was speaking with a rep earlier and they said they couldn’t take a driver of my policy?

M: Okay, I’ll take a look here in a sec. Could you please verify this info?

*verifies*

M: So were you looking to take off Driver or Husband off the policy.

W: Driver.

M: All right. Driver is listed on this policy as secondary named insured. So in order to take him off of this policy we would need a request to remove him to be sent in along with your signatures. I would be more than happy to forward you our contact info so we can process this asap.

W: I don’t understand, why do I need to send in a request? Driver no longer drives our vehicle and I don’t have his contact information. Just remove him from the policy.

M: A request needs to be sent in because he was listed as the secondary name insured. This makes him the second account owner and gives him the same power as you, the named insured, has on the policy. Hence, I cannot remove him via verbal request as it violates our guidelines.

Husband, in the background: I pay for this policy! I don’t remember asking him to be listed as secondary named insured! Just take him off the policy!!

M: I’m sorry, but at some point the named insured okayed listing Driver as secondary named insured.

H: So you can’t just remove him?

M: We can. However, we require a request with signatures to be sent in first for processing.

H: If you can’t take Driver off the policy just cancel it and I’ll find insurance elsewhere!

M: Wife, you are the named insured. You have the authority to cancel this policy and not Husband.

*Husband keeps ranting and raving in the background to cancel cancel cancel the policy and how this is unfair and ridiculous*

W: …I guess I’ll just cancel the policy since he’s so upset… ***CLICK***

Because she hung up before I could go through the cancellation scripting, I could not cancel the policy. All I could do at this point was leave a note and hope the poor rep who got them next time whenever they decided to call back (probably in regards to a billing invoice or cancellation due to nonpayment notice) could tolerate them better than I could.

TL;DR: could not remove secondary named insured without a request and signatures. Named insured (wife) did not understand nor did her husband (just a driver). Husband yelled at wife to cancel. She hung up before I could go through the proper process so they’re still going to get a billing invoice and/or a cancellation notice for nonpayment.",37,0,0
Finally cracked on a caller.,"I was barely awake enough to speak to humans but I had to start my shift and hit the dreaded green button that gives the go ahead to get calls. *ding* and gave my greeting which asks how I could help. The woman immediately began yelling at me her issues and complaining and asked for a supervisor right away and that she will not speak to me. I remained calm and explained to her I would still have to verify all of her information and attempt to assist her before a supervisor will even take a call. She yelled some more about how I was not helping yada yada. I explained again that I would be glad to assist her (that's a lie) and let's get through the verification. Yell, yell, yell.

I get yelled at a lot despite being calm, polite and professional to these assholes. I'm a very sensitive person, I can't handle getting yelled at, it's extremely mentally and emotionally hard on me. I have applied at over 100 places in the last 2 years of working here but no interviews even when I call the locations and let them know how interested I am in an interview.

Anyways... Something finally just SNAPPED and it went something like this: ""you're going to stop talking and stop yelling at me and listen to me, I'm not gonna put up with this! I get yelled at all day for not doing anything to cause the hostility and attacks on me, I get paid minimum wage and that's not enough to deal with your attitude or anyone else's attitude. I'm a person with feelings just like you! I have lots of problems right now but I wasn't gonna take it out on you and treat you badly. My cat is dying, I am having health issues but don't make enough money to see a Dr, my health insurance has a 5000 dollar deductible and no copays so I have to pay full cost, I'm stuck at this the horrible job dealing with horrible people and not for lack of trying to get another job. So here's the deal, you can either treat me better for the rest of this phone call and I can see how I can best help you or you can be put back in the queue, wait on hold however long for a rep and go through it all over again, or just let me help you and not be rude!""

She actually was silent for a few seconds, said she was sorry and that she was just very frustrated and will continue the call with me. We did the call, I had to put her on hold a few times to do research to help her. One hold I came back to tell her I'm still working on it and she gave me a sincere heart felt apology admitting her wrong, and I let her know I appreciate the apology. I did solve her problem, though.

Luckily this call wasn't heard and I still have the job. But I have to be honest, it felt amazing giving it right back to them.",1387,0,0
I was a switchboard operator at a Veteran's Administration medical center,"A very intoxicated man called one night around midnight from (757) 234-**** and told me that he needed a place to stay. I told him I didn’t have anywhere to refer him to but he was welcome to come to the ED. He started yelling at me and told me he was, “in another city.” I told him to go to an ER in whatever city he was in. He said “they” told him I would get him a bed. I asked who “they” were but he couldn’t remember who he had talked to. I told him I really didn’t have a way to get him a bed and he told me that “the president had just passed a law that said you have to take care of me.” I said I didn’t know what he was talking about and it didn’t matter because there was no one here to connect him to. He started cursing at me and told me to “get someone there.” I hung up on him.


He called back and wanted to know my name. I told him. He wanted my last name but I refused to give it to him. He started cursing and ranting at me and threatening to make me lose my job. He said that the president told him that I would get him a bed and I had to do what the president said. I told him that I doubted that he had talked to the president but even if he had there was no one here to get him a bed. He was screaming at me the entire time. I became very upset and because of this I continued to talk instead of shutting up. He said I had to get him a bed and I offered to connect him to the tele-nurse. He said okay (Not really but I’m not sure what he said since he was still screaming.) I sent him to the tele-nurse and within a minute he called back and said they told me to “hook him up” with the “homeless crisis line.” By this time I was really upset. I told him there was no homeless crisis line but there was a veteran’s crisis line and I could hook him up with that. He said, “Do it, motherfucker.”

I asked him if he had something to write with (And I was getting ready to say, “If we get disconnected” because I didn’t want him calling back.) He screamed at me, “You said you were going to hook me up. DO IT, MOTHERFUCKER!” I was shaking by that point and accidently said, “I’m not putting up with this shit” and hung up.

He called back and told me he had talked to the crisis line and they had taken a report about me. He said he was recording the call and wanted my first and last name. I refused to give him my last name and when he asked for my first name again I said that I had given it to him already. He said he wanted it again. I told him it was Bill. He then said, “You told me it was William.” I told him Bill and William was the same thing. He continued to hound and threaten me. I told him I wasn’t going to keep doing this with him. He then wanted to know, “Why you got so nasty with me when I told you to go fuck yourself.” (Really?) He also wanted to know why I was being so nasty then. I had calmed down by then and calmly asked him if “they” had gotten him a bed. He wanted to know why I wanted to know. I told him I was concerned for his welfare because it was cold and raining. He laughed and told me he was recording everything I said. I told him that was fine and wished him a good night.",55,0,0
Hello from the UK,"I literally just stumbled across this sub and I'm so happy! 

I have been working in a call centre for the past 3 years dealing with insurance. 

Not sure how I have lasted this long tbh and it's great to read your stories as sometimes it can be difficult to deal with some people mentally with this role. Thought it was just me.

I have had office roles that didn't consist of being on the phone however I do prefer this kinda job as it's very in the moment so days go a lot quicker I find, calls only last 5 mins max normally at my place however one bad call can make me want to quit. I get a fair few a week.

She's Going to the FBI,"I received this call about two weeks ago and I'm still curious how this is turning out for her. NB= Nutball caller. Me= me. 

Me: Welcome to [Bank Call Center], my name is renderingme, how may I help you today? 

NB: I just want you to know that you are the 42nd person I've talked to today and I don't think you can help me because your bank's service is terrible. 

Me: I'm sorry to hear that, what issue are you experiencing? 

(We're supposed to determine how we can help the customer before we even ask for their information and some people want to be difficult.)

NB: Well, to start with, what is your name and badge number? And spell them PHONETICALLY. 

Me: *gives out info*

NB: Where are you located? What city and state?

Me: I can only provide the state, but I am located in [State].

NB: Ok, I am going to add you to the list of 42 people I've talked to today and I'm reporting you all to the FBI. I have a long professional career and I know some people, so be prepared for the inquiry. 


At this point I literally had to stifle a laugh. I didn't even know this woman's name or what her issue is at this point but, according to her, the FBI are going to look into me mistreating her over some personal banking issue. Yeah, ok, crazy lady. 

NB: Now, this is how this is going to go. I don't think customer service can help me, so you are going to get a supervisor on the phone or corporate or whoever I need to talk to to get a check issued from my account before it closes. Get whoever I need to talk to because I know you are useless. 

Me: I'd be happy to help resolve this. My I have your card or account number?

NB: NO, YOU DON'T NEED THAT. I AM NOT TALKING TO YOU. GET ME WHOEVER I NEED TO SPEAK WITH, A SUPERVISOR OR CORPORATE OR THE PRESIDENT. I have a long career, I am very highly educated, and I know how this works. 

Me: I will get a supervisor for you but so they can assist further may I have your card or account number? I can pass that along to the supervisor so they can better assist. 

NB: NO, STOP TRYING TO GET MY INFORMATION. YOU DON'T NEED THAT. I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS. THE ONLY THING THAT SHOULD BE COMING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS ""YES, MA'AM."" I AM THE CUSTOMER. 

Me: I apologize but for the supervisor to be able to assist further, it would be easier if they had your information. May I have your name?

NB: GET ME YOUR SUPERVISOR. I TALK DIRECTLY TO THE HORSE'S MOUTH. I DON'T TALK TO PEONS. 

Me: One moment, please, I will reach out for a supervisor now. 

I got a supervisor for her and while I was finishing up my notes, I listened in to their conversation. She refused to give her name or account number to the supervisor either. The supervisor said that information is needed to be able to assist further with her account and she screamed some more and hung up. Funny thing is, if her account is closing, her branch of account is the one that is going to issue a check and the call center can't do shit, so why she was harassing the call center is anyone's guess.  Not that we can even tell what branch is hers without her information. 

I'm still waiting for the FBI inquiry.",62,0,0

Sometimes you just have to say it,"I have had 2 moments where I finally gave in and said stuff I've wanted forever to a customer.  Not fire-able territory but not quality approved.  


I do credit card escalations/sup calls for a major bank.  I am berated constantly.  One woman I was trying to explain interest to was just being horrid.  You know the story, entitled woman, cheap but trying to pass it off as moral high ground or something.  She tells me (after I explained for the 100th time I wasn't waiving the interest charge) ""it's not the interest, it's the principle!!"" Oh lord.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I had this line in reserve forever so I told her, ""Ma'am it's actually the interest ON the principle.""  Luckily she was so full of herself she assumed i was dumb and just didn't get what she meant, but I enjoyed it immensely.  And she never got that fee waived and normally I waive everything because I am tired of arguing to save money for a multi billion dollar bank. 

Another guy was being soooo condescending about this charge on his card.  It was back in the day when if a merchant was billing you repeatedly and wouldn't stop we would try and block them from charging you (called a stop pmt).  This particular charge was a Trump campaign donation.  Guys I couldn't help it.  I told this man, ""what I've done is build a wall around your account so the charges can't get in.""  It was sooo much fun.  Still not sure if he got it because he was so furious that we were ALLOWING them to bill the acct (we don't know! If we blocked it without you telling us to you would be screaming about discrimination so wtf ever. Plus you get involved with a conman what did you expect?)  I enjoyed that moment so much.

Me: Thank you for calling! My name is ____. Who am I speaking with?

Mary Sue: Hi, my name is Mary Sue. I’m calling for John Doe. I’m his gf. I need to know the minimum payment I need to make today.

M: Hmm okay. I can take a payment of $100 today to reactivate the policy with a lapse in coverage.

MS: WITH A LAPSE??? I don’t want him to have a lapse.

M: That’s okay I understand. If I could speak with John I’d be more than happy to review other options since he’s the named insured. 

MS: All right here he is.

**verifies John Doe**

M: Okay, John. We can get your policy up to current today for the amount of $250.

JD: How much? That can’t be right, my payment are $80 monthly.

M: That is correct; however, we have not received any payments since the policy was activated in June. So the $250 is to get you caught up for the months of July through September.

JD: F*cking bull. First you guys won’t cover my accident and now you’re making me pay more money while my bike is in the shop?! Mary make the payment!

At this point I can here him ranting and raving in the background.

MS: Okay I guess I’ll pay it.

M, mentally cringing: Mary I do apologize but I do have to go through a disclosure with John before I can take a payment with you.

MS: John, she has to go through a disclosure with you.

JD: OH MY F*CKING GOD!!! WHAT NOW?!

M: Sir, do I have consent to record this disclosure with you?

JD: No, why would you need to record it.

M: To reactivate policies over the phone we have to go through a verbal disclosure and electronic signature.

JD: Well I don’t want to be recorded!! I just want to make the payment!!

M: I apologize, John, but I am required to go through this disclosure first. Since you do not want to do it I cannot reactivate the policy.

JD: You know what this is f*cking bullsh*t! This is piss poor costumer service and you should be FIRED for treating me this way. I’ll go find insurance elsewhere! F*CK YOU!!! ***click***

"""I don't care if your supervisor says the same thing you just said, i want to speak to him""","I work in as a customer service representative for an international online travel agency, as you can expect I deal with alot of issues pertaining to covid19 so at this point I get yelled at on a daily basis for things I can't do because I don't have the authority to approve ALOT of things contrary to popular belief, and people can't seem to understand that at all. We have very strict procedures and everything is closely monitored, so I'm VERY aware of the limits I have. But Somehow whenever people call our customer service, they think they're going to reach our CEO directly  ?? 


I would like to think I am immune to it at this point, but often it gets too much and really aggravating really quick.


So today has been really slow, but I've been getting cases from difficult as hell customers all week, so I was expecting no less from today. And of course, ask and ye shall receive. I received a call from this Australian lady, she made a ""pay to the hotel"" reservation at some hotel in Australia for this week. In most of our forms we will need customers to key in their credit card (CC) details. Mostly it's just to avoid fraud cases and the like, because there have been alot even with CC inserted still. 


So this lady has her CC inserted to this ""pay to the hotel"" booking. One thing I should note is that for these types of reservations, we are not the ones charging them. We collect their details, yes, but in our system we have no way to charge the card directly. We see the last 4 digits of the card, but thats it. Nothing we can do aside from cancel. The hotels are the one who have the ability to perform the charges because its ""pay to the hotel."" If the hotel approves a refund for these types, the refund comes directly from the hotel's account, not us. And the hotel will charge at any given point for confirmation, most likely before it goes within the cancellation policy.


And so we always get confused customers when the hotel tries to charge the hotel before the check-in date because they assume its paying upon check-in rather than pay TO the hotel. I've never personally used this types of reservations, so I don't know what it looks like on customer's front end. But if we have so much of confusion for the same thing, obviously we have to do something about it &amp; I won't deny that for even one second.


So this lady had her CC stolen, and we weren't informed about it at all and had no clue up until this point. She probably didn't think it was our problem because she assumed her reservation can be paid AT the hotel. So she called in asking why her booking was cancelled, I found out that our supplier cancelled it yesterday because her CC was declined when the hotel tried to charge her before check-in and she didn't respond to our emails from 2 days ago asking her to provide a new one within a day or so, to avoid her reservation from being cancelled. So it was cancelled automatically because we sent her a notice &amp; she didn't respond at all.

Customer: why did you guys cancel without my permission?

Me: We have actually sent an email 2 days ago informing you that your card has been declined and it will be cancelled if we didn't receive your new details.

Customer: Yes I saw that email, but I didn't have reception so I wasn't able to open or reply to it until yesterday when I had actually received it.

Me: i'm sorry ma'am since this reservation has been cancelled and no payment has been collected, we can't uncancel this booking or search for an alternative accommodation for you as you have not been charged for this.

Customer: I don't care, that is not my problem. I didn't have reception, how was I able to access it?

Me: I understand, but your reservation has been cancelled and we can't assist you since there is no charge to this reservation.

Customer: No you don't understand. I want to talk to your supervisor

Me: Unfortunately I can't do that as we're not allowed to transfer our calls to our supervisors. Even if I did, they would advise you the exact same thing I just said.

Customer: i don't care, I don't want to speak to you anymore.

So I consulted with one of my supervisors. Guess what? He said exactly the same thing I did. I told him that I've already pushed her request back multiple times (Idk why we're not allowed to transfer to our supervisors, but I assume its to avoid frequent requests like that?) He agreed that he would take over the case if she kept insisting. He told me to mention the whole ""we sent an email, no response from u, it was cancelled, no payment was received, we can't do anything about it now"" I tried:

Customer: I don't care what you have to say. Transfer me to your supervisor even if he says the same thing as you just did. I want to speak to a supervisor

So I transferred, checked back on the case 2 hours later. Lo and behold my supervisor also couldn't offer any solutions to her since no payment was received. It would have been different if she was actually charged or if she was really not notified at all, we would have offered relocation or some type of compensation for her. We aren't heartless. He even mentions in his notes that he said the same thing I did, and suddenly shes ok with it ???? I don't get that. You couldn't accept our procedure when it came from a normal agent, but the moment you spoke to the supervisor, you're all for it...? You just wasted everyones time.

I understand that if she genuinely had no reception and suddenly found out her booking was cancelled, I would probably be pissed too. But I'd be way more pissed if it got cancelled and I was still charged, which didn't happen here. I'm just annoyed she HAD to speak to a supervisor to get off our backs. What's the point

TL;DR: Customer wanted to speak to my supervisor about our final outcome for her issue, she spoke directly to him and he parroted the exact same thing and she let it go.",41,0,0

Patient tells me I’m violating HIPAA,"So this happened yesterday. Obligatory I’m on mobile. 

I’ve been at the call center handling billing questions and collections for two years now. It’s pretty laid back and great atmosphere usually. Well a few months ago they took a couple of reps off the inbound/outbound queue and put us on this special project. I was one of them. Basically my job mostly consists of calling patients and pre-registering them for upcoming hospital tests,scans,etc. I call this patient and go through my usual greeting “hey this is anywhere hospital calling to pre-register you for your upcoming appt May I speak with patient please?” Here how’s the convo goes after the greeting

P-Patient; M-Me

P: patient speaking

M: do you have a moment to pre-register for your appt? 

P: yes

M: okay I do have to let you know that the call maybe monitored and/or record for quality assurance

P: wait stop, you know that’s illegal right? You’re breaking HIPAA by recording our conversation about my care. That’s supposed to stay between me and my dr. Who has access to this call because this is illegal! 

M: patient I can assure this is not illegal as we are not discussing details of your care. We are discussing the appt for your upcoming scan. What we are discussing today is for billing purposes and appt details like when and where to arrive. Whether or not you can eat or drink anything. I have zero clue why your dr ordered the test for so it’s in no way violating HIPAA. This conversation will be no different than if you called in to discuss your hospital bill with our billing department who also records calls for QA. Our compliance team has access to all the calls made within our center to assure QA and to make sure we do not violate HIPAA at all. So yes it is perfectly legal for us to record this conversation. So with all that in mind do you wish to proceed with the call? 

P: yes but I’m still telling you it’s illegal and I’m not happy about it. 

M: okay I understand 

I’m pretty sure if it was illegal our legal team would have told us by now it’s illegal. Also phone conversations can be subpoenaed along with medical records, billing statements, etc. so yes it’s perfectly legal to record our conversation.

The woman who ruined my day,"I’m on mobile, and I rarely ever post on Reddit. 

I work for a third party company that assists with certain benefits, we do applications and can look at cases for one state in the USA. I want to explain that I like my job, most callers are fine and if they aren’t I can usually deescalate quickly. 

Today was probably the worst day I’ve ever had working for my center. I’ve been there a year, and I’ve had some bad days but today was something else. My very first caller was one of the worst callers I’ve ever had, only two other calls come to mind. She called in to check on her case because there had been a delay in benefits. She was missing paperwork and needed to submit another application, I explained this after I verified her and then she lost it. I got ranted at for 10 minutes, I just let her talk because my head hurt and I knew she wasn’t going to stop. She said she had submitted the paperwork (they always say this), and was concerned with where it was now. I kindly explained that I’m not that office so I wouldn’t be able to find that out for her, but she could call that office directly to ask. She then said I was being combative because I told her I’m with a third party company, she then decided I was going to help her reapply. That meant I was going to have her with me at least another 20 minutes. Every question she wanted to lecture me about how to do my job and how horrible I am at it, she kept telling me not to take it personally but she was attacking me personally. The kicker was the race question, I am required to ask it. I hate that question, and I think it’s pointless. But I will fail my calls if I don’t ask it. I asked her primary race and she gave it to me, but then asked if she had to provide it. I let her know I didn’t have to select one and I could just use a default. She then went completely off on me because I didn’t give her that option before, I explained to her that I’m not allowed to do that because I have to ask them a certain way. She then said I didn’t offer her the default because I was racist, I offered the default 4 times while she was ranting at me. She said she could tell by my voice that I was white and that I was a racist because I couldn’t find her paperwork and I asked her race. We continued but she kept going back to that telling me I was racist and she could tell I hated my job because of the way I treated her. (I want to add that my customer service remained exceptional, my tone never wavered. I am very well respected at my job for my professionalism) I was upset at this point, she honestly hurt my feelings with all of the personal insults. After we finally got through it she asked me additional questions that I did not have the answer to because we are third party. I got another lecture about how I was being lazy and purposely not answering her. I got off this call and I sobbed, and I remained upset for hours. She made me feel incredibly small and worthless, it wasn’t being called a racist that bothered me because I know I’m not. It was the digs at how awful I was at everything. She honestly seemed to enjoy berating me, and I think she did want to take her issues out on someone.

This woman calls in because her Lyft is late. Lyft is one of our vendors. 

So, I pull up her account after verifying the HIPPA tokens and ask what was the appt time. She says 1045. However, that's not what my screen says. It says 1100. (We go by military time, by the way.) 

Then that's when the gates of Hades is unlocked. She  begins to tell me how she specifically told the previous agent her appointment was at 1045. 

She then goes into how since we're working from home we're some lazy b**hes and we can't do s**t right. Just a lot of swear words.

Then she hits me with the famous, ""I know it's not your fault,"" line and then proceeds to verbally thrash me some more. 

I even called her doctor's office, and got the voicemail. I explained the whole situation just to come back on the line to get thrash some more. 

So, she begins to talk to her sister and swear at me and the company again and says how ridiculous this is. 

I try to explain I'm rushing this as fast as I possible can but there's only so much I can do.

The sister is in the background rescheduling their appointments, meanwhile she's telling me all of their alignments and whatnot. I'm sitting here thinking like, ma'am I understand I fractured my hip in the military when I was 19 and will suffer with the pain for the rest of my life....also add carpal tunnel to the list....all at 23.

I can’t take it anymore and I feel like I’m admitting failure for leaving.,"I’m on mobile I’m sorry for anything that I may mistype lolol

I started working at a call center for an extremely large bank in the US in February, two weeks before March. So close to the pandemic starting that I didn’t even finish training before they sent everyone home. It has such amazing pay and it’s full time unlike any other job in my area, it even has benefits down to pet insurance. At first it was fine when we were primary needs only mode. But now we’re going back to business as usual and I remember none of the stuff we were trained originally. They finished others training but because my group had already completed two weeks of it they felt like we needed no refresher. They also introduced stats without informing us of what those stats entailed or how to see how we’re doing on our own. And introduced coaching where we just talk about what we’re doing wrong and if we’re doing anything wrong we’re told the higher ups are watching us. 

It feels like I’m constantly under pressure now to do everything right and I’ve even started noticing that other departments are just plain terrible and never want to take the call when I try to transfer them over. I.e. I tried to transfer a customer to fraud once because they had to go there and the fraud agent would not take the call. I ended up having to escalate them to my supervisor team and immediately they were mad at me for not transferring them. Besides that every time I try to talk to my manager about customers she is super nice about it but just brushes it off like “this is the page to find ways to deescalate a customer.” And this doesn’t even scratch the surface of how bad this place actually is. On top of all that, I get yelled at constantly and I just can’t handle it mentally. I once was told by a customer that she wished my entire family and everyone I knew and loved would get covid and die because I couldn’t refund her $0.14 international fee. I’m not kidding on the amount by the way, it just seared into my memory. 

I’ve started crying after calls which I didn’t do before. I also get so nervous to go in that I will spend the whole night dreading it and then wake up and just sit there staring until I have to leave. I’ve never been so drained in every way. It feels like everyone around me in my personal life is supportive in me possibly leaving and taking a pay cut but whenever I mention it to work friends they seem to react as if I’m just not doing good enough. One of my closest friends also works with me and whenever I bring up a problem I have she shuts it down almost immediately. I know that I should leave and have started applying to a few places, I’m also aware I’m going to take a pay cut no matter what. But I just can’t help but feel like I’m failing. I can’t stop thinking that maybe this is my fault and that maybe I’m overreacting. Or maybe I’m just not detached enough for a job like this? I can’t just not take these things home. It just sucks, it really sucks. 

While on the topic, what kinds of jobs are good for people leaving call centers that don’t have a degree? I’ve been applying for mostly mom and pop shoppes as that’s pretty much what’s around me that pays more than minimum wage but I want to get out of retail so bad.

You know you're lying. I know you're lying. Why do you do this to yourself?,"I work hotel reservations and customer service for a fairly big company. I have access to a lot of tools you might not assume I need, but that are essential for my job.

TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

It was like 8pm. The day was fairly slow so I was not in a hurry and it's always fun to do some detective work.

A call came in and the system threw an account and a case at me right away. As I gave my greetings I read all the information I had in front of me and asked for the full story just in case I was missing some info.

The guy on the phone told me he had two reservations for Hotel X. According to him reservation #1 was for monday with a normal rate and reservation #2 was for monday and tuesday with a discounted rate, but he told me the rates were flipped by the hotel and he somehow got charged twice for the one day reservation. He also mentions the case I have in front of me and tells me he was looking for an update.

Now, the case was opened like 2 weeks ago and closed like 5 days after. No one ever contacted him and no refund had been issued at all. First clue something was off.

Second clue something was off was that he actually had 3 rooms at the hotel and one was cancelled. Did he mention the third room? Not at all.

So I ask about said third room and he tries to dismiss it. ""Oh I had another room for the 2 days and I cancelled it, but it turned out my kids did want to go to the hotel after all so I booked it again later. I cancelled that room several days before arrival, don't worry about that one."" and at this point I knew he was saying nothing but lies.

Room #3 was not only booked the same day as #2 but at the exact same time. I did not even have to look at the reservation history because the reservation numbers were consecutive and that only happens when you book more than one room at once.

So I started digging.

Less than 5 minutes later I had in front of me the full history of all 3 rooms, all the account information I needed and even the receipts for these reservations.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I found:

Room #1 was booked under the discounted rate from the start. Room history showed no changes to the reservation at all. Not made by us, not made by the hotel, not made by the person I was talking to.

Room #2 was booked under the normal rate from the start. Again, room history showed no changes at all.

He apparently booked the wrong rates for these reservations and realized way too late, he knew he could not fix it so he decided to pretend the hotel screwed things up so he could save a couple of bucks.

Oh and the extra charge? Room #3 was not only booked at the same time as #2 but after looking at its history I could see it was cancelled the same day of check-in... at like 11p.m. (That is, in case you are wondering, almost 24 hours after the cancellation policy expires.) This extra charge, and the receipt corroborated this, was a late cancellation fee of one night plus taxes. Not a mistake.

So here I am thinking something along the lines of ""Holy crap"" as I go back to the dude, who I put on hold to look all that up, and told him as nicely as I could that I knew he was making all of this up and that he would get no refunds. 

Now, he could have let this go and I would have done nothing. I would've just ended the call and moved on to the next person on the line because I don't get paid enough to care after a call ends, but he decided to be an asshole.

He called me stupid and a liar, he insisted all he told me was the truth and he demanded a refund. I again told him I would not be giving him anything (All the money he wanted was way over what I'm allowed to give anyway.), he yelled some more and said the magic words:

""I want to speak to a supervisor."" He demanded

""Sure thing"" I said

I could've said no. I could've said something like ""They have the same information I do, sir. They will tell you the same thing I just did."" and just ended the call but, you see, whenever I transfer anyone to a supervisor I am required to make a note on the caller's account. Both for whoever supervisor that gets my call to have something in writing about the issue they're about to be involved in (Besides me verbally explaining everything too of course) and for anyone else that receives a call from this particular person to know how to deal with them.

These notes, I might add, are permanent.

So this dude will not only be shut down by a supervisor, he will also have documented in his account that he tried to lie to us more than once and get a substantial amount of money out of it. And he was a top tier member of this hotel company's loyalty program, so he might actually have some pretty serious consequences coming his way.

If something fun comes out of this whole situation I will update you all.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Dude lies about things that are easily proven. Ends up with a permanent mark on his record and with no refunds.",758,1,0
Shamed for covid testing,"I’m just going to start this by saying my manager is, to put it lightly, a total ass - which I’ve been made well aware of on multiple occasions however he has now stooped to making me feel guilty for going to get a Corona test. 

The company has been a fucking nightmare lately after signing a contract with a major car company - which has resulted in an impossibly large workload for my colleagues and I to deal with. We all truly are trying our absolute best but eight members of the team are currently off work with stress. 

To make matters worse my boyfriend (with whom I live) just discovered two of his jiu jitsu team mates have tested positive for covid. I informed my manager straight away that I wanted to get tested to which he replied that I had no reason to Not be in the office as ‘third person contact isn’t a problem’, he also offered me oh so generously one of my vacation days so I could go get tested. I didn’t want to risk getting anyone Sick and so have booked a vacation day off tomorrow to go to the clinic.

When he discovered this he decided to remind me of how busy we are at the moment and that I should be more considerate of the workload my colleagues have to deal with - “don’t you think you should only get tested if it’s urgent? You know how much work there is to do and cases to close. I really don’t get why you’re doing this... it’s just completely unnecessary, your colleagues are going to be here working hard whilst you’re taking time off”. 

And now I feel like the asshole!! How do you guys deal with your terrible supervisors and managers?? I swear they piss me off more than the customers sometimes!

Kudos call,"This was the last kudos call I ever took, but it's memorable for other reasons.

A tech that had been with the company for awhile calls in to the supervisor line and it rolls over to me, in the upper level of support.  He explains what happened and that his customer wanted to tell someone how he did a great job.  He transfers the call to me, and it goes like this.

Me - Hi, ma'am, this is Me, I understand you wanted to tell us what a great job the tech did on the call?
Her- yes, I wanted to tell you how wonderful he was.  We couldn't use the internet and he helped us get back online!
Me- okay, thank you, I'll make sure his supervisor is told, was there anything else I can help you with today?
Her- yeah, my son wants to talk to you.
Me- okay, I can talk to him.
---she puts on what had to be her 10-year old son.
Him- hi, I just wanted to tell you how great a job the tech did getting us online.  I play minecraft, do you know what that is?
Me- yes, I do
Him-  Im going to light off a bunch of tnt in his honor.  3!  2!  1!  (He makes an explosion noise and puts his mom back on the phone and we ended the call)

Needless to say, this was the best 'kudos' call I've ever taken.

I still laugh at this memory,"I work in non-standard auto insurance. For those who do not know, non-standard means we take drivers who other insurance companies may not take since they are a higher risk. This is usually due to people’s age, driving record, not owning a vehicle, etc.

Anyhoo, I got a man one day and I answer in my bubbly customer service voice and go through verification.

Me: Thank you so much, sir! How can I help you today?

Customer: Oh yes! Is my insurance still active?

M: Unfortunately, sir, it is not. It cancelled XX/XX/20 and it will cost $XXX.XX to reactivate it.

C: Okay, that’s fine. Oh, I have one more question. I have to run to the store and put money on a card. Can I have an hour of free insurance?

Now, I’m not proud to admit and I’m sure if the call got pulled I would’ve lost points for my tone more so than my response. But my brain short circuited for a moment and my real voice came through dripping in a tone that can only be taken as “are you f*cking serious?” Thankfully, he either didn’t care or didn’t even notice the shift.

M: **N o .** Sir, I cannot provide any free insurance for any specific timeframe. A payment is needed to have active insurance.

C: Oh, okay. Figured I’d check. I’ll just be careful and call back in a bit. Thank you!

M: No problem! Have a wonderful rest of your day!

I actually ended up telling my manager about the call one day. She laughed. The questions these customers ask will be the death of me one day. Hopefully it’s mostly from laughter.

“If I have to wait one millisecond it’s not worth my time!”,"So I work for a cell phone provider. Today a lady calls in to ask how much time she has left on her contract. Pretty standard clue that they’re looking to leave. I just let her know we don’t have contracts but the only thing she’s really tied to is the remaining financing of her devices. Then I just ask if she is planning on leaving and if so why. She’s really nice and let’s me know they’ve had a ton of signal issues and they’re in an area we have really well covered. I ask if she had ever talked with a member of our tech department to see if there was anything we could fix as they had been with us a really long time and I didn’t want them to leave if there was an issue we could fix. She, again very politely, says they have not spoken with our tech department. At this point I ask her if she would like to speak with them just to see if it was something we could fix. At this point her husband starts going off in the background “no not at all. If I have to wait ONE MILLISECOND to talk to someone it’s not worth my time. It’s not worth my time to trouble shoot and try this or that. If they want to call me that’s fine. But I don’t have the time to wait on them!” I let them know that right now we don’t have a wait for our techs and the only delay would be me explaining the issue. “Nope! If they want to call me then fine but I can’t wait on them!”

The One That Made Me Quit,"Hey all. 

So I started my job at a call center back in March of this year. COVID was just picking up steam and I had lost my temp job as a substitute teacher. At the time, I thought anything to get some extra money, especially when everything is as it is, would be good. That's when I got a call back from a fairly well known insurance company offering me a job. 

I jumped right on it. They sent me all the stuff to work from home and I was there the next month. 

Now I am an introvert by nature, but I had worked in a call center before as a political surveyor. I know it can be tiring and people irritable, but I always had a can-do attitude and I even managed to be the lead surveyor at that job. So I thought: this should be a piece of cake, right?

Well that's when I learned that I would be being taught in an entire class of people, with another class following behind me. In hindsight, this was a red flag, but I figured they must be expanding their business and need as many as they can get. 

So we spend the first three months learning the ends and out of insurance and after all that we finally take our tests and get licensed. Sadly half the class did not pass the test (50 percent attrition is also a red flag).

Now throughout the time that they are ""Teaching"" us, we are supposed to familiarize ourselves with their system for writing insurance quotes. Seems pretty intuitive, at first - just type in info and it spits out a quote, right? Most of it is just finesse. 

Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

I didn't realize what an ungodly beast this thing was until I got on the phone and kept getting calls asking things I didn't know about and constantly having to call my manager in for help.  It was stressful, difficult, and unproductive and I started to fear hearing the ping of an incoming call because I felt wholly inadequate. 

Management of course seemed to have had an attitude of ""well, you'll learn, so just do your best."" For someone like me, that was unbearable. And it seriously made me feel worse and worse the more quotes I took and realized I was way out of my depth. When I told my manager that I felt extremely uncomfortable he replied that ""sometimes you have to be uncomfortable to grow and you have a choice between doing that or not growing and staying comfortable.""

At this point, I realized why so many people are constantly being hired: it's a meat grinder and I was not prepared for it all. 

At last I got a call asking for a bind. A simple task - the previous agent had already done the entire quote. All that was left to do was confirm the details, get the payment info, and get it started. Easy-peasy, 1-2-3.  And I was almost there! Before the customer decided he also wanted a mobile home policy. 

What followed was a nightmare. We had not gone over mobile homes at all - only regular houses/condos/and rentals. I struggled through every step, trying my darndest to make it work. Having to call my supervisor on the other line to try to get me through this. 

After 2 hours it was no luck and my customer hung up and said he'd call again tomorrow. 

I had never felt so embarrassed, exhausted, and frustrated all in one. I was stressed and it was the end of my shift.

My supervisor pulls me aside and gives me a talk about how to ""take it easy and relax"" but ices it off with this: ""So, we're going to call him back tomorrow, right?""  


At this point, defeated and beat down, I mumble a pathetic ""sure"".

He pauses and then reiterates and says ""I need a solid yes or no.""

That was the final straw. I told him what he wanted to hear and rather than suffer that indignity again, I simply resigned the next day. 

Was that the right move? Probably not. But sometimes the money isn't worth it. I know moving forward I am going to try to avoid doing any job involving phones again. And to those of you who continue to work in call centers, you have my deepest respect.",23,0,0
Phone company nightmare,"Caller: I bought a phone in may and I forgot to check up on the installment credits, I was supposed to get the iPhone 50% off as a credit on each bill. The last rep I talk to  said he was going to take off the last 6 months.

Me: okay I can check for you! Okay sir you purchased
April 27, before the promo started. And unfortunately the credit was not applied because you didn’t qualify.

Caller: NO I did not, I should get it because it’s not my fault it wasn’t added at the store. 

Me: Sir I’m sorry to tell you but it was not added because it was not a promotion yet. I’m sorry to inform you, but your installments will remain the same. 


This guy was really swearing at me because he bought a phone April 27, saw that the promotion starting May 1… To get the iPhone half off… Just now decided to call In..... complaining that he never got it… But clearly he didn’t because he bought it before. Then he also was trying to get the $150 reward card but that’s only if you place the order online! It cannot be canceled and re-processed in the store which is exactly what he did.. good god.

Whoops! Answered with the wrong greeting,"A long time ago, 20 +years, I worked for an outsourced call centre company in the UK. We ran multiple accounts for different brands, including several tobacco companies free gift help lines, and a well known nation wide series of races for a research charity. Accounts with smaller call volumes were sometimes combined, i.e the same agent could get calls from different accounts, and had to check the phone to see which number the caller was dialing to ensure answering with the correct greeting. I think most will work out where this is going. ....

I  was a temp for the research contact, and after the races had finished and the sponsorship forms had all come in, most of us were let go, but the contract required someone to be available to take calls up until the end of the year. As this was now a small volume account it was combined with another small volume account; the tobacco gift line. 

I was the last person on the research account, (which remember I had been answering phones for all year). I had never yet taken a call for any other account.  I was sat there being paid for doing nothing, I read a lot, I folded letters and stuffed envelopes for other teams just to keep occupied.

Then after months of no calls , the phone rang, and I went into my by now Pavlovian response: 

Me: ""Big C Research ,how may I help?""
Caller:  ""Oh sorry, wrong number""  and they hung up. 

Thinking nothing of it I went back to my book. The phone rang again, again answered, with the same greeting.

Caller: ""Uuh I thought this was the number for the cowboy tobacco gifts?"". 

At which point I look more closely at the number coming up in the screen and breath out a silent ""oh shit"". 

Me: ""Yes sir, actually you're correct, my sincere apologies."" 

It then gets worse, as the caller identifies themselves as being from the tobacco company, and in fact being the person in charge of this account from their side of things, and could I transfer them to one of the execs. This I do and then sit and wait for the axe to fall. An hour or so later a lovely lady executive from the top floor comes down to my desk and tells me:  ""Well we nearly lost the account , but we didn't. Just be a bit more careful about checking the number next time."" and leaves it at that. Strangely they didn't renew my contract at the end of the year. Just still trying to work out the wisdom of sticking those particular two accounts together under one call handler???

TL:DR answered a call for a tobacco gift line, with the greeting for a cancer charity,the caller was from the tobacco company.",42,0,0
I have never lost sympathy and kindness so fast for someone,"I work in auto/motorcycle insurance. I had a man call in regards to his motorcycle policy other day and he was already pretty fired up but nothing I’m not used to at this point. For some extra context, our website allows customers to schedule future payments but 9/10 from what I get they always schedule on or after the cancellation date so it never gets pulled and they still get cancelled. Why don’t they fix this? I have no idea. But anyhoo…

Caller: Why did I get a cancellation notice?

Me: Well, you’re due date was 10 days ago. The last available date to make the payment is this Thursday otherwise it will cancel 12:01 AM Friday.

C: My GF was supposed to handle that. Didn’t she make the payment?

M: One moment, I’ll take a further look into this… Okay, so there is a payment scheduled but it’s set to come out the cancellation date. I can guarantee that the payment will not go through since the policy is set to cancel at 12:01 AM day. This will result in the policy needing to be reactivated.

C: GF get in here! Why didn’t you make the payment sooner?! I don’t need to be getting cancellation notices and sh*t. Wtf did you do?

GF: I set it to come out that day because I get paid that day. I had other things to pay for.

C: Like what?!

GF: Our car insurance, utility bills, groceries…

At this point the dude starts screaming at and berating her for spending money on groceries and such and not HIS motorcycle policy. Oh how it made my blood boil hearing this entitled jerk scream at someone who loves him enough to pay for his insurance. The worst part is I can hear the hurt in her voice as she weakly tries to explain herself to him. I have to sit there and wait for him to either come back to me or disconnect since he’s not being foul or a threat to me and a simple “Is there anything else I can help with today?” will not suffice.

C: Lady is there a way you can give us until Friday to make the payment? An extension?

M: Unfortunately I cannot as the cancellation notice is already an extension. 

C: This is bullsh*t. What company doesn’t provide an extension?! I know you can!!

M: I apologize, sir. But I won’t be able to provide another extension on top of the one provided by the cancellation notice.

C: Then get me to your supervisor! I bet they will give me one!!

Me: Okay. *puts caller on hold and calls the sup line*

Sup: Hey, girl! What you got for me?

M: I have man who thinks we can give him an extension when we’ve already sent out the cancellation notice which he clearly has seen. Shut him down.

S: *cackles* Once I stop laughing pass him through. I’ll let him know I don’t have a magic button for that.

I checked back later. He cussed her and his GF out some more, hung up, and made the payment online later that same day.

Edit: TLDR: man lost any sympathy or help he got from me by acting like a man child and screaming at his gf for not paying for his policy on time. Got mad we wouldn’t give him an extra extension on top of the one he gets from the cancellation notice, hung up, and actually made the payment later the same day.",682,0,0

Sigh.. what a day (call center adjacent short stories),"So...I don't work in my (health insurance) company's call center, but I consider myself ""call center adjacent"" because in my dept, we're always encouraged to help our members call into our Member Service line, as opposed to just giving them the number and telling them to fuck off, I mean, call on their own. I don't normally mind, but on days like today, it comes in so frequently and takes so long that I can't get to my other work responsibilities. 

See, while they have me set up to work from home, I don't have a way to simply forward a call to the call center, so I have to just stay on the line and listen in, because there's not much work I can do without my phone. Today is one of this days where I'm getting these types of calls back to back and it's really stressing me out. Here's two quick examples of the things I've had to just sit and deal with: 

1. Inbound call from a member I've known for years, says he's had issues making his premium payment so I offer to call into member services, get to the payment portal and let him punch in his info. Payment doesn't go through so I say guess we have to contact one of the reps, and work my way through the overly complicated menu to do so. 

The rep is way too but the book and practically yells at me for being on the line, asking why I can't just forward the call in, as if she doesn't know we're all working from home and my dept isn't set up like that, we use our business provided cell phones and not virtually logged into a call board. Takes about 20 mins for her to verify my identity despite the member giving her full permission to speak while I'm on the line. 

Finally she tries to address his issue, and completely missed the point. Ignores the fact that he tried to make a payment and recieved an error code, wants to jump into the online enrollment issue, but all she can say is ""I don't see you registered, so I can't really help you"" with the member getting frustrated and replying ""well I told you I'm not registered because it keeps giving me an error, so there's nothing for you to look up because I can never complete the registration!"" At which point I have to come back on and act as mediator. 

We finally move in to the real issue, trying to see if, for whatever reason, his acct being in a ""delinquent status"" is affecting him from making payment by phone. She CAN see an attempt was made, but offered no answer other than to try again, and for some reason seemed to be confused by what a debit card is. 

Member: I tried to use a visa debit..


Rep (interrupts) visa debbie? Idk what that is...

Member: no, a visa DEBIT card, I tried to pay the...


Rep (interrupts again) yeah I don't think we take debit, can you use the credit portion? 


Member: your system asked to make a payment by ""credit or debit"" and I tried to use my visa to pay...


Rep (interrupts..again): it's not Amex is it? Cuz we definitely don't take amex...

Member (very frustrated): no, it's a visa card, it's also my debit card, and I tried to...

Rep (yup... interrupts again): yeah don't use the debit number, use the credit card only...

Member:. Can you just transfer me back to the payment portal please? 

Rep: would you like to take a brief...

I had to end disconnect and calm this guy down and told him I'd get us back to the payment portal... We made the payment, no issue this time, thankful, but I had lost 45 mins of my day. 


Then.... Almost immidiately after, get a call from another member who wants to change his primary doctor. I say ""sure, we can do that. I'll have to call in to our Member Service dept, but we can definitely get that changed for you today. Before I call, do you have the doctors info? We need the doctors full name, address, phone number and if you have it, the NPI number would be the quickest method.."" 

Member: ""yes the doctors name is..."" 

Me: oh no worries, I don't need it. I just need to make sure you have it because the other dept will need it, so just hold on to that info, let me get them on the phone..

Member: ok so you need the address? It's 81..

Me: no no worries, just save it for the member service reps. 

I connect the lines, this time there's no 20 mins verification process because this person must have understood my depts role and knows we do this all the time. Speaks to the member: 

Rep: do you have the doctors name and address? 

Member: yeah, the name is Sonia. 

Rep: and the last name? 

Member: oh the last name? Uh... I'm not sure. It's Sonia though, at the clinic where I meant /u/easycure at to enroll

Rep: I need a little more info to look up the right doctor, do you have the phone number? 

Member: no I don't have it. 

Rep: I need the doctors full name to try and search it, do you have any idea what the last name would be? 

Member: it's a sonia...uh.. sonia... v________ (spells out a name that sounds very wrong) 

Rep: ok and what's the address? 

Member: oh ok, she had two, one (is) 87 south ____ and...

Rep: ok slow down a bit, let me confirm the first one, you said 2187 south ____? 

Member: no, I said one (is) 86 South ____

Rep: ok so that's 187 South ____?

(This went on for some time)

Rep: ok I checked the doctors at that address, was the doctor Sonia ____ (much simpler name than what he tried to spell. Literally added letters that weren't there)


It went on a bit with more mishearing and misunderstandings but by this point I was just done, mentally. I laid on my couch and waited for them to wrap up so I could type up my mandatory summary of the interaction and take lunch. Another 45 mins had passed, and when I notify my supervisor that my mid day quota is a big fat zero and he questions why, I just refer him to look at my calendar and see all the dumb interactions I've had today.

Filling a blank file,"(CW) ancient software discussion... so if this belongs somewhere else, I'm happy to comply!

Several years ago (1997) I began work in a software support center for a now-defunct game company. I had to study various games on different operating systems (Mac OS 7, Windows 95, MS-DOS) and sat in on experienced techs' calls to learn the ropes. One day I sat in with Bart (not real name) and a call came in for an older MS-DOS game that wouldn't work in Windows 95 DOS environment.

""Ah!' Bart said to the caller, ""I know exactly how to help you. This older game requires the presence of a file called join.exe, but this newer system doesn't have it. So, we have to make it. *cue: process of making a file* But the file has to have a specific content. You see, when Bill Gates published the file he included the name of his favorite dog from when he was a child, so we have to put the name of the dog in the file. Please type as I tell you: P O K A L I P H I K A okay good *cue: process of closing said file*. Now the game should run okay!"" 

Bart waited on the line while the caller tried it out, successfully! Me, on the listening end, could barely contain my laughter. Bill Gates had no such animal (at least not that we know of) and the caller lapped it up! 

FACTS: The file actually didn't require any content. The call happened as mentioned, the software and company existed as mentioned, and if you are the caller or know who they are, I gleefully apologize for Bart's shenanigans.",16,0,0

Prank call duck,"So I had the weirdest prank call a couple months back. Now this was for a company that sells beauty supplies like lip gloss and face cream. I should also note the holds were over 10 minutes due to limiting people allowed in the call center (we all work from home now) 

Thank you for calling the company my name is... how can I help you today. 

Caller: my grand daughter was telling me about this and I want to order. 

Me: okay no problem. I just need to know what product

Caller: well see my grand daughter is very smart is in schooling to get some degree (don’t remember lawyer doctor or something) and she was just telling me I need this  

Me: okay I need the product so I can help you order

Goes back and forth there were pauses in between his responses so I could respond) 

Eventually I hear ducks and he comments on them

Starts the cycle of his words again. Get to the ducks again. 

It wasn’t robot sounding at all I mean whoever made that has a lot of time on there hands. 

I’ve had some weird and gross prank calls over the years I’ve worked at call centers but that was the funniest and actually we started getting the calls again.",21,0,0
Just some tidbits,"So, worked customer service for a coffee company. People would call in to complain about everything under the sun to get their money back. One very interesting one included a gentleman telling me that his coffee tasted like goat piss. Dude I don't even want to know how you know what that tastes like. Another one that sticks out was the girl who called in trying to say she found an entire orange in her latte. She made her rounds with a few of my co-workers that night. I was proposed to a few times as well. It's been a good five years now so I don't remember all of the details but man I could have wrote a book.",22,0,0

What? We can tell customers that? Really?,"I worked in a Tech Support Call Center spent most of the day on the phone, yada, yada, yada.  


\*\*\*Background - a bit long, but needed\*\*\*

For some reason I got tapped to start attending trade shows as a technical representative..... I was supposed to masquerade as a Marketing Type working the booth, unless a Sales person needed me to answer technical questions.    Turns out I was pretty good at being a Trade Show Host (aka Booth Bunny) and the Trade Show team started asking for me specifically to work the shows.    It helped that I'd show up the day before, get my area set-up, so I could walk in the morning and start presenting.  


We did a gig show in New York City.   Huge turn out from my $emp, 3 times the normal folks working our expanded booth.   This time they had everybody fly in the day before, treated us dinner and a show.    Food was good, show was average, but the big part was a guest speaker.      


His opening remarks had me leaning over to folks at my table ""Oh no, a motivational speaker.""   However, he launched into a pretty good How to Work a Booth, Present and Control the Q&amp;A on the show floor.   He wrapped up by asking for show of hands for. ""Local NYC/New England area,  Midwest, West Coast, California? ""   Half the hands were California, another quarter were Midwest, and then the locals.    ""Ok New Yorkers, this is old news.   Local Area/New England, just a reminder.   Midwest &amp; especially California listen up. ""  


He then talks about personal space and has his assistant up.     
This is California personal space.  She stands 3' away.  
This is Midwest personal space.   She stands 2' away.  
This is NYC personal space.  She stands within 6"" of him.  


You can hear all us from California gasping.  


There is a solution, these are New Yorkers, they expect you to be abrupt and blunt.  
He mimes hands pushing away ""Yo!  Back up!   I'm from California, I need a little more space""  


If they start all talking at once just tell them to ""Shut up.   I'm the one who is supposed to be talking.""  


And a few more blunt tips.  


Next day I'm on the floor, using everything he taught us.   I'm feeling good, must be doing good, because I'm attracting a crowd.   They start closing in and I'm getting a bit nervous.   Its the Q&amp;A, so they are all shouting questions.   More nervous.   Then I remember that last bit.  


""Yo SHUT UP!  {they shut up, I put up my hands} I'm from California, I need more space"". {and the entire crowd took a step back}.  Not quite the 3 feet I'd prefer, but I did feel much better.    


\*\*\*  End of background \*\*\*  


Fast forward about a month, I'm in the office taking calls.   I get one of those customers who will not stop talking.   He's giving me good information, so I'm letting him run while I take notes and figure out the issue.    I get the point where I'm pretty sure what the issue and solution are and try to break in.   ""Sir...Sir....   Mr Smith.  ....   James...""   Look at his customer record...   NYC.   OK then.  


Raising my volume:   ""James, SHUT UP!""   {he stops}.  ""I have your solution, but give me one moment.""   {I did not mute him}.  I stood up, looked at my coworkers who were all prairie dogging ""It's ok, he's from New York.   I'll explain over lunch.""     


Return to the phone ""First time for your office?""  he asked.  


""Yep, we are in California with training to always be polite.   I however had training on dealing with New Yorkers last month as part of $conference.""  


""Oh then we met.""  


""Probably, but I met several thousand people that week.  


Got him his solution and spent the next several lunch breaks telling all the above.",658,0,0
Severe case of social anxiety,"To begin with... This isn't to ridicule people with social anxiety or other similar conditions. Fwiw, I'm a manic depressive. I'm merely sharing his story here.

Dude has an issue with his bluetooth headphones right earpiece having a crackling sound. I did troubleshooting and it didn't work (90% of the time we already know it's a hardware issue, but QA insists we stick by the basic troubleshooting first). So then came the time to offer him service options.

Me: Thanks for waiting. I appreciate your patience. Your options are to go to a store and look for a replacement right earpiece --  stocks depend on availability. Or we ship you a replacement right earpiece which you'll get within 7 business days.

C: I have agoraphobia, social anxiety, and [insert another socially hindering condition that I forgot]. I can't go to the store.

Me: ...Honestly, I'm a manic depressive and I have days where I absolutely just don't want to talk to people as well. I can relate. We still have shipping option.

C: I can't do that because you'd have to place an authorization hold on my card so you can ship the headphones replacement to me. I don't have that much in my account.

Me: That's true, there's a hold. It's returned if you ship the headphones back to us after you get the replacement. Instructions and box will come with your replacement. The web payment link expires in 10 days, so you have around 10 days to figure something out with the card.

C: Can I just mail it to you, you repair it, and ship them back to me?

Me: That's brilliant since you have warranty and might not have to pay anything except maybe the shipping, but well it isn't really an option. That's a process we only offer for phones and tablets.

C: That is ridiculous. Under [some legal Act pertaining to people with disabilities] you should accommodate me given my condition so I'm not at a disadvantage and discriminated.

Me: If I had the authority to make an exception, I would. These are policies set forth by people much higher than me. I'm not trying to make this difficult for you, again I'm on your side here, just that these are the only options we have for you.

C: Talk to your supervisor have him Google [law]. Under Section [x] read the entire paragraph.

Me: You're bringing legalities, so I'd like to inform you I'm not a legal representative of the company. If such a law exists you are most definitely entitled then, but since there are legalities involved you'd have to get a lawyer and have them contact our legal department.

C: I just want my headphones serviced. I have a disability that prevents me interacting normally!

Me: Okay, then your options remain the same.

C: I know it's not your fault, so your company doesn't have policies in place for people like me?

Me: I'm actually going through all relevant policies on my end for the third time as we speak to make sure I'm not missing anything out. Nothing here says anything about such a law or anything close to it... I only have instructions here how to guide you to contact our legal department since you've expressed sentiments along that.

C: [proceeds to copy paste the ENTIRE law, with every single section of it] 

Me: I'm really not the legal representative. You have to contact our legal department. I can give you everything you'll need to get to them, just say the word.

C: No, I shouldn't have to do that! You're required by law to adjust and accommodate me! I've been fighting companies for years about this!

Me: And I wish it hadn't been that way. I'd like to join you in the fight, so just give me the go signal and I'll detail everything you need to contact our legal team. (Meanwhile, I contact a senior because I can't gain agreement as per policy. These take place in chat including the customer interaction, if you're wondering.)

(Senior basically assures me everything I've been doing is already correct, none else can be done. I bid farewell to the senior, confident I can take it from here.)

Me: I just contacted a senior and they pretty much just said the same thing I've already given you. 

C: Can I just mail them to one of your stores?

Me: We don't have that process. You have to make an appointment and show up to the store.

C: Can you get me their email so I can verify? You really shouldn't be discriminating and refusing to help me.

Me: I don't see how offering you every single option still means discrimination and refusal to help. Anyway, here's all the info I have for the store. (store name, address, phone number, etc. no email) There you can see they don't really have an email address. None of our stores do. Only way to contact is via phones.

C: I'M NOT CALLING THEM! I haven't had a phone for years and phone calls give me anxiety that's why I took this via chat with you!

Me: You could probably borrow someone's phone and text them.

C: This number is a landline and not a cell phone number! 

Me: Apologies. I don't live in your country so I honestly can't tell an actual telephone number from a cellphone number.

C: So you're refusing me service, therefore I'm discriminated.

Me: We're not refusing service. Please trust us customer service people when we provide information and give resolutions. We've put months of our life into training and we never stop training on the daily. When we give you something, it's accurate and was done under careful consideration. My point being: all your options are final. I've done my part here and have fulfilled my role. I can't do anything that's outside my authority. These are the cards we're dealt, I can guide you how to deal with them and make it work for you, but you have to let me.

C: Get a supervisor and have them review the law!

Me: We are not legal representatives and again, my supervisor and I have already reviewed every policy we have. You have to contact our legal department.

C: (rant again of how he's discriminated)

Me: If you trust someone, have them go to the store and take your headphones. Have them provide the serial number so the store can check your warranty status. Have them bring your ID for verification. You don't have to personally go to the store. That's one workaround.

C: (ignores suggestion, rants again) Where can I get a copy of this chat transcript?

Me: (reiterate everything and educate him, then contact senior again because at this point I'm just tired tbh.)

(Another senior responds and advises me to just repeat everything. I raised him a policy we have where we low-tier agents can end chat if resolution is not accepted after three attempts. Asked the senior if I can end the chat myself or he takes over and repeats everything then ends the chat. Senior gave the go signal to end chat and provided me a positioning statement if I needed one.)

Me: Can I help with anything else? 

C: Yeah, get me a supervisor if they can do something else.

Me: I've spoken with two already and they have the same options I've given you. You may refer to my previous responses for your resolution. If there's nothing else, I have to end the chat here. I hate to do this, but I don't see us getting anywhere with this. I wish we'd met under different circumstances because you sound like a really nice guy, honestly. But, I must end the chat at this point since I've already given you my resolution.

And that was it. It's still baffling to me how difficult life must be for the guy.",44,0,0
Is it that bad?,"So I’ve been working for this tech company customer service you don’t have to have crazy tech cexperience($15/hr, mehh there’s many ways to promote though)
The training was pretty intense six weeks long and you get dropped if you miss more than eight hours. Now that I am on the calls we cannot have more than one minute between calls and expected to be typing in all the notes but paying attention to the customer at the same time and looking up how to fix their problem... there are no recording devices allowed in the call area including papers pens and phones Iwatches etc...you get surveys and you get coached on any negative surveys the upper level advisers can complain about you called peer feedback LOL The system is pretty complex I felt rushed through training and put on the line to take calls before I fully knew how to do some things. All the newbies sharing stories -so many have stories of people screaming and going crazy on them already. Only half the trainees made it through 

On the other hand bc of covid we are working at home so I’m sure it’s not as strict/intense as being on site. Since there is such a high turnover in training all the supervisors have been super patient and understanding like they are afraid to lose people. I have yet to meet a real jerk in the upper level advisers the supervisors or the customers. Maybe it’s bc we’re at home. It’s only been about three weeks on calls plus six weeks of training and I don’t know if it’s my voice or the way I talk to people but nobody has been an asshole to me yet. “Even the lady that I put on hold and told me she hoped I had an effed up day bitch” didn’t bother me she didn’t know I was still on the line and when I came back on she was calm. If Someone starts getting that nasty tone with me I just put them on hold and take my time looking for what they need.This work is a guaranteed 40 hours in such a shitty economy right now. The only problems I’ve had with this job is with myself not having enough confidence in talking to the customers and being intimidated about looking things up in the system and performing things self taught that I’ve never done before. Everyone is telling me that I’m doing great but I am terrified of every call- is this going to be the person that gives me the most craziest complicated request breaks me down and gives me a scathing review? lol my own mind is the problem with this job. If I know the system I think I would love it but I feel like I just don’t know enough yet. 

So my question is does anybody love this job ???has anybody had this experience like me where the customers were cool and it stays that way? Or was it cool and all went downhill? Is it just enjoyable to some of you who are able to work at home now? Is being onsite terrible? I got hired and trained completely virtual. Anyone love the custys but hate the work environment or vice versa?? Too many questions but please share what you want thanks

I was a waitress for 18 years I feel like that’s where you really get treated like shit and people getting crazy over the phone is not such a big deal",9,0,0
My Most Memorable Call,"I will never forget a call that I got a few years ago. (TW Suicide Loss / Depression)

I worked at a credit union, and this call was in 2016-2017. A Middle aged woman called in asking about an issue on her account. It was something simple like an online banking problem or an issue with a loan payment. As we talk she sounds kinda shaky and scattered. She starts crying suddenly and explains that her son committed suicide about a month ago and that she feels very lost. She explained how he was a single dad and now she is raising her grandchildren who are still young and she just felt like her life was spinning out of control. 

Now one thing that I did not mention was that I lost my 19 year old little sister to suicide in 2015. It was a recent loss and I had gone through an extensive amount of therapy afterwards to help me cope with it. Her death had put me in a spiral where I dropped out of school and quit my job to move back in with my parents. This call center job was actually my first job after her death. I heard the fresh shock and horror and grief for her son and I was filled with my own matching pain for a type of loss no one can really understand unless they go through it.

I talked with this woman for over an hour. I told her about my sister and she told me about her son. I told her about what helped my family deal with our grief and talked about how helpful therapy was for me. I told her that there was a local support group of suicide survivors (families and friends who have lost a loved one to suicide). She mentioned that a week or two before she had taken the kids to a local park and seen a group raising money for suicide prevention and honoring people they knew who had passed away. She said that the kids saw the group release a ton of balloons in honor of their loved ones and that they were all really moved by the sight of people coming together to do something like that. She had been sad because she wanted to get information to join that group but was not able to ask anyone on that day before they left.

I was shocked. My parents and I had gone to the park with that same group and walked in honor of my sister. I let the member know ""hey, my family and I were there that day and we were a part of that group you saw. I can get you all the contact information for the organizer and help you get in touch with their resources."" What are the odds that she would call into her bank and randomly end up on the phone with someone who had been at that park two weeks before? I gave her all the info I could and we ended the call. I never spoke with her again. Sometimes I think about her and I hope that the resources that I gave her were able to help her and her grandchildren. I hope they are doing okay.",305,0,0
Greetings,"One of my biggest frustrations is the greeting. We have to say this on every call no matter how I phrase it I frequently get push back. 

So the first part is fine. I have to give out my name, the company and ask for the clients name. 

“Thank you for calling ***** my name is marebear can I have your first and last name please?” 

I have worked for companies where you were able to pre record your greeting and it was nice. It gave you a chance to breathe before the next call and take a quick drink of water. 

Of course I always get the customer who only gives a nick name or just a first name and we have to do that whole song and dance. 

(Most of the time an account will auto populate. This annoyance is for the calls that doesn’t happen on)

Then I ask “can I have the credit card number or social security number on the account” it never fails that they will not wait for me to finish my statement before they start yelling that of course they don’t have the credit card number they lost it!  How idiotic of me to ask. But they can give me their social. Gee thanks. It’s like I didn’t even ask for that. 

I have tried variations of this. When I was new to this job I would only ask for the credit card number but quickly realized that would make clients angry especially if they had just entered it into the automated system.   Eventually I started to ask for social or account number but like with my current situation they wouldn’t wait for me to finish up my statement before accusing me of trying to commit fraud by asking for such personal details. (Some customers have even tried to convince me that it is illegal to ask for their social security number but that is a story for another time perhaps. ) 

So the best way is to ask for account number first then Social but no matter what someone will always be unhappy with that and not listen 👂 for the end of my sentence to hear the other option presented. 

And don’t even get me started on the people who refuse to give any identifying information. If they refuse to supply account number or social we can ask for phone number on the account but that is not always reliable if they don’t have a phone number listed or if a family member or someone else had been known under their phone number. 

Also tied into this is when they ask how I’m doing but don’t wait for me to respond they just launch into their problem. 

OR MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE: when they ask how I’m doing as a trap. They’ll be all friendly and nice give me all the information I ask for and then they’ll ask “how are you doing today Miss Marebear?” And the sucker that I am will be feeling all warm and happy to have a nice human on my phone who’s actually waiting for a response will say something like “oh I’m doing Great! How about you?” And then they know they have me. They can hear the smile on my voice and they say. “Well I’m doing HORRIBLE!”  And suddenly I’m speaking to a totally different person. 

Anyways I have tons of call center tales from the policies to the coworkers, bosses, and even lost loves. I’m hitting a brick wall after working on call centers for almost a decade and this may be a good way to let off some steam. 

Anyways if anyone has any good tips and tricks for getting the account details without starting World War III with your caller I’m always open to new technique. 😂",10,0,0
"If You Can't Give Me What I Need, You Can Just Hang UP","I work for an answering service.  Long story short, you know how you call the doctor late at night? Someone says they'll call the doctor and the doctor calls you? I do that with many types of companies.

This woman calls in, absolutley irritated. She is upset I need her name, company she works for, and a call back number. Apparently she has been playing phone tag with the owner. Now I could transfer her through no problem. If I did not get the information required, I would get coached on my mistakes. 

After about five minutes, she gave me everything except her company. She would not budge on this and gave me Toys R Us and other company names that would have no reason to call this company. I had been extremely patient with her up to this point. At a certain point though, I just let me shine through.

""Ma'am, if you can't  cooperate with me and give me your company name, I cannot transfer you.""

I know. I know what I did. But I like adding fuel to the fire at times. This woman loses it saying how she will not tell me who she works for. I let her rant for a few seconds before interrupting her.

""Well since you won't tell me who you work for, I cannot transfer you through. You have a wonderful day ma'am.""

Working for at&amp;t sucks.,"an abbreviated mild call.

at&amp;t me speaking. 

yes is this at&amp;t tv?

yes, do you need help with billing or tech support?

billing. 

ok how can i help you with your bill?

yeah i was told with at&amp;t tv i get 30 days free. 

at&amp;t allowed us to waive this charge cuz it’s a common lie. 

so i would waive it maybe 30% of the time. these refunds didn’t impact my metrics SURPRISINGLY. that’s why their shit so expensive. so if it was between a transfer and a refund i was forced to refund. 

ok and my internet bill just got more expensive out of nowhere?

the bundle fell off of your account. 

who did that to me?

no one. it was a system glitch. i’ll submit a correction on your behalf. 

ok and i see this services doubles in price after a year. 

yes that’s right. 

ok and i need the internet department. 

that’s me too. i can’t transfer. 

ok, my internet sucks. 

lists out router changes to make that they’re too lazy to make and i’m not allowed remote access to the router but i am the internet department. 

couple that with stupid floor support chat which i took many pictures of on my phone. the entire operation is a total shit show. 

ok and can you transfer me to a real supervisor?

all our supervisors can’t do anything.

what hell, man. fuck at&amp;t. i’ve worked for verizon too and much much much preferred them. 

the company is unprofessional and regressive.

another one. i can’t login to my account. 

it’s an unfixable glitch. 

can you get me to tech support?

they don’t have a fix for it. 

so i bought a service i can’t access?

yes. 

my latest qa person forced us to be radically honest which was kinda rough because att will tell you anything to get your money. i wound up quitting after having another job secured.

i will say that 25% of non supervisor staff don’t take calls. and they are so far up the other ones asses. just ridiculous. they can’t even answer questions.

also it takes forever to even be adequate at doing the job. everything is just ridiculously complicated and makes you sound dumb. i got proficient at the job a couple months ago or so and got really good at it a month ago. but everyone you get on the phone sounds like an idiot and it’s not really their fault.",27,0,0

You know sometimes you get a wholesome boomer.,"I work for a bank and this happened to me yesterday and it really made me think about a moment in my life that really made me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. Sometimes when the call gets off track and lead into other directions it really makes me think about the older days that have gone by.

After assisting a customer with website navigation he asked me a off topic question, he was a older gentleman who was never married.

Customer: Do you have dogs?

Me: Yes, I have two. One is a dachshund and the other one is a yorkie!

Customer: Ah those are some small dogs, I am glad I came across you because you seem to be a dog person. I am as well and recently I got a lab poodle mix! She is one of my favorite dog breeds since my old cocker-poodle passed away. Sometimes I think about what we would do without dogs.

From that statement alone I thought of a story that would never leave my mind and I told it to him. Back in 2018 I moved back home after me and my ex split up, I got home after one and a half hours driving and it was midnight. When I went into my room I sat down on my bed very depressed and sad about what just went down. As I was sitting there my dachshund walked in my room and sat on my bed right next to me, he went to sleep with me that night and every night since then he never really left my side.

Customer: That right there would make a grown man cry... that right there is how you know you have a great dog.

Me: My dachshund Maxx sits next to me when I work at home. He doesn’t like to leave his bed since it’s right next to my desk. When I go camping he does the same thing when I am fishing too.

After a while me and the customer continued to tell stories about our dogs and then after 45 minutes he had to go. I looked back at my dachshund who was laying in his bed and gave him some head pats because he is the best dog that anybody could have. We really take our dogs for granted and all the love that they show us. This customer really proved that some boomers are redeemable and that dogs deserve more live then they already get. If you will excuse me I think my dachshund deserves a treat.",85,0,0
just got off the phone with the smartest man in the world aka “ken from the cape”,"Guys I love you all. Unless you are Ken from the Cape.

You know how once in a while you come across someone that needs to be the smartest person in the conversation? I got a call where within 2 sentences managed to tell me they were in MENSA, told me their IQ was over 140, then asked me if I even knew what MENSA was...in what I call the caviar voice. Dude chill nobody cares about your IQ, at least not at your cable company 🧐

“I’m sorry what did you call for?”

He slowly fed me information using thinly veiled jabs over the course of 10 minutes while telling me his time was also worth big money (as a lawyer or dr no doubt, but I wasn’t going to ask)

everything the man said was either dripping with sarcasm or had a double meaning. 25 minutes in, it boils down to they had gotten 2 movie channels free for 2 years I could only renew one of them at no charge, and remove the other if they really didn’t want to pay. He didn’t want to get rid of either and wanted both for free

“You probably don’t *think* your a bad person” was my personal favorite. He even dictated a short little story saying “of course you don’t wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and say “I’m a bad person, I take advantage of the public” 😂 I rarely break character or laugh at someone being ridiculous but... wtf?

I hadn't realized how many people have poor reading comprehension and common sense until I worked chat support,"Have accumulated gripes since I've had a taste of chat support work. For what it's worth, I'm with tech support.

Often in the middle of questioning a customer to gather understanding about their issue or while troubleshooting, I'd get this quite irritating remark from customers: ""blahblahblah can you help me, please?"" 

And it's so weird to me! Jesus, duh, I'm already helping you aren't I? What did you think we've been doing the entire time? No, seriously, enlighten me. If I wasn't helping you already, then seriously what do you think I've been doing?

I've also noticed some people either can't read or stupidly decides not to read the entirety of my responses. So many times have they asked a question I've literally just addressed in my previous response or two. So many times as well that I've had to literally copy and paste what I had just sent seconds ago. Only then will they accept the answer.

Apparently there are also quite a large number of people who couldn't follow simple instructions. I could literally give step-by-step instructions and still they'd ask, ""so should I do [some dumb shit they think they should do that is totally not what I suggested]"" No, dipshit, I just gave you instructions! Remove the catheter pissing your common sense away and follow the damn instructions!

Another fathoming case of this is when I request two pieces of information on the same message: their email and how their name appears on it. Often they'd give me just one, usually just the email. I know I just have to ask again ""thanks, and how does your name appear on this email?"" But, seriously, why do I have to ask twice? I've requested those two information in bullet format already so as to emphasize and yet... jesus!

Then, there are still those who just don't understand verification. I just said I need your email and how your name appears under it. Then, they'd go all aggro and question why it's necessary. I can't help it but boy do I want to pull a Big Smoke and just go ""ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS GIVE YOUR DAMN NAME (AND EMAIL), CJ!""

They then proceed to complain how we've spent a good 20 minutes just going back and forth why I need these information when I could've been helping them already. Well, like I said the last five fuckin' times I can fuckin' help you, cunt, just that I need your fuckin' email and name first for verification which you could've provided in less than a minute anyway! Instead you dragged this shit along!

Then there are those who just can't accept the resolution they're given. I can't imagine how fuckin' spoiled and privileged these people must be with their lives in general. We don't always get what we want in life, everyone should know this by now. 

How many times do I have to say YOU. HAVE. NO. OTHER. FUCKING. OPTION. I don't give a fuck if you've time-constraints or won't have another spare device to use while yours is in repair! Your schedule and your decisions in life with regards to solving your issues is your entire fuckin' responsibility as an adult, I'm not gonna plan it for you!",110,0,0
Lady gives me a heartfelt compliment. I cry after in ACW.,"I work for a large p&amp;c insurance company. I’m in sales. I handle customers who are rejected or receive outrageous quotes due to things way beyond our control. 

Anyway, I’m speaking to this lovely lady from Georgia. I’m sure some of you know exactly the type I’m referring to. She was so warm and accepting of everything I told her even if it wasn’t what she wanted to hear. I shopped her rates, and wasn’t able to find anything that was a savings (on another subject, auto insurance rates in GA are robbery. I understand why but it’s bullshit). 

I’m a softie, so when I couldn’t find her anything I look up a few options in her zip code and get her the phone numbers to reach out to a few of our competitors. Just to help. 

As we end the call she starts telling me that when God made me he did it differently, and what a wonderful person I must be. All because I stayed on the phone and checked every possible option I had. She said she had spoken to many people that day and they all basically couldn’t wait to hang up on her. 

I started tearing up and got a lump in my throat. I had to spend a good five minutes afterward composing myself. I’ve had a very up and down summer just due to everything going on and I truly needed that type of morale boost. 

I think we all can think of the craziest stories because humans as a species just plain suck. It just boggles my mind that being treated kindly by someone In this job environment can completely change My day.",77,0,0
"Ma’am, this is a supermarket","This was one of the weirdest calls ever. 

I worked at a customer help (more like bitch) line for a huge supermarket chain. One night, as we’re close to closing, i get a call. It’s a pissed off woman. The first thing I have to ask is their name and location of their store. She ignored that and started telling me to stay away from her husband. She knew what I was doing apparently, and I wouldn’t get away with it. 

She went on and on about how she knew I was sleeping with him (she said she was in NY and I’m definitely not) and that I needed to stay the hell away from him. She called me a prostitute (she liked that word) multiple times and insulted me as I tried to bring her back to her grievance with our store. 

She was clearly mentally disturbed; I could tell by her voice it wasn’t a prank. I wanted to hang up but since every once and while she talked about our store, I couldn’t. Over and over I was berated for being a cheap whore. Eventually the call ended. 

Was that it? Nah. Within an hour she called again... and I GOT HER. These are randomized calls every time, so the likelihood of that is small in such a large center. Plus, when you call, you’ve got a long list of options before you even connect to someone. She went through long annoying options menus TWICE to call a random person a prostitute for doing her husband. 

I’ll never forget that lady and while i was laughing the whole time at the absurdity of it, I hope she got some help... or became an actress because DAMN what a performance.",87,0,0
Tales of a dirty toilet brush,"So, let me say up front that I don’t work for my companies call center, but work closely with phone agents. Basically I process enrollment documents for schools and do chat support for phone agents who have angry clients on the line. 

*chat received*

Me: “yada yada how can i assist etc”

Agent: “yeah so I have a document needing review if you can take a look. Should have been accepted.”

Me: “no problem! One moment while I take a look.” 

In our system, we can see all previous docs that have been submitted. We check all of them to make sure it was properly rejected. Keep that in mind.

Me: going through the different submissions of this document, elevator music playing in my head. 

Me: *reaches the final version*

It’s a photo of shit caked on a toilet brush. A thick, intact patty of shit. We had rejected the same document about 7 times in a row, and the final submission was a thick pancake of shit on a toilet brush. 

Me: yeah you’re gonna have to open a case about this one with HR. 

Agent: *closes chat* 

I am very sorry to the agent who had to make that phone call and I hope they didn’t have to see the poop brush with their own eyes.",26,0,0
Being told to log off early due to not enough sales due to the company's broken computers is stressing me out.,"I work in an outbound call center at home at the moment. 

In 2 weeks I've been told 5 times to log off for the day, saying I got ETO'd and to log on the next day to try again because I didn't meet the quota they set.

Issue is their computers are trash. They are old and take forever for the account details to load, absolutely everything lags, only one call comes before I have to restart the application and eats up the time when I could be getting back to back calls with the auto dialer.

Management and IT have been poking their asses so bad. They bluntly said its the computer and it needs to be replaced yet have not gotten back to me in over a week about getting a new computer. I brought it up again with IT and they said the problem is they have to give the new good computers to the new hires.

While here I am losing hours and being coached by management repeatedly for my unsatisfied performance when in reality is due to these stupid technical issues.

Not quite sure what to do. I've only been with them for about 4 weeks and it's been happening since nesting.",60,0,0

Why do people run to the bank immediately rather than try to work the issue out with the merchant directly?,"I already know the answer. Because they're lazy and don't think it's worth their time to reach out to the merchant. I've had multiple callers each day call in and want to dispute charges. After questioning them, I notice many of them either didn't even try contacting the merchant or called just once and held for five minutes before giving up and calling us. If they bothered making an effort with a merchant or even did research on where they made purchases, the majority of these disputes could've been avoided. One guy became upset with me because I noticed a charge he was calling fraudulent was with a merchant he shopped with and didn't like that I asked him to try to contact the merchant first before pursuing an investigation with us. ETA: He also said his card wasn't stolen. Okay, Kevin, have fun being potentially banned from that merchant for jumping the gun and immediately assuming it's fraudulent without even trying to contact the merchant first.

We're overwhelmed with disputes and fraud cases. Actually give the merchant a chance to assist you. If the fraudulent charge is with a company you regularly do business with, why not contact them and see what the charge is about first?

every day someone mistakes me for an automated phoneline,"i’m american but work for a british insurance company in the UK. i’m probably one of the only americans taking calls. 

every. single. day. i’ll take at least one call where i do my introductory spiel, and the person on the line will respond with:

**“MAKE A PAYMENT”**

and i’ll say something like:

*“great, have you tried out our automated payment phone line by chance?”*

to which they will respond with an abrasive and forceful:

**“YES”**

and nothing more. so, taken aback, i typically pause to collect myself and say - in the most deliberately human and un-robotic manner i’m capable of - something along the lines of:

*“... ah ok, might i ask if you found something about the automated line problematic, or is there some other reason you’re calling this particular line now after already utilizing the automated payment line?”*

to which they respond in utter exasperation with:

**”uhg... TALK TO A PERSON!”**

so i pause again and collect myself, then tentatively inform them that *”i am, in fact, a human being, not an automated robot voice.”*

usually this elicits a long drawn out pause, followed by uproarious laughter and apologies for rudeness, which i usually dismiss by saying - quite truthfully - that *”it happens all the time”* and that they’re *”not even the first that day.”*

other times though, i just can’t be arsed and don’t even bother correcting them, and just transfer them through to wherever they needed to get to, leaving them none the wiser that they were just interacting with a living, breathing, sentient lifeform.

though in this job, sometimes i even question myself as to whether or not i’m anything more than a prerecorded voice on the line.",1417,0,0

Give me a credit for blocking my card for security,"So, this just happened about half an hour ago. 

A call was transferred to me from our fraud team. They said she wanted a credit for her inconvenience, and when I asked what the inconvenience was, they said it was because her card was blocked for fraudulent purchases. 

I almost smacked my face into the desk right then. 

She gets transferred and this woman is immediately a Karen. Her husband was “embarrassed” at the register because HER card didn’t work. She gave him her card, he was not on her account as an authorized user, and the charge was blocked because he was out of state. So not only did the card not match his license, he wasn’t even in their home state and she had the gall to say that SHE was inconvenienced because her husband was embarrassed. He was embarrassed because he was a man and her credit card didn’t work, and that makes it look like they didn’t have money, so he had to pay in cash. And now he has to go to the bank *gasp* to get MORE cash out. And she wanted exactly $25 in credit applied to her account because our fraud system blocked a fraudulent transaction. 

She was so snarky and degrading through the seven minute call. It took everything I had to not be snarky right back. It doesn’t sound like much, but these callers have atrocious attitudes anyway and she was just the cherry on top. The supervisor I transferred her to laughed and said, “Oh, she sounds fun!” I wish I could have stayed on that call.

PETA is a joke. Us Brits don't care.,"Hello lovely people's another tale about my call centre that works for everybody and their mother, but often isn't permitted to say we're not them.

So this particular company whose call I answered is a luxury clothing company. Which - you guessed it - uses leather and shearling (sheep and lamb skin and fur) in our goods. The company does not lie about this is very upfront and also names the items after what they are made of.

So I've just finished a call a British Karen, who wanted me to give details for the competitor of the company I was ""working"" for. And wasn't happy I was providing it. I rested back in my lovely plump chair staring out into the streets, watching a pigeon wrestle with a cat over scraps of chicken. And the Asian ""Road men"" wolf whistle at a Hijabi lady whilst smoking... not fags I'd assume - when the lovely jarring beeping sound in my head set alerted me to a call.

Muff - Good Evening Fancy, Posh Expensive shop, Muff speaking how can I help?

Karen - Hi, love your accent whish I had it. So I've received your catalogue today and shearling, like what is that the fur?

Muff - Shearling is sheepskin, we have just wool items but its not just fur.

Karen - do you understand how distressing it is to receive a catalogue like this. You're in the UK right, this isn't the 60s you don't need to torture animals for their leather and fur.

I'm thinking inside, lady its a sheep its not fur its wool. Secondly shearling is from animals that were already geared for slaughter. 

Muff - I -

Karen - how you can be so barbaric, im with the board in -redacted state- PETA and we will be putting you on the list of stores not to shop at. Now will you remove my details from the mailing list this is just too distressing?

Muff - sure. 

I proceed to take details.

Muff - so as we are in the UK we print about 12 weeks ahead so if you could keep this in mind as you may receive another catalogue. Just discard it.

Karen - Can you bring this up with the powers that be, and tell them they'll be on PETAs black list. Its just disgraceful you would sell these products and so happily advertise them. You have no shame in the UK clearly.

At this point I've gone back to staring outside my window, watched the little old lady get stabbed by the 5 year old drug dealer. Whose Mum, Kelly, thought it was a wise idea to let him drop out of school before he even learned where was appropriate to piss.

Muff - Mhmm yeah will do

When an additional two inches matters,"If I’m lying, I’m dying: cardmember called in to dispute a charge. I locate it and ask why he would like to dispute the charge.

So he had seen some koi fish advertised online for sale. They were advertised as being 8” long. He ordered up a bunch, almost $400 worth. When they arrived, Lo and behold, they were only SIX INCHES. He called the merchant and merchant says that they can’t guarantee each fish will be exactly 8” long, there can be a leeway of 2” smaller or bigger, which I think is completely reasonable, given that fish are not mass produced in a factory. Cardmember is upset because all of his are smaller, and wants his purchase cost prorated. 

I wish I could see the face of the dispute team member that gets this.  “So, next case...two inches more matters, or just the tip, please.”  

 Of course, I can’t say, you’re an idiot, why are you measuring fish, and did you measure tail to tip or what? Apparently a fish measuring person only measures to the joint of the tail, not to the end of the tail.

So I returned to call centre work for lockdown...,"I took the job as a stopgap during the COVID lockdown as it was advertised as working from home. I thought it would be a straightforward job to get into and pay the bills in the short term. I’d done call centre work a while back and thought I knew what I was getting into. I saw a few reviews, and thought “Surely it can’t be that bad?” It was that bad!

To be fair, the recruitment process was efficient, and I was offered a job the same day as the interview, working on an energy company customer service contract. The fact is was so quick probably should have been a red flag, but I really needed the money, so I held my nose and took the plunge.

The training started a week later. It was 4 weeks working from home on Zoom and Slack, with 40 new starters. The trainers themselves seemed knowledgeable and approachable when I had specific questions, but the material itself was kind of patchy. The first big clue about the chaotic nature of the place was when the group got a new trainer in the second week halfway through the day, with no notice and she didn’t initially know what had been taught and what hadn’t.

Because the group was so big, I didn’t get more than one or two short attempts at using the training systems. We listened to some example calls (the bread and butter of call centre training), but didn’t get a coherent set of processes to refer to, and at the end of training I didn’t feel equipped to deal with even basic queries.

During training, I found out that the outsourcing company don’t pay their employees wages until a month after the end of the month worked - so essentially there’s a 2 month gap between starting and getting your first month’s pay. They aren’t the only outsourcing company who do this, but it’s dodgy as hell and it comes across like the company is avoiding paying you until the last possible opportunity. It’s almost like putting down a deposit to work there. After some chopping and changing of dates and figures, the training team were offered an advance of £400, paid at the end of week 3.

After 4 weeks on Zoom, we were bundled into the office for a week of grad bay. We were told to arrive 30 minutes before the start of our allotted shift to get set up, and that this time wouldn’t be paid. Everyone had their temperature measured before being allowed inside and we were told if it was above a certain level we’d be sent home – luckily, I didn’t find out if this would be with or without pay.

The manager on duty barely welcomed us in, and waved the group over to the far corner to log in. The building was empty apart from the new group and a few mentors. We weren’t introduced to anyone, shown around, or even given a health and safety briefing.  We were told to get on the phones to start taking calls straight away and put our hand up if we got stuck, which of course everyone did on every call.

We were told not to bring paper notes with us, which is standard in call centres, so I’d sent myself reminders on Slack and email for the dozen or so usernames and passwords we’d been given, as recommended in training. But neither of these were accessible from the office computers because of course they weren’t. When I told a manager, I was told to just “figure it out” as we were “being paid to take calls, not just sit there.” I was very tempted to walk out, but I swallowed my pride and gradually figured out my logins without locking myself out.

Everything about the company computer systems was locked down so much and so glitchy that it made it difficult to do the job. Little things like copy/pasting text didn’t work properly so it was very easy to lose customer details and reference numbers when navigating between systems, and screenshots were disabled too which made getting help more difficult. Random pages would fail to load, and the menu to switch between a customer’s gas and electricity accounts didn’t work, so you’d have to refresh the page, risking dropping the call, and find the customer’s details again. It was as if everything was designed to be as unusable as possible.

There was no opportunity for one-to-one coaching to get comfortable with using the live systems or call handling software – it was straight in at the deep end. From day 1, there was a target of zero wrap time and a maximum of 1 minute hold time which is completely unreasonable to expect of new employees who don’t know their way around the systems. It also means no-one had time to leave notes on a customer’s account, so if they called back about a recurrent issue, they’d have to explain it all again. Great customer service there!

Another manager appeared part way through the day to shout out the names of trainees who were using hold or wrap, even if they had their hand up trying to get help on a call. No reason was deemed acceptable. There was no time to learn or ask questions of the mentors to get a deeper understanding of anything. Some of the mentors were helpful, but others would give a one sentence answer to a different question before walking away. I also had a ‘coaching’ meeting in the office where a bored mentor read through a PowerPoint I’d already seen while she checked her phone, and then cut the meeting short to take a personal phone call.

I went half an hour over on my first shift because most of the mentors disappeared on the dot at the end of the day, while trainees were still finishing their calls. There was a surreal moment where most of the 20 trainees were sat at their desks with their hands up for help after the shift had officially ended, with only two mentors left to help. Two managers were still there but they didn’t move from their desks. The contempt towards the trainees was almost funny. I think it was at this point I decided I was going to do my best for the customers but not bother trying to meet the insane targets.

After a couple of days, we were told to stop putting our hands up and post our questions in a Slack messenger group and our mentors would answer them there. Meanwhile, names would still be called out constantly if a customer was on hold or a new adviser was using wrap time. The mentors often lost patience with the messages and would come over to explain in person anyway. They encouraged us to retrieve and hold the customer repeatedly while waiting for help so that the total hold time didn’t show on the managers’ screens.

On the Thursday, less than a week after starting grad bay, we were told to work from home the next day, and apparently any downtime due to technical issues wouldn’t be paid unless we could prove it was a fault with the company’s equipment rather than ‘user error’. If we had any downtime due to internet outages, we’d have to claim back that missed pay from our ISP ourselves. I don’t know if that’s legal, but it certainly shows contempt for the employees. Luckily my home internet behaved itself.

Because the only support was on Slack, a quick glance to check or clarify something became a frantic 5-10-minute flurry of messages while the customer was waiting on the line. Meanwhile, I would be getting messages from other mentors or managers (I still don’t know who was who) asking why I had a customer on hold. I even had mentors call my mobile and leave voicemails to check up on me, which I missed because I was, shockingly, at work taking calls.

I knew from the first call that I hadn’t been given the knowledge, tools, or support to do the job, and when customers complained to me about the problems they’d had with the energy company (i.e. the outsource company I was working for), I couldn’t in good conscience disagree with them. When I tried to investigate and fix long standing problems that customers had called about 3 or 4 times, I would get harassed for taking too long. The culture encouraged passing the buck, token gestures, and getting the customer off the phone as quick as possible. All call centres have targets, but this place seemed to value everything above helping the customers and allowing the employees to do it.

After a couple of weeks taking calls, I realised that I wanted no part of it anymore and went to hand in my resignation. But even this wasn’t as easy as it would first seem! I didn’t have a manager assigned to me yet, or if I did I hadn’t been told who it was. So I emailed the trainer who was listed as my line manager before noticing she hadn’t been online all week and remembering she on holiday. So I emailed another trainer/manager who said she would call me, but didn’t, and then told me to email a different manager who would call me and so far hasn’t.

As of writing this, it’s been two days and my resignation hasn’t been accepted or acknowledged. So, I guess I’m just… leaving? I’ve worked a few jobs I’ve hated, but always agreed to work my notice period as a matter of principle but they don’t seem to care.

The managers were rude and dismissive, as were some of the mentors, and there was a general air of demoralisation, disorganisation, and chaos about the place. It was the Fawlty Towers of call centres and I won’t miss it.

Told customer got to hell,"I work at a home warranty and a customer called in and I advised her that we will be covering $475 out of her $700 repair for her plumbing .

She says that she doesn’t want to pay anything and wants to speak to someone else because she doesn’t want to use the plumber through our warranty. We are not able to transfer (even if I did another rep would tell her the same thing) She was being really sassy so I told her she can hang up and call back.  Then she’s say “And you got to hell”.

Caller saved the life of a call handler,"So back when I worked at Chico’s, I showed up to work one day to see an ambulance leaving the facility

I went to my work station and asked my co-worker what was going on. She told me this:

A phone call had come in and one of the call handler’s had answered it and it was a woman placing an order for clothing and they were talking and having a good time discussing the clothing and placing the order, and the customer noticed that the call handler started slurring her words and not responding.

The customer got concerned and had her daughter call on her cell phone and when the daughter got a call handler she told him that her mother was on another line with a coworker and that her mother thought the coworker was having a stroke or a heart attack. So they got a supervisor on the line and the supervisor had a cordless phone and walked through the call center talking to the daughter and asking her to let her know when her mother could hear her talking in the background.

It took them a few minutes but they eventually found the call handler who indeed was having either a stroke or heart attack, I don’t know which. But they were able to then call an ambulance and get her taken to the hospital and she survived.

Faith in humanity restored. Because the customer could’ve thought the person was drunk or some shit and just hung up but instead she was concerned and stayed on the line long enough to where she could identify where they were so they could find the person that was in distress.

I finally left my home warranty job...,"I finally left my “American horror story”home warranty company on monday after being there for over a year.


I have had trouble trying to lie to customers and tell them “American Horror Story” has their best interest at heart when in reality that is far from the truth, I have had to have calls where elderly people at the age of 80 or 90 struggle to deal with the Arizona heat without ac for months because either A.) One of our many lovely contractors who use any reason other than themselves to blame for not sending in the diagnosis for months at a time which we let them get away with, B.) Because authorizations were in the middle of confirming a diagnosis from the technician but the tech hung up in the middle of diagnosis process and autho did not bother to just call the tech back to finish the work order. and finally C.) Because even though you tell contractor relations that a tech is not following the guidelines that they agreed to when they decided to work with “American Horror Story” contractor relations response is always the same response ""will email tech"" ""will call tech"" no- how about we actually help the customer and not worry about making our techs angry WE are the ones that pay these techs if we lose a bad company then so be it.

This job is stressful disregarding the fact that customer service is doing everything (and nothing) for these customers , it's also the fact that every day it's the same thing I have to lie to people, I have to make up something anything to make ahs look less terrible than it already is for the current homeowner. 


One more thing - It is a pretty bad company decision for the customer level to switch customer service to bpo sites only and I find it oddly amusing as a majority of my customer complaints and cancellations connect to bpo agents handling the work order at a point of time but I will not need to tell “American Horror Story” directors that its obvious they do not care for the quality of the customer service we provide and are more focused on saving money and taking it.

"'you installed the box, you take it out'","so i used to do callcenter work from home for a big telecom company. it was just costumor service but i had a priority in financials calls, but when it was busy i got technical as well.

anyway it was one of those busy days so i get a call from a woman. she's quite angry. her complaint is that we installed a 'box' and now there is water coming out of it.....

i needed some time to process this. so i just start asking questions wtf she's talking about. her story is that we came by yesterday, installed (what i thought was) a router, and now there is water coming out of it. alot.

so i ask her to take a look at the router and tell us what she sees. she tells me its a ziggo box. ziggo is a telecom brand here in the netherlands. but heres the best part. i work for T-mobile, we purely focus on mobile plans (back then anyway) and dont even have routers.

so i tell her, ""ma'm youre speaking with T-mobile, Ziggo is the one that installed the router. and even if you were to call them they cant help you, you need to contact a plumber'

she wouldnt have it. 'NO YOU INSTALLED THIS BOX, YOU COME AND TAKE IT OUT NOW' so i explain again 'ma'm that router is not ours, its from Ziggo and ur speaking with T-mobile, and even so that box doesnt contain water' and she once again start going off about how 'you' installed it and 'you' should come over now. this goes back and forth for a good 3 or 4 times

i was done having this pointless conversation so i just said 'alright let me transfer you to that department' put her on hold, googled plumber and forwarded her to the first one i could find.

"""I don't have to justify myself to you""","So
I had this older customer call in tonight. A ""manager"" offered a discount on the customer's plan that was incompatible with his plan type. I reached out to my support and they found a way to change only his one phone plan and effectively give him the same exact plan features for ten dollars less. By making the change it would have resulted in a better deal than what was originally offered by the manager.

When I tried to explain the proposed solution to him, he EXPLODED with rage. ""DON'T CHANGE MY PLAN!"" I asked him why he was uncomfortable with the plan change to which he rudely shouted ""I DON'T HAVE TO JUSTIFY MYSELF TO YOU"". He ended the call by saying that if I wasn't willing to give him the 5 dollar credit he was incorrectly offered, that he wanted my call reference number and that he'd call back tomorrow to speak to a manager about me. I asked him in a bit of a passive aggressive way ""so just so I'm clear sir: you don't want to change your plan and would prefer to continue to pay more than you would if you did the change?""

He obviously couldn't justify himself because he was being irrational and honestly mental. I don't mean to sound ageist but I never get a young person who shouts at me because of something like that.

So I got thrown under the bus for asking questions during training,"So I've been in tears all morning. I just started this job two weeks ago on Aug. 31. I was excited because it's not tech support (something that has sucked out my soul). I'm taking messages for people via an answering service for doctor offices, lawyers after hours. Things like that. 

So it's all virtual. The actual office is in another city five hours away. So it's not like I report to anyone. 

Anyway, so two weeks of boring training through the headset and power points all while being at home. Which I'm not a fan of, TBH, but it's all I can find during these covid times. 

So yesterday, Monday is our first day on the phones. We're communicating to the trainer through a team chat. She says, if we ask her questions she will help us by screen sharing, etc. Ok, so all is good. I get through my day. 

Today we have the morning for more training on accounts. These ones are considered""level 2"" and are tougher. So after every account the trainer keeps saying ""did you get that Cindy? I know you were having difficulty yesterday."" .... Not kidding EVERY account we went over, even if I didn't ask a question.  At one point she even said ""what was it you were so confused about Cindy?"" What?!!Every account is different!!! Then she would add ""don't let those callers intimidate you Cindy."" 

At one point the trainer stepped away for 3 whole minutes and while she did that another agent came on the line and asked ""Did you really have that much trouble, Cindy?"" (Again, all through headsets and I don't even know this nosy ass agent) I responded, ""she's making it worse than it is."" 

Once again, let me reiterate... Yesterday was DAY ONE of phone calls. I'm not off training til next week.  The trainer even went thru a list of names and said ""I never heard from John, Bill or Paul. You can tell they have experience!"" Why? Because they didn't ask questions? I have 6 years call center experience and a college degree so she can go right to hell. (Don't ask why im doing this line of work with a degree... Long story)

So then the trainer tells us she's ""setting"" us up to take calls and some we're ready for level 2 and some are not. She said she has to ""code people"" for it. So... She left me on a slower que? WTF ?  I've been getting one call every 15 minutes or so. 

So now I've got it in my head that I'm getting fired. Guys, I did not do anything wrong with an account, so I don't need this hand holding. I just asked questions because it's all new!! Like, wut ???

Then that same nosy agent keeps writing me over the chat ""are you feeling confident today Cindy?"" I won't write back. I won't ask anything until spoken to. 

I feel singled out big time.  If I didn't have a husband or a baby, I think I would have just quit on the lunch break and wrote a nasty email. I guess I'd rather do something right with a Dr account than fuck it up, but whatever.",60,0,0
"I'll miss you, travel agency.","Won't say who and when, but I was laid off recently. Travel just isn't the industry to be in this year; the writing was sadly on the wall.

While it's still fresh to me, I thought I'd share some of my experiences. Basically, I was the person you'd call if you reserved a hotel using a certain 3rd party platform and had any questions/concerns. Date changes, requests like an extra bed, up to more tense matters like when a hotel is overbooked or complaints or more recently, travel complications directly related to covid. 

Some calls were just so satisfying, like when I managed to bail someone out a steep cancellation fee because of a last-minute family crisis, or when I successfully manage to negotiate compensation when a hotel misses the mark. I love when I'm able to be a source of relief during more stressful situations where perhaps an overbooking happened and the person has financial issues limiting their options because a preauth for the overbooked hotel already got processed. But I'd always go out of my way for them, you do what you gotta do and give benefit of the doubt when they raise their voice. This job, you just...you build a bond when you're finding out about these travel troubles, you might talk to their family and overhear details about their lives. I feel involved, I want to be a positive source in this moment for them.

And the fact that I got calls from all over the world really kept me on my toes. Adjusting all the time to fast and slow paces, quiet vs loud, formal and informal types, shy vs chatty, dialects, accents, decodifying heavily broken English (though the skill will forever impress me; English is an obnoxiously inconsistent language).

But of course, the job has managed to make me cry on countless occasions. Sometimes I did everything I could but maybe the hotel was overbooked and there were virtually no other options, no shelters, nothing that will work for their needs. So then I'm keenly aware that by the end of the call, that person will be realizing that they will not have a roof over their head that night and my heart hurts for them, so then it's so hard moving on to the next call. Worse still is if it's in an area completely foreign to them. Or there are children involved. Another scenario was when a person files a complaint because perhaps their room had heavy mold or there was clear false advertising (oh, the things I've seen...), but I was unable to negotiate fair compensation and they end up significantly wasting their money. 

But then covid became the new source of stress this year for the world. We started getting an uptick of calls from Asia during the month of January because there was this virus floating around and people wanted to cancel or reschedule. I thought nothing of it, felt bad that it seemed so prevalent but figured it would pass. By March, we were utterly slammed with calls primarily from Europe and United States, followed by Australia for the same reasons. 

By the end of spring, we had all but memorized what travel restrictions were all over the world because that's all our job was for a long while. What grace would we provide for hotels for complaints or commission concerns, what was acting within legal guidelines for the country, what about those with ambiguous policies, and so on. It was absolutely dizzying how much there was to remember. 

And then by summer, all the many properties who I've helped with guest relocations because they had to close permanently. And guests who had to basically be told to be patient because while we do have it in writing that a property intends to refund them...they just literally can't right now. And while we could refund on their behalf and invoice them, we...know that bill would remain unpaid. It was more important than ever to handle the mediation delicately.

In the end, I know that I've learned so much about the world and feel so blessed to have been able to help them where I could, get to know them, find wonderful locations I would have never otherwise known about, feel more like a citizen of the world. It breaks my heart that I'm no longer in the industry I thought I'd be making a lifelong career out of, and especially because of something like this. I'm gonna miss it a lot.

May travel be safer someday soon.",59,0,0
"So, I didn't press mute....","Today was the first day in my entire 12 year call center career that I thought i pressed mute, but didn't. 

I take inbound tech support calls for a large ISP/Cable/Phone provider.  I've been there for a few years, and I work with the training dept about 50% of the time, doing floor support for new hire training classes. The other 50% of the time, I take calls myself. 

As such, even while i'm on the phones taking my own calls, I usually get pinged a few times throughout the day via IM for questions from less experienced agents or even other floor support peeps looking for a second opinion or confirmation on various things. 

Which leads us to today. I was already on a call with a mildly irritated woman while we waited for a firmware update to go thru. Meanwhile, a guy that sits in the same cubicle row as me IMs me with a how do i/can i? Type question. 

I didn't really understand what he was asking me, so while simultaneously verbally explaining to my low key irate customer why it is that the equipment has to do this update to make the thing do the thing ect, I'm also typing out questions for coworker dude to try and get him to clarify what exactly he's trying to do in the acct he's working on. 


I still can't narrow down what he's saying to me, so I put my cx on mute and stand up in my cubicle and straight out ask him:

 ""What are you trying to do?""

And she has what type of equipment?

And you want to send her new equipment that can do that? 

Wait, what? You're trying to get what she has NOW to do that? What's the make &amp; model again? You CANT do that. That type of equipment doesn't have the hardware capabilities to do that."" 

All of a sudden I realize my own customer is freaking out. ""What did you say to me?? I don't understand what you're asking me!!"" 

And then I realized that it had finally happened. The day had finally come where i thought I pressed ""mute"" successfully but actually didn't.

Could have been way worse tho. I've seen people fired for failed mute mishaps.  

I apologised to her and told her that a coworker was asking me a question about an acct he was working on and I thought I had pressed mute to answer him but didn't. 

Luckily, she called down pretty quickly, and weirdly enough was wayyyyy less irritable for the rest of the call! In fact she was downright friendly after that. 

I don't know if it was the change in my voice...from my ""phone voice""/""customer service voice"" to my real voice of ""Wait, what??"" Or the fact that someone was asking me a question so maybe I knew what I was doing ect but she warmed up to me quite a lot pretty quickly. 

So I'm grateful my first botched mute wasn't all that bad lol",133,0,0
The One Where The Rooster Crowed,"Like a lot of agents, I'm WFH right now. There's a flock of chickens that wonder around the neighborhood causing all sorts of shenanigans. I work on a special call assist team where I mostly just help other agents through their calls and take escalations. I was on an escalation shortly after starting to work from home and the customer was definitely heated but trying to keep their cool when all of a sudden the rooster crowed his loudest cockadoodledoo right outside the window in the room I was working. We have noise canceling mics, but not noise canceling enough to block that out. 

I froze assuming that would've aggravated the situation even further but the caller asked while laughing if they just heard a rooster. I apologized and let them know that he's one of the 7 roosters that drift around and I didnt realize he was outside until he crowed. We laughed together about the concept of stray chickens and it completely de-escalated the situation.

Tales from the Overdraft,"It is unbelievable how much people do not keep track of the money they spend versus the money they actually have to spend.  All of these incidents occurred almost two decades ago, so the conversations have been written to keep the same idea, but are not going to be exact.  Technically, front line agents had the ability to waive overdraft fees, but ability to do so did not mean you wouldn't have a supervisor performing a colonoscopy on you if you waived one as an agent without an EXTREMELY good reason.

Please enjoy the below short Tales from the Overdraft.

A.

I have cut the typical call opening bs.

""Yes, this is Miranda from customer service in branch 2020.  I have a customer here that has several overdraft fees, I want you to remove them.""

""Ma'am, the branches are authorized to remove overdraft fees if they feel that the customer deserves it or if their was bank error.  Call center agents only refund in clear instances of bank error.""

""Ok, I am going to put the customer on the line for you to waive the fees.""

""Ok, Mr Customer, I do not see how any of these fees are bank error.  As such, none of them will be waived.""

""The lady whose desk I am at told me you agreed to waive the fees.""

""No Ma'am, the lady was told that call center agents only waive fees in cases of bank error.""

B.

""Yes, I am calling because a message was left on my answering service about problems with my account.""

""Okay Sir, I do the the account information you have given me leads to an account that is overdrawn by $250,000.""

""What was the last item that came through?  I do not use this account for much of anything.""

""It looks like there was a $400,000 check that came through for XYZ Industries.""

""Thanks, I must have grabbed the wrong checkbook when I send that one.""

C.

""I need to get an overdraft fee removed from my account.  It was caused by fraudulent activity.  They waived all of the other charges, but not this one.""

""Okay, l am going to take a look at the account for you.  Do you mind holding while I do so?""

""Please do.  I just want to get everything straight.""

""Madam, I have looked at the account.  It appears that the item in question was  recurring payment that posts roughly the same day each month.  As that was unrelated to the check fraud in question, I will not be able to waive that fee.""

""But the account was fine before all of the fraudulent checks came through.""

""I can agree on that, except for this one item.  Your end of day balance on Monday was 125.00.  This item and the fraudulent checks all posted on Wednesday.  This item was for $180.  This means your account was overdrawn even before all of the fraudulent items posted, and all of those associate fees have already been refunded.""

D.""Sir, I am a little old lady.  I would like you to waive the overdraft fees I got for the previous month.  I deserve them since I am a long time customer who has never overdrawn the account previously.""

""Ms Bluebell, I see here that you have been customer of this institution for X months.  During that time you have had multiple instances  of overdrafts on the account.""

""What do you mean?""

""Okay, you had 12 in February, 8 in March, 5 in April, 15 in May, 3 in June, 6 in July, 13 In August, 1 In September, 7 In October, 2 in November, 21 In December, and 9 in January.  According to our records, the only month you didn't have one was the month you opened the account.""

""So you will not waive any fees from last month?""

""No, as it appears that for each of the months you overdrew the account, you called to get fees waived.  Each time you were told you would not be getting any waivers.""

E.

""Mr X.  I noticed here that I received an overdraft fee last month.  Is there anything you can do about that as I am a single mother.""

""I can definitely take a look at your account history""

""Thanks, you can put me on hold if you would like to look into it.""

""Okay Ms Katrina, I see that the overdraft fee was for an order for Hooked on Phonics.  Normally, we don't waive fees unless it is bank error, but you have been a customer for quite a while, and that product was quite clearly something for your child.  I have already submitted the reversal.""",55,0,0
It hasn’t even been 40 days!,"Had a woman scream in my ear today how it was so unfair that her policy cancelled 3 weeks after the due date. Of course we sent out the cancellation notice the day after the due date yet it’s somehow our fault.

Specifically, she kept repeating that “it hasn’t even been 40 days” and that she’s a single mother in the middle of a pandemic. 

I checked the notes on her policy, there’s nothing showing that she’s called in saying she needed help or is being impacted. Honestly, I was more speechless at to how someone thinks that a company would automatically provide a 30+ day extension when most people pay monthly. On the end I apologized and explained that while I understand what she’s going through is stressful, this is what I can do to help her reactivate it today. And since she didn’t explicitly state that she’s been financially impacted by the pandemic, my options are limited.

Nope, no go. She was still hung up on the fact that the policy is cancelled and “it shouldn’t have cancelled!” Went on to demand for a supervisor since I couldn’t give her “a good answer” and my supervisor will tell her what she wanted to hear and fix.

She was not told what she wanted to hear and hung up.",41,0,0
"""This is a scam and I am reporting you for your ignorance""","Obligatory mobile warning and apologies for format issues.

This happened within the past hour and will not leave my head.  People call my line for a free bottle of a supplement.  I gather their info and start going into the upsells.  I have a few of them, but I try and get them done quick.  This guy, let's call him DA (Dumb Ass) for short.

Me:  ""I have an available offer that let's you get 6 bottles of this supplement for $171 as opposed to the $300 it would cost you to get 6 bottles at full price.""

DA: ""I would like to stick with the original offer.""

Okay, you could've just said no, but whatever.  Next offer.  ""Well then, here's an offer for 3 bottles for $85 as opposed to the $150.""  A little background, the company that offers these supplements demands every agent follow the script verbatim and go through every offer in pretty much all circumstances.

DA:  ""I would like to stick with the original offer.""

Me:  ""Sir, you said that already and there is no need to repeat yourself.  I only need a yes or no.  We doubt you'll want to pay full price if you like what you see, so how about I break that $85 into 3 payments of $28 and change?  And if you don't like it, you can return it to get that back.""

DA:  ""I would like to go with the original offer, are you going to give it to me or not?""

Alright, now I'm starting to get irritated.  ""Fine, then we'll just send what you called about, you will never be able to accept those offers again.""

Another product we offer is something for blood flow, seeing as help in the bedroom is a common thing we are asked about.  ""Now, if you want, we can also add something else to support blood flow to help in the bedroom.  Normally this costs $40, but we can send as a one time shipment for $20.""

DA:  ""I want what I called about, are you going to send it to me or not?""

Me:  ""You are the consumer, you are obligated to hearing different offers in case you hear something you wanna take, and you won't know if you don't hear it.""

DA:  ""That is not true, I do not want anything but what I called about.""  This kills me.

Me:  ""And while I get where you're coming from, let me try and prove you wrong by bringing it down to $10, 75% off-""

DA: ""This is a scam, this offer is a scam and this company will reported for it and for your ignorance.""

It's at this point where I want to reach through my computer screen and throttle this guy.  If you thought that, why did you call?  I drop all empathy and just jump straight to the wrap up:  ""Fine, then here's your total after tax, you will never be shipped anything else unless you call CS to order at full price, you will never be able to accept my offers again.  I am sorry you didn't understand that I was only trying to save you money in the long run, good day.""

I hung up on him at this point.  I have to deal with the type of braindead idiot every day and I do not understand why they are allowed to do anything.  You have zero common sense and you obviously don't understand english, why the FUCK are you allowed to have money?",0,0,0
Paper statements.,"I sincerely hate the idea that when you get your statement, only then should you pay. Especially because people act like it's not their fault. 

Like today, a gentleman was transferred to me, and he wanted all his late fees removed. Because he didn't receive a statement. And he'd gone and signed himself up for electronic statements. Now, for context, nobody at my company can set up electronic statements. We simply can not do it. It is set up by the customer. 

Now, I don't have to waive late fees for anyone. I can, and I will, but I really do not have to. He wants two late fees removed because ""I did not agree to electronic statmemts"". Yes you did. You set it up yourself. Shut up and let me talk. He got 2. Now, I could've been a dickhead and waived the lower one because ""well, one month is understandable, but you didn't think to call after not seeing a statement for two months? Can't do it"". But I didn't. I waived the higher one, got a ticket submitted for the other one (it ain't coming back as reversed). I explain this to him, and let him know that, worse case scenario, you don't have an extra 15 to worry about, best case it's like you never paid. That was 2 minutes of arguing. Finally, he gets it. 

Then he gets mad he can't use a card, which, fair. But we don't take cards period because credit cards and debit cards are coded the same way (the numbers mean things that identify brand of card, not if it's debit or credit) and we don't want people juggling their credit card debt on cards. 99% of people say ""okay, that makes sense"". This guy? Nah fam. It's a debit card, and he wants to give me the 3 numbers on the back. Like... that isn't going to help here. We don't take card. Eventually he decides to take it to the branch because I was losing my patience and I don't think I kept it out of my voice too well. Works for me. 

Next up we have the lady who just made me wonder how she functions. She didn't receive her statement (wrong address, go figure). She got a call earlier in the day from us, they fucked up her last name (it was a complex name), so she thought it was a scam. Which... fair. We are calling and asking for money. But we also don't have a pronunciation guide for your name, and we have maybe a second to figure it out. Now, she went online to be sure and then... made the payment. Online. Where her statement could also be found. She also wanted the late fee removed. And she'd never been late before, so, hey, fuck it. Plus, wrong address. Issue is, why did she need a paper statement in the first place? First guy? Kinda dumb, but he wasn't using our website to make a payment. He didn't even have an email with the account. This lady? Just... da fuck? 

Of all the things, ""I'm late because I didn't get my statement, but have access to a resource that means I don't need a paper statement"" broke me. Like, come the fuck on. 

Just fuck paper statements. I don't get the logic behind it in the first place. If I know I owe money, I don't wait till I see a piece of paper saying I owe money.",25,0,0
"Customer claiming as a Quality Assurance Specialist from another call center, audits chat interaction. Had fun annoying her!","I received a chat from this annoying customer, we’ll call her A, complaining that the refund processed by my colleague (B) was reversed. She’s requesting to refund movies btw. 

I checked the previous chat and B processed the refund properly and advised C that it was done. There are notes in the case supporting this and our backend tool confirmed the successful refund as well. A has been auditing B’s responses and told him that ‘you’re making a lot of mistakes on this chat! I’m a QA SPECIALIST!’ and acted like a total AH the whole time to B. She already requested for a supervisor at this point. She disconnected from their chat and contacted us again. Unfortunately, I got her. 

When I read what she said to B, I laughed. I don’t let them stress me anymore. As long as she plays nice, I will too. Just because I work for customer service doesn’t mean that I have to take craps from anyone. Even customers. There were times that I have been corrected by my customers and I appreciate it as long as I feel that they really want to help me and not b*tch about my mistake.

I explained to A that it was refunded and we don’t have the capability to reverse refunds. Told her about refund timelines and the reason why she cannot see the amount on our site is because the refund was processed already. I asked her to check if she can still access the movies. if she can’t then that’s proof that we’ve refunded them. 

She didn’t have any complaints about how I handled our chat interaction yet. 

Then she asked for a supervisor. Okay, sure. I advised her that I will endorse this case to my supervisor and she will be contacted within 24 hours. 

A: You’re wrong! I’m a QA specialist for a call center! You have to listen to me! This is for your own good! The right word to use is ‘FORWARD’ not endorse!!!

Me: (I’ll check with my QA and if I’m wrong, I learned something!) Thank you, I appreciate your suggestion. (I just really want to annoy her) I will endorse this case to my supervisor, you may expect her email within 24 hours.

It floats in mod air...,"Haven't posted for a while so here's another story from my role as technical help desk agent for a UK broadband company.

Customer calls in that she can't access the Internet. After usual spiel and following the script, the call goes as follows. Bear in mind this was 2007, before smartphones and tablets became the Internet devices they are today

Me: are you using a pc or laptop?

Customer : I sold my pc as I didn't use it anymore

Me: so a laptop?

Customer : but it's wireless, it shouldn't need a cable to connect

Me: true, but you still need a device...

Customer : that's what the routers for

We went around in circles like this for a while before she eventually understood that she needed the laptop back before she could go online. I swear she thought it would just come out of the router into the ait like Tony stark...

slightly fun call.,"so, my call center has put rules in place that basically force me to be radically honest with people. 

anyway, from today- 

cx - i have issue x. 

me - your issue is most likely caused by y. 

cx - after one hour of talking, he says i am being unexpectedly honest. 

then qa obnoxiously dials into the call, probably because i’ve been on so long. 

me - quality assurance has joined the call. In my most customer service voice ever, “Thank you so much for being part of companynamehere family and formal closing.”

now let me go off. 

the reasons why working in a call center sucks:

1.	you’re expected to disclose policies to customers which no executive has ever said aloud to a customer, ever. these policies are made by people who don’t have to deal with any backlash. 
2.	there are very few people who have mastered call center work, so you start the job with less knowledge than is required. 
3.	they want your transfer rate to be low, so you have to learn WAY MORE than your job description to make your numbers look good.",23,0,0
"Do you really have a follow question, or are you just....","A several years ago (eta early 90s) I worked at Hardware Support Call Center. Our phone system logged every call and was connected to the Ticket System.   So when a call came in our screens shows the information from the last call.

I noticed a pattern. One of our techs, M, seems to have lots of immediate call backs to confirm the information she had given the person.

M was our best tech and did most of the training for the new hires. However, she had a voice that could melt the coldest heart.

I finally started reciting exactly what M had put in the ticket. ""What of that do you need further explanation of?""

Ummm, Errr.

""Did you call back because M gave you the information?""

Ummm, errr.

""Just to let you know M is our best tech and has taught most of the other techs here their job. Can you please articulate why you felt the need to call back, so M and the rest of us can improve our service?""

Most of them would just hang up right then and there.

After a few of these, I turned around and found my Manager standing right behind me. ""Good job. Keep doing that.""

He had noticed my notes ""Repeated M's documented directions, asked what they needed help on, they hung up.""

He also made me tell the story at the next staff meeting. ""You all have permission to do exactly as OP did. Hell, be blunt 'Are you calling back because M is female?'""

Our call-back time plunged as we all started out call-backs with ""I see you spoke with X, what do not understand of what they told you?  Is it because X is a woman?""  If X was one of the women in our group, the calls almost always ended right there.",522,0,0
Despise is a strong word,"So, bit of background - I work in a call centre dealing with different type of orders; gifts etc.
I’ve never spoken to the IT department, I mean obviously we have them but my job is to just place an order with a customer or deal with a complaint. I can also change a password - but I can’t send password resets. I’ve only worked here for a short time so I’m still getting calls where I haven’t dealt with the situation before.

I had a “lovely” gentleman today with a complaint about the website. 

Me: You’re through to *insert name of company*  how can I help?

Cust: my name is *generic white guy name* and account number 123456. I have to say I really despise your website. Logging in doesn’t work, resetting passwords doesn’t work. I use the same password for years. The website is just awful and I hate it.

Me: I’m sorry to hear that, what I can do is change the password for you so that you can log in and set your own. Have you also tried logging in with the account number? Sometimes tends to be easier. (This is something a team leader has suggested, I don’t know why it’s easier compared to an email)

Cust: THATS NOT GOOD ENOUGH I shouldn’t have to make it easier for myself YOU should do that. I WANT YOU TO CHANGE IT

Me: *apologises again* as I said I can change the password but unfortunately I am not in charge of the websites so I can’t change anything on that side. 

(He then places an order over the phone with me)

Cust: I’ve just found this on your website after logging in with what you gave me, and I’d like to add this but I hate your website and can’t find the code *rants for 10 minutes whilst I find what he wants and then adds it* OH I BLOODY HATE THIS JUST DO MY ORDER AND THEN TELL THE IT PEOPLE TO CHANGE THE WEBSITE *yells his details at me and hangs up*

My epic 4 hour conversation with a customer that was assaulted by store employee,"About 7 1/2 years ago I worked in a call center for a clothing manufacturer.  It’s a company called Chicos, they also own the brands of Boston Proper, White House/Black Market, and Soma.

At the time I worked the 5pm to 2am shift.  Handled all calls, that is, sales calls as well as customer support calls.  I took the most epic call of my life one night.  We’ll call the customer Betty (for lack of any other name)

So it’s 11:55pm and I answer the call:

Me:  Thank you for calling Chicos, this is Kaideliegh, may I have your account number  please.

Betty: It’s 123456789

Basically I go through the verification process of checking name, address, telephone number.  Once I have verified it’s the customer I then can go forward with the call.   

Me;:  Ok Betty, how may I assist you this evening.

Betty:  (sniff) I’m calling to file a complaint against one of your employees.  I was at the store in (city) in Washington State, and she assaulted me!  She yelled at me and I am absolutely humiliated!

Me:  Oh goodness - Betty, please accept my sincerest apologies that this occurred.  We here at Chicos value our customers and this action goes against our very core values.

MEANWHILE, I’M PRESSING THE EMERGENCY BUTTON ON MY PHONE TO ALERT MANAGER ON DUTY TO LISTEN IN ON THE CALL!!   When this button is pressed, we know when a manager starts listening in as they would send a message to our computer that we’d see letting us know they were logged on.  I never see/get the notification that a manager has logged in to listen.

Now then, for reference, the call center is like the size of a football field - it is freaking MASSIVE!  I sat in the back row closest to the breakroom and bathrooms.  In the middle of the call center was a square raised platform that the scheduling team sat at (they monitored the call volume vs the number of employees and based on volume would offer to let ppl go home early w/o penalty OR ask ppl to work overtime).   Anyway, this platform housed like 6 desks, so it was a good size.

I quickly realized this call was going to be epic - hadn’t been trained on how to handle a call like this, but I knew anything that I said could and probably would be used against the company in a court of law.  So I was very careful with my words but also very sincere in talking with the customer.  
So back to the conversation:

Me:  Betty, if you don’t mind could you please walk me through what happened.  I’m taking extensive notes so that I can let my supervisor, her supervisor, probably the district manager, and whomever else know what has occured so that we can rectify this immediately.  And again, you are a valued customer of ours and I profusely apologize for the treatment you received.

Betty:  I had some returns to make of outfits I’d purchased online but didn’t like so I’d decided to go to the store to check out some clothes and return the online purchases there (which was totally allowable btw).  When I got there, the boutique was busy with several people checking out, so I asked if I could set my bag at the counter while I looked at some other clothes.  

Betty:  The sales girl said that would be fine, so I left the bag and picked out a few items to try on.  I went into the fitting room and tried them on, didn’t like them so returned them to the racks and then picked out some other clothes to try on.

Betty:  I told the sales girl that I had a belt in the bag that I’d like to take out to see if it would work a pair of pants I was going to try on and she said “sure”, so I took out the belt and took it into the fitting room.  It looked good with the pants I was going to get.  I left the fitting room, put the belt back in my shopping bag that had been sitting at the counter, and then proceeded to get in line to make my purchase.

Me:  Ok, sounds totally reasonable - what happened next?

Betty:  Well, when it was my turn to pay, the manager said I had to pay for the belt I was trying to steal.  I was stunned and told her it was one I’d purchased online and was thinking of returning but since it went well with the pants I was going to purchase that I would keep the belt, but wanted to return the other items.

Me;  Wait…let me make sure I understand what you’ve just told me.  You are stating that the boutique manager just accused you of shoplifting?

Betty:  (sob). YES!  She humiliated me in front of EVERYONE in that store!!  I’ll have you know I have no need to shoplift anything.  My husband is an attorney and does very well.  (she was NOT being a Karen at all, she was just stating a fact)

NOTE TO READERS:  So, the customer account that would pop up once we verified their identity would show us total sales for the  current Month, Year, and Lifetime.  I glanced at it and saw that she spent an average of $15,000 a MONTH on our clothes.  Yes a MONTH!  In her lifetime she had spent 1.2 MILLION on our clothes.  Yes, you read that right!  I’d heard of customers like her, but this was my first time running across one that was a high volume spender.

One other thing to note, was we could also see what their RETURN rate was.  Her recent return rate was a whopping 95%. So while she might spend the money, she only kept 5% of all she purchased at least for the past 6 months.

Betty then went on to explain that she knows she has a shopping problem and lately had been returning a LOT of purchases.  She confided to me that she and her husband of 30 years had recently divorced and he’d left her for a younger woman, and she admitted that she was using shopping as her form of therapy.  She liked to look at the clothes online and order them, but that they never looked as good on her as they did on the models.

Anyway, it took me a bit to get Betty back on track with her story (I realized that she was using me as her therapist at this point and genuinely felt sorry for her and since there was no limit as to the amount of time we could be on the phone with someone I just rolled with it - plus she’d mentioned being assaulted by a manager so I had to find out what the hell was going on).  
So once I got Betty back on track with her story:

Betty:  Everyone in the store stopped and looked at us.  I was so embarrassed.  I told her I had my receipts in the bag and could show her that I’d purchased the belt online and had thought to return it but was going to keep it.

Me;  Ok, then what happened?

Betty:  She told me that I was not allowed to return online purchases to her store and would have to mail them back in.  I told her I knew that to be false and they had to take the returns.  She told me no she didn’t and that I was to leave the store now.

Betty:  At that point, she grabbed me by the arm and shoved my bag of return items into my chest and dragged me to the door and threw me out of the store.  (Sob, sniff). She literally threw me out of the store!!!!  I’ve never been so humiliated in my life!  And she left bruises on my arm!!

Me;  \[reiterating what I said earlier about Chicos and valuing our customers, etc\] and profusely apologizing and telling her that no one has the right to touch anyone else nor to throw them out of the store for wanting to make a return.

At this point, 90 minutes have gone by.  Yes, amazing I know.  She was quite the talker and repeated herself alot, plus she would break down into sobs and cry and not be able to speak for a bit.

The headsets we had at the call center had like a 10 foot long cable on them so we could stand up and pace around our little desk to stretch and stuff.  During this conversation, I’d been standing up, pacing around to see if I could see a manager or supervisor or hell even a level 2 support person to get assistance with this call.  It was at 1:30am that I realized I WAS THE ONLY FUCKING PERSON IN THE CALL CENTER BESIDES ONE OF THE SCHEDULERS - and they were sleeping at their desk in the middle of the call center.

I could see on the call board that there would be a few calls come in and sit in queue and then drop after a few minutes - cause again, the schedulers had fucked up and let everyone go so it was just me working…..

Now I’d been talking with Betty for about an hour and 45 minutes at this point, it’s 15 minutes before I’m supposed to get off work - but I realized there is no way in hell I can end this call on time - plus again, she’d mentioned suing us, going to the media, etc., she was that upset.

I also had to pee.

Since I’d kinda bonded with Betty, I asked her if I could place her on hold for just a few moments - yes, I lied and told her I wanted to go see if I could find a manager.  She agreed.

I high tailed it to the bathroom and peed the fastest I’ve ever peed in my life and got back to the call. 

Apologized to Betty that I couldn’t find a manager and continued on with the call.

The next 2 hours, yes, 2 hours, of this call proceeded to be Betty repeating the entire story from start to finish to me.  I was working hard to not say anything that would put Chicos in jeopardy but also to let her know I was sincere with my apologies for the action of the manager.  I did manage to get the name of the manager from her and while she was talking some more I researched quickly and determined that it was the correct name for the manager of the store she mentioned.

I’d been typing everything she said (I type 120 words a minute, thank you 9th grade typing class!) and had filled out a customer complaint form, as well as noting everything on her account.

I was very careful with my responses (by that I mean I didn't say things like OH MY GOD, or GOOD LORD NO!). I stayed professional and factual and verified what she was telling me.

I did tell her that I had made a note on her account that the next time she placed an order via PHONE with us to give her a 50% discount on the entire purchase, one time.   She normally made her orders via the internet, but I wanted her to call in as I was thinking maybe talking to someone would be therapy enough and she wouldn’t buy so many things to then return them.

Anyway, it was going on 4am and one other employee finally came in the building (what were the schedulers thinking?  I was supposed to leave at 2 and they didn’t have anyone covering until 4am??)

My eyes were starting to roll back in my head, and after talking with Betty further I finally told her this:

Me:  Betty - let me reiterate, We at Chicos truly value our customers as if it weren’t for our customers we would be out of business.  I sincerely apologize for the actions of the store manager, I have filed a written complaint, had noted all this on your account, and have emailed my manager telling her to listen to this recording and to check my notes.  I don’t mean to be rude, but it’s 4am here and I was supposed to get off work 2 hours ago.  I’m exhausted and I’m afraid I will fall asleep on the drive home.

Me:  I need to log off Betty.  Is there anything else I can do for you?

Betty:  Oh my gosh!  Where are you located?  I though you were in California!

Me;  No Betty, I’m in Winder, Georgia, on the east coast.  

Betty:  Oh Kaideleigh, thank you so much for listening to me and making me feel like a valued customer.  I’m going to contact an attorney to see about suing, but I will make sure to not include you as you have been so kind and understanding to me.

Me. Ok Betty.  Have a good evening and take care.

I then spent another 30 minutes typing up everything and then rereading it to make sure I had all facts correct.

It was 5am when I got home - I was so damn tired.

I had the next 2 days off work, so when I went back in on my next shift, my manager pulled me aside and told me she’d listened to the entire call and she was amazed that I had handled it so well (I’d only been there 3 months) and that the Chicos attorneys had copies of the tape, that the incident was being investigated and that it would be handled from there.

My manager also told me that while I handled the call well, that the way I ended the call was frowned upon.  I asked her what the hell I should have done as the conversation was a circular conversation that just kept repeating and repeating and I was running out of things to say to placate the customer.  
She didn’t have a response to that.

I also told her there was no manager on duty NOR were there any other call handlers which upset her greatly and she raised hell about that (I think the manager on duty was hiding in an office sleeping)

A few months later I was curious and wanted to pull up her account to see what had occurred (ANY interactions with customer were to be noted on their accounts, even in stores if there was an issue).  

However I had heard that accounts were tracked as to who accessed and that audits were routinely done, so I didn’t touch it.  Instead I asked my manager what happened and she told me this:

It did not go to court, there were witnesses that verified the manager did in fact assault the customer and forcibly shove her out of the store.  Apparently the company gave Betty a settlement in the form of clothing she could purchase from us and not have to pay for it.  I don’t know the amount.

Man, just typing this all out exhausts me from remembering that night.",1351,0,0
"Damned if you do, damned if you don't","Who else hates the ""Customer is always right"" attitude of the management? My employer is a big call centre that is employed by various businesses to deal with their clients, i. e. for us the client is both the big company and their clients. In other words, we are screwed on both ends – we are like a middle man, can’t really do much, but got blamed for most issues from both parties.

Among other things, we deal with power outages. We have a neat questionnaire that we use to identify if the problem is the Big Power Company’s or the client’s. It includes questions like – is it a residential house or an apartment block? Where is the electric meter installed? Have you checked the fuses? Have you tried turning them off and on again? etc. To make the story short, we almost never pass on the info to technicians/electricians if the problem is in an apartment block – unless they say (we are not even allowed to ask, a client has to volunteer this information) that the neighbouring buildings do not have power as well. 

So, I have a call one night from an irate client from an apartment building, the issue is identified as the client’s not the Big Company’s and he screams at me for solid 10 minutes about how the last time it was the same, the problem was the Big Company’s, but the client was forced to call for a private electrician who did not do anything, but had to be paid, and the client threatened to sue the Big Company, demanded to be reimbursed for the costs, etc. So, here is the frustrating thing – the Big Company called, APOLOGISED FOR THE INCOMPETENCE OF A CALL CENTRE EMPLOYEE and reimbursed for the electrician costs. Oh, I was sooo mad when I read the Big Company’s reply. They provide us with clear guidelines what to ask and what to do, we follow the procedure to the letter and get blamed when the customer isn’t happy whatever the reason is! How don’t they understand that if they do this once, the client will expect the same next time as well? I don’t mean the reimbursement obviously, but saying that the issue must have been passed on to our technicians instead of the building administration or a private electrician. The best thing would be adjusting guidelines, but nooo, that would mean more work for them, I guess.",40,0,0
It’s still up to you to manage your ACW,"Oh boy, so I have another story from my outbound sales days for an Australian telco.

So basically, we were a BPO doing outbound work under strict instructions to not open or touch a customer’s account if they weren’t authenticated. However, the feedback from the client was saying that these calls from us were becoming impossible to actually verify that we were authorised representatives of the company.

The rule changed that with each customer we call, whether they answer or not, we had to leave a generic note saying that we called and to call x to discuss outbound offers.

We used Siebel for our CRM, and if anyone’s used Siebel, you’d know how slow and buggy it is. The issue became that we had to leave these notes during ACW. Now, you don’t have to be a genius to know that our ACW stats were blown for each person as they had to fumble around trying to save an interaction with each customer’s account, even if it went to voicemail.

When they changed the rule, they kept the ACW metric still at 8% but for everyone, it went to around 20% for the teams with this rule. Even if we were efficient, Siebel still would take so long to load an account and then to save the interaction.

When this was raised with management, we were told that it was still up to us to manage our ACW.

Even ones who were really good with their ACW, had their stats get thrown out and we were told to suck eggs and to do our job better, when it was quite evident that it wasn’t from poor time management or job performance when it impacted each and every single person. Still not sure if they were being a stickler from the client’s instructions or the BPO’s instructions.

I left not too long after this.",36,0,0
Cant see the forest thru the trees,"I used to work in the call center for Chicos.  One night I got a call from a customer that was upset the store from where she’d purchased a necklace wouldn’t let her return it.

It was outside the 30 day return window.

But….in looking at the customers account, I saw that she spent a million dollars a year on our clothes.

*blink….blink…*.yes, you read that correctly.  She spent a million dollars a year on our clothes.  Trust me, Chicos clothes aren’t cheap (check out their website)

AND she had **NEVER EVER**  returned any of her purchases!

She was an older woman, and by that I mean she was in her 70’s.  I could determine this as we had her date of birth listed (so we could send birthday discount card).

Her issue was she’d purchased a necklace 3 months prior and had just recently put it on.  While she was wearing it, the clasp broke.  She went to the boutique where she’d purchased it and wanted to return it since it was broken.

She was upset because they told her NO.  She told me that she was shocked because she’d been shopping with Chicos since they’d opened 30 years prior and was a faithful customer that loved their clothes so much she would routinely buy complete outfits to give her friends and family (hence that’s how she spent so much fucking money on clothes, holy crap).

The nice thing about Chicos was we were empowered to do whatever we felt was right and necessary to keep a customer happy that was reasonable.

It was an $80 necklace, like would it have really harmed the boutique to refund her money and keep a high spending customer like her happy?

I apologized to the customer for the boutique's lack of foresight and told her I was pulling up her purchase history.  I then found the date she purchased the necklace and was able to issue a refund to her credit card (which thankfully she HAD used a credit card on the purchase - I couldn’t see the number just that it was paid with credit card).  I then issued the refund, and asked the customer if she could hold for a moment.

I searched inventory to see if I could find the necklace (as it wasn’t listed online any more) and indeed found a store just a few states away from her).  I then called the store and told the employee that I was from the call center and needed to talk to the manager.

I got the manager on the phone and explained the situation to her.  THANK GOD she was  of the same mindset as me and knew where I was going with this.  She agreed to comp out the cost of the necklace and ship it to the customer for free. 

I went back to the customer and explained what I was doing, that she was being refunded 100% for the necklace and that a boutique in another state was shipping out a replacement necklace to her the next day.

She was flabbergasted and said she wasn’t looking for a free necklace, just that she was upset she couldn’t return the broken one.

I told her that she was a valued customer and that I wanted to make sure she stayed a valued customer and that she could keep the broken necklace or throw it away and that she’d be receiving a replacement in just a couple of days as well as her initial purchase was being refunded.

She asked for my name, I told her Kaideleigh.  She then asked what days and hours I worked as she would call in and ask for me to make purchases.

You see, at Chicos we were not only paid a very nice hourly salary, but we also got paid commission on all sales.  Just one purchase from her would give that call handler anywhere from $300 up to $750 max commission!!

And yes, I did get a few orders from her over the following months.  I didn’t always get her since I worked 5pm to 2am, but when I did get her call it was sweet!",111,0,0
This caller was an idiot,"Had an overall great day with few weird/mean/shrieky callers. 

However, I got a call from a cardmember who disputed two charges from a wine place. He was upset because there was a reverse charge on his current statement. Granted, the dispute, merchant credit, and our reversal for a conditional credit we had extended during the dispute were spread over three statements, but it was not rocket science. 

I explained the situation several different ways, but the cardmember INSISTED that we had handled the dispute wrong (we should have taken the dispute amount completely off his bill)and what we were doing is called “an Oklahoma shuffle,” whatever that is but I can surmise that it involves dishonesty of some kind. 

I even tried to show, here’s your charges ($80) and here are the credits on account ($120) so this is why there is a reversal of $40. Oh my!! He then goes off on how we charged him$120. 

He finally decided I was not budging and that he was a victim of a carefully planned and executed scheme to make him pay an additional $40. Yes, because my global bank needs your $40. I had to take a few minutes to wash the stupid off after this call!!!!",54,0,0
I volunteered to take a special project....was I nuts??,"I’ve worked in a call center for one of the biggest travel companies/entertainment divisions in the world for six years. I’ve been work at home for three. I’m in travel, specifically I work with travel agents, whom I love. 

Last year I took a special project with a company owned streaming service. It was in addition to my regular job, as extra hours. Same company, just extra hours. I only did chat, but I LOVED it. Maybe because chat? I dunno. 

So when an opportunity to spend the next three months working for our shopping division presented itself, I jumped on it. My new schedule is perfection, and there’s opportunities for overtime, which I can’t get normally right now. And I go right back to my regular job on January 2. Seems like a good way to avoid burnout and do something new. 

But I’ve never worked retail call center. Travel and tech support only. I almost never get yelled at (especially not by travel agents) and I’m great and kindly but firmly diffusing situations and enforcing rules.

wHy Is My InTeRnEt NoT wOrKiNg iN a LeVeL 3 eVaCuAtIoN zOnE?!,"This more a collection of various stories of my and my coworkers' experiences this week.  I work in Tech Support for an ISP on the West Coast. We support our own internet customers, as well as the customers of \~15 other local telcos/ISPs that are in this area. If you're not aware, the whole West Coast of the US is pretty much on fire right now. 10% of the people in my state alone have had to evacuate their homes. It's really terrible and really widespread.

My faith in humanity has already been sorely tested by COVID-stupidity, but man, it has tanked this week. So many entitled, selfish, or just plain stupid people.

One company we support has been evacuated from its main office most of the week. The local TV news channels are not working and those originate from equipment that is in the fire zone, so this company has not been able to get techs out to see what's going on obviously. The amount of people that are upset about this boggles the mind. Everyone I've talked to has internet, so they can get the fire updates that way, but they're pissed the local news channels are down.  We've heard a lot of variations of, ""Well, how am I supposed to check on the fire if the local channels are down?""

Another company, also in complete evacuation status, has had widespread internet and phone outages, due to the fire. My colleague had a conversation with an irate customer, who had gone back to her house (which was still under evac orders) and was mad we weren't sending techs to repair while equipment was actively being destroyed by the fire. She threatened to call the FCC to complain, because she found the situation to be ""unacceptable"" and ""Nobody else has this problem!"".

Another walnut told my friend, ""Well, I cannot see any fire here!"" when she was told about the outages and was recommended to evacuate, because of her proximity to the fire line.

That's not even getting into the conspiracy nutters. There have been rampant rumors flying that ANTIFA or BLM-activists are setting fires on purpose. While there have been one or two confirmed arson reports through all this, no evidence has been supplied that suggests any kind of link to this being an organized attack. Plus, there's the fear-mongering about looters, which again, there's been like 2 arrests state-wide for, but nothing widespread.

One guy told a fellow tech that they were refusing to leave their house under level 3 Evac orders because they wanted to ""protect it from looting"".

Yet another call had a customer that was apparently a **mile away** from the approaching fire and said, ""I'm not gonna let the media scare me this time!"" and had refused to evacuate.

I could really go on much longer, but I think you all get the idea. All week, we've been getting calls like this and it's baffling. I never realized how stupid people were until this position, because I'd never been talked to so many people before in my prior jobs. Lot more smooth brains out there than I ever thought possible.",63,0,0
"""I will not hang up untill I speak with a manager!"". Okay","Call from today, so it's still fresh. 

Some backstory:
I work in a call center for a large furniture corporation. As such, the rules on the floor are very strict and are non negotiable. One of these rules is you are not allowed to let customers speak with managers, you're supposed to negotiate with managers then report back. 

Due to CoViD-19 factories were closed and are having some problems picking up production again, which means some products are not in stock. Our company only let's you order products when they are in stock. This is a rule from upper global management. If done otherwise the backlog would be too much to handle. 


Onto story. 
Call comes in. Customer wants to order some small wardrobes. Awesome. 
Customer gives me article numbers. 

Me: ""Unfortunately, there are some parts which are out of stock. It's not possible to order them at this time."" 

Customer: ""Just place the order. I know you can order them. It's okay if I have to wait a couple of weeks for them. I just want to order them."" 

Me: ""I am literally not able to order products which aren't in stock. The estimated arrival date for delivery is next Friday. You can call us back next Friday then we'll be happy to arrange delivery for you.""

Customer: ""I don't want to wait until next Friday. I just want to order them now. I KNOW you can order them. So just stop giving me excuses about no stock and order them for me. My address is ____"". 

Me: ""Sir, as stated before, we do not allow orders to be placed when there isn't any stock. There is absolutely no way to order it at this time. The products you want are still in the store near your location. You can go there to purchase them."" 

(Deliveries through phone are done through a distribution center. This is different from the stock in physical stores. Products were still in the store nearest to customer but not available for delivery through distribution centre). 

Customer :"" I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE STORE AND I DO NOT WANT TO CALL BACK. I JUST WANT YOU TO ORDER WHAT I WANT. I KNOW FOR A FACT YOU CAN ORDER IT SO JUST DO IT."" 

Me: ""No can do"". 

Customer: ""What is your name???? I know you have a manager and i know I can speak to him so give me your manager!"". 

Me: ""My name is proteinrichpiano and speaking to my manager is first, not going to change the fact we can't order things which aren't in stock. And second, it's not possible to even speak to my manager. You'll have to do with me.

Tales of the Cruise Line.,"I still remember a sup call I took for a cruise line many years ago.

 There was this ""well known"" travel agent that would consistently hold hundreds of rooms and then keep calling to get the deposit extended.  Like in every cruise she book she never expected to have to pay for the rooms she held.  Usually this wasn't that much of a problem as the ""Revenue"" department would sigh and grip, but eventually agree to extend.

She got along fairly well for this until she tried for the 4th extension of a very popular cruise.  Revenue told her no extensions, and if she didn't deposit, she was losing the rooms.  The group leader in charge of all bookings for the ship for every sailing for the year told her no extensions, deposit was due ASAP.  All of which the front line agent told her on her call.  The agent still requested to speak with a supervisor to the deposit waived.

""You should waive the deposit because I book hundreds of rooms a month on your cruises.""

""No ma'am, you HOLD hundreds of rooms a month, but I have never seen you put any money down on any of the unbooked rooms you hold.  Both of the departments that could have extended the deposit timeline have already said you will lose the rooms if no deposit is placed today.""

""Well, you should still extend my deposit as I am still trying to book the cruise, and you will lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.""

""Unfortunately,  that is a very popular cruise, and other agents that actually put down money to hold their unbooked rooms are begging for additional rooms to be added to their allotment at significantly higher than the rate you have reserved until close of business today.""

""You mean I am going to lose the rooms if I don't pay in the next few minutes. ""

""Correct. In the future you might want to either hold less rooms or book a no deposit allotment which limits you to a maximum of 8 rooms total.""

&amp;#x200B;

She wound up losing all of her allotment for that cruise because she refused to put any money on the rooms she held.  She did start booking the no deposit groups, but that became a problems of its own as she would always wait until the day before the cruise was set to finalize before she would call in to add names to reservations.  Most of the time she would have taken money from her customers for several times the number of rooms she had in her inventory.  She never did seem to understand that we would not match the old price for all of the additional rooms as there pricing depends on availability, and the day before the cruise finalizes rarely had any rooms left to add at any rate, much less one much lower than the last rate available.",75,0,0

Some examples of NON-covered tows are, to tow the members vehicle from repair shop to repair shop because the member doesn't like the cost of the repair at the orig shop, towing vehicles to scrap yards, or towing vehicles from one spot in a parking lot to another, or from the driveway to street to unblock other cars and vice versa. Basically, if you're not towing it to a residence or a repair shop, then odds are it's not covered. 

Well this member must not have gotten that memo because she called and placed a call to have us tow her vehicle. But when she placed it online, it came through that the breakdown location and tow destination were the same so we had to call to find out why. Turns out the parking lot the vehicle was in, was getting repaved and she needed to move it from side to the other side of the parking lot. 

This is most def not covered and we advised her of that. So she starts on some sob story about how the car is her cousins car and her cousin is out of town and won't be back for a few months and the key is with her cousin so she can't move the car herself. We advised her it's still not covered and that we can't even tow cars without the key unless the key is lost or damaged. 

So she asked us to jump the car and push it for her.....yes she wanted us to jump her car without the key. We had to explain over and over why this wasn't possible because you can't jump a car without the key. So then she asks why we can't just use one our universal keys to start the car. 

She still didn't understand why we couldn't help her but ended up hanging up on my co-worker.",509,0,0
Do not spend money you do not have then call and complain about the bill.,"On the phones for a few years now and there are dozens of stories of entitlement, racism, and generally being the absolute worst version of themselves. All of that is normal but if there was one thing I truly wish I could say to customers it’s this, “Stop buying thousand plus dollar devices and complaining about not being able to afford your bill and the taxes you have to pay”. You are an adult, you made the decision, you pay for the consequences of those decisions. Just stop. I will explain it to you, and I will do it nicely, but I will make it very very clear that your few hundred dollar bill you are about to go into collections over is correct.

Third times a charm....for you. Not for me.,"I assist agents with polices for home/auto. This was a quick call, but it annoys me when people don’t listen, or think that the answer will magically change if they complain or repeat the question enough. This is one of those times I bite my tongue from asking someone if they are dense.



Agent: I was wondering if we could switch the effective date on this auto policy, they don’t need it until October. 

Me: The effective date can not be changed, we need to rewrite the policy. 

Agent: Okay, so we need to rewrite the policy. So we can not just switch the dates? 

Me: No,  the policy needs to be rewritten. 

Agent: Yeah I got it, but are we sure we can’t just switch the dates on this?

Me (internally screaming whole throwing my hands in the air): No, we CAN NOT switch the dates, the policy needs to be rewritten. 

Agent: Ohhhh okay, well I’ll talk to the client and give you guys a callback. 

I never disconnected so fast. It was a two minute call, but how many times do I need to say it? Sadly, this isn’t the rare occasion but the norm in this job.",38,0,0
Using a counterfeit card paid off,"Sorry for any spelling grammar issues I am on my cell phone. 

So I used to work for a bank in the fraud department doing live authorization calls.  That means if the bank asks the merchant to verify the transaction or if the merchant is suspicious of the card or cardholder they would call and speak to me. 

So one day we get a call from one of our merchants as when the card was swiped they was asked to call us.  First thing I do is to confirm the name and card number with the merchant.  The name of the card holder on the card is different.  After a quick check and chat with the store clerk we discover it's a counterfeit card.

I say I need to do a security check and ask to speak to the cardholder. 

The store clerk then tells me he's running to try and exit the store.  I'm about to ask the clerk for a description and to send the card back us so she can get a reward.

All of a sudden I hear a scream and some sort of noise.  I ask the clerk what was going on? 

She tells me that the cardholder has tripped and fell possibly breaking his leg and emergency services where on the way. 

Sadly my job was done and I had to end the call.",700,0,0
$10 Worth of Anger,"I just started a new job in a small town ISP call center. And by call center is was me and my supervisor answering phones. I was still learning where things were in our systems to look them up.

My 3rd call of the job (literally 3rd call I've ever answered for this company) is an instantly upset lady. She's mad because we charged her $10 for internet service. (She had a joint internet service option where she paid us $10 per month, and the phone carrier $20 per month, it was weird.)  Anyway, she was mad I was not finding her account fast enough for her and asked if we had anyone in accounting she could talk to instead. We didn't have that position filled yet so I'm as good as you can get for now.

I found out the reason we charged her was because it was her automated withdrawal for the month... She forgot about it, got all flustered and hung up on me. My boss was listening in on the conversation and he said ""The only thing you could've done differently is when she asked for accounting just put her on hold for a minute, then pick up saying 'accounting'"" and we laughed. Little did I know it would be the first of many irate customers over a $10 charge.",77,0,0
"""It's not my fault, it's your company's fault!""","tl;dr read the title

I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

I received this call back in July. The customer's husband was trying to make her a reservation, but despite the fact that the credit card was charged, they never received a confirmation number.

The customer called and was informed by the agent that the system never processed a valid reservation, and the charge should be automatically reversed in a few days. Understandably, she requested a supervisor.

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C: Customer

C: We're going to travel and my husband was doing the reservation for me. My credit card got charged, but I never received any confirmation, so I called this morning and they told me it would take like 4 days to get my money back. I already spoke with 4 agents and no one can help me with this, is there something you can do?

H: I apologize for that, let me see what's going on.

I see the unsuccessful attempts to create the reservation.

H: I noticed your husband tried to pay with a credit card that ends with 1234

C: Yes.

H: By any chance, is the billing address 12345?

C: No, that's not the right address

**Technical part starts here**

Basically, when a customer tries to prepay in advance, there's one field that requests the billing address. If you write the wrong billing Zip Code, the system won't allow you to continue. With that being said, there's a 50 - 50 that those funds are placed on hold. 

In the past this type of calls were a big headache for me because I had to find the reservation, document it, submit my documentation to another department and tell the customer that it could take up to 72 hours for the funds to be reversed. Not anymore though, earlier this year I was granted the ability to reverse charges like that immediately. Most of the time it'll only take a few minutes for you to see the funds available in your account, although I'll admit the system is not perfect, there's been some scenarios where the customer still needs to wait until midnight.

**Technical part ends here**

I explain the customer why the system never processed a valid reservation, reassure her that I'll help her with this, find the charges and reverse them.

H: Thank you for patiently waiting, I have successfully reversed those charges.

C: Thank you. Can you help me make the reservation?

*Sigh* Sure, whatever. I reconfirm the location, the dates, and luckily for her, the rate is still the same, 210 USD.

C: Is there something you can do to accomodate me for this inconvenience?

H: I do apologize ma'am, but this is the best rate I have for this type of vehicle.

C: There should be something you can do for me, this wasn't my fault, it was your company's fault.

I check for additional discounts, promotions, maybe a coupon, but I won't be able to drop the rate. The customer tries to gain sympathy by constantly reminding me that this is not her fault, blaming our company for this situation (which I had fixed) andplacing herself in some interesting scenarios:

C: But what if you were unable to reverse my funds? What if it was the middle of the night and I was at the airport completely alone without any funds? What would I do?

The customer was calling on July 08, the reservation was supposed to be picked up 2 days later in the afternoon. Amazing what some customers will do/say to save some money.

H: I'm truly sorry ma'am, but this is the best I can offer.

C: You're a supervisor, you should be able to do more. This wasn't my fault, it was your company's fault.

At this point I'm tired of the customer demanding compensation for this and reminding me that it's our company's fault.

H: Ma'am, those attempts to make the reservation were made by your husband, not us.

C: Are you saying this is my fault?

H: I'm not pointing any fingers, but we're not the ones who got the address wrong.

Awkward silence.

C: Do you have a supervisor, HenriquesDumbCousin? I would *loooooooooooove* to speak with them.

H: He doesn't take any calls, sorry.

C: Hmmm... well, thank you for being so *useful* HenriquesDumbCousin.

*Cust hangs up*

Of course she was being sarcastic, but I didn't give a damn. She spoke with 4 different agents, and while they were unable to assist her I fixed this issue immediately, so yeah, fuck her.

Less than an hour after that call, the customer called again. She provided an additional discount, and got the reservation for 208 USD, 2 dollars cheaper.

Hope she enjoyed her compensation.",64,0,0
Messing with racists....,"So I do credit card escalations,  and one of my least favorite call types I get are the ""I want someone in the US."" They are almost always some crazy, entitled racist moron.  I also hate how they come across like, ""I just want to keep jobs in the US!"" Like I'm supposed to get down on my knees and kiss their ass for being so generous as to single handedly keeping me employed while also keeping the economy going....  You're not a hero Karen, you're a racist and an idiot.

One of my favorite, (albeit cheesy) things to say when they ask if I'm in the US is to respond, ""well I'm in Florida and last I checked we hadn't seceded yet."" (I know, lame, but it makes me giggle.)

I had one woman who assured me, ""I'm not racist, I'm half Puerto Rican!"" And I was working from the office at the time surrounded by a lot of my friends who just happened to be Puerto Ricans, and when I hit the mute button to share what she said one of my friends asked, ""are you talking to my mom?"" 

My friend who sat next to me in my old escalation department had some racist old bitch complaining she didn't understand her accent because she was Hispanic (she barely had an accent though).  So my friend had to transfer and I got it.  Woman  proceeded to complain how she couldn't understand a single word my friend was saying while AT THE SAME TIME complaining about everything that my friend said that she didn't like.  

Another old racist bitch was being very nasty to the poor guy trying to transfer.  I notice with the offshore reps when the customer gets extra mean they can get nervous and cling tighter to procedure when they really need to just get off the phone without worrying about ""transferring correctly"".  Admittedly in the past I used to get cranky back at them and kinda shoo them off the phone.  NGl I really regret that and I'm trying to get better. 

 So this poor guy she was just being real abusive to screeching at him to get off the phone, repeating like a squawking parrot ""go away, go away, go away!""  and I knew he was trying to follow procedures and ask to be excused from the call.  I kinda jumped in and said, ""thank you very much for connecting Ms Karen over, you did a great job!"" And he took the door and left thankfully. 

Karen then immediately asks for a supervisor.   I try and tell her I'm a supervisor but she wants MY manager.  I can't get anyone to take the call. I explain I can get her a call back but I'm more than happy to help her myself.  She goes off, ""No!!  I am extremely upset with how you spoke to that guy! If you like the foreigners so much why don't you marry them!"" Bitch was trying to complain because I treated the offshore rep like a human being and not like a piece of dirt like she was.  I kind of stalled there but just skimmed over that and offered to help but she hung up mid sentence.  

Checked the acct later and she called back and filed a complaint against ME.  I would've loved to have been the team that listens to those calls because ""rep was unprofessional, treats offshore rep like human being instead of being a bitch"" is such a ridiculous accusation.  Needless to say I never heard a WORD about it.",32,0,0
The Day IT Wiped Out Half The United States,"I forgot about this until recently and it happened about ten years ago.

I used to work in for a call center company that was the middleman between patients and doctors finding patients places to have certain services like blood tests, x-rays etc.  So of course a major part of any call was getting the patients location and finding them the nearest provider with the best price.  Until the weekend that IT did a major system update.  Someone decided that our firewalls, filters and general security were lax and the update included increased maximized restrictions to prevent porn, spam and anything malicious from coming through or being accessed by the workers.

I wasn't a call center operator.  My team and I had a troubleshooting role making sure addresses were correct, latitude and longitude were entered basically everything about a providers location was up to date and accurate so they could be found correctly. The update was done over the weekend.......Monday morning rolls around and the complaints come pouring in....mostly along the lines of: Why does it say no results or access denied when I search these locations?  The agents used two systems, mapping geo search and general internet search to match providers, the team I worked on was responsible for the mapping because it pulled from the system data we entered for that provider.

Anyone know how many counties in towns in the US end in ""SEX""?  A lot, especially on the east coast because of the English influence.  IT had locked down everything include geographic mapping and internet search to the point where Essex County, Sussex Township, even towns like Intercourse, PA were completely blocked solely because they contained the word ""sex"" or a reference to sex.  The call center agents were freaking out, the call center supervisors were coming direct to my desk to yell at me because I couldn't keep up with the e-mail questions.  It took about an hour to figure out that it wasn't the system data - during which time scheduling volume went down and the number of patients whose files were put in the call back queue was skyrocketing.  Once we figured out it was IT..........well let's just say the fecal matter hit the cooling device.  I didn't witness it but I know the managers went to the big bosses, they all went to the head of IT and the IT department made was was probably the fastest system update and push out in their history.  Of course we all had to shut down and restart so the update could take effect which put everyone even further behind.  I don't think anyone got fired for that but I wouldn't be surprised if there were a few write ups.",591,0,0

Not sure if this is the right place but I already feel defeated.,I started working at a remote call center recently and I started training and even did my first day of calls and it was okay. It wasn't until I started getting old and broke people saying the company we refer them to took their money and didn't help. Like I really need this job because I need money and it pays well but today I got this old frail sounding woman who said she can't afford to keep paying the referred company anymore because they don't actually do the service they offer. After I got that woman I couldn't stop thinking about her and every call after that I had a shaky abound in my voice and it was obvious I was tearing up until I eventually told my trainer I couldn't do the last hour and a half today.

Do you believe in Magic?,"I work in technical support. More specifically, I'm a branch of customer service who fills out the ticket, then forwards it to technical support.

We typically serve contractors who need help installing or troubleshooting things but every so often we get the lovely homeowner calling in....

Got a very irate woman calling in who was upset because she was trying to register her unit. She sent the registration paperwork months ago but it came back to her as return to sender today. She's obviously upset as the 60 days has passed.

"Thanks for telling my boss I'm doing my job, I guess...?","I work in data entry for a health insurance company. It isn't 100% call center, but my department does also handle incoming calls for claims inquiries. I get a call to my voicemail today - a guy is calling to see if a claim is on file for his 20 year old daughter.

For those who don't know: I cannot, legally, release information about someone over the age of 18 without verbal or written consent. I don't care if it's your insurance policy she's on, it is her privileged and private health information.

So, he leaves enough info that I'm able to locate her file. I pull it up to A) see if we have the claim on file and B) see if we have any kind of written release to speak to him. The answer to both is no.

I call him back, and immediately know it's going to be a fun call.

Me: Hi, its (name) with (company), returning your call?

Him: Oh, good. (Proceeds to go on a 2 minute rant about how the hospital never filed a claim with us and how he needs to make sure its arrived).

Me: (when finally allowed to speak again) I understand, sir. However, your daughter is an adult. Is she available and can provide consent to speak with you?

Him: What? No, she's not here. Why does it f**king matter? It's my insurance coverage, and I need to make sure this claim is received before the deadline and I'm responsible for it all!

Me: I understand and I'm sorry, but HIPAA regulations requires consent for release of information to anyone other than the patient when the patient is, legally, an adult.

Him: That's godd**n ridiculous! It's my policy, I'm the one who pays you! The deadline is in two days!

Me: (ugh please shut up) Again, I am sorry, but that is federal law. I cannot give you any information at this time. Can y'all call when she's available and can provide one-time verbal consent?

Him: Now listen here young lady, you're hiding behind red tape. I PAY YOU and it is your job to tell me what I want to know.

Me: Unfortunately, my hands are tied and it would be illegal for me to give her health information out.

Him: This is some f**king bulls**t! What is your full name? What's your address?""

Me: My name is (first name) (first initial of my surname) and we can receive mail at (address).

Him: I asked for your full name!

Me: I can only release the first initial, I'm sorry. It's (company's) policy.

Him: This is the most ridiculous f**king crock of s**t I have ever heard. I will be sending a letter to your superiors about this! Do you accept email? What about fax? I want to make sure they get this!

Me: We do not accept external emails, but our fax is (number).

Him: You have been monumentally unhelpful today. Let your boss know to expect my letter! *click*

Like... this is my job's policy. Thanks for telling my bosses I'm following privacy and verification protocol, and not opening us up to lawsuits?

And the most ridiculous thing: the claim he's talking about that's about to hit deadline? We need to receive it within the next two or three days, otherwise it will fall outside of timely filing and be insta-denied. The facility he said she was seen at is an in-network facility that has a contract with us. Literally, if they don't submit it in time and we deny it, the provider has to write ALL of it off and cannot, per contractual obligation, bill the patient.

Do you kiss my Aunt with that mouth?,"I was working at a collections call center for a cell phone company. The job was high stress (we had EMS there at least twice a week taking TSRs to the hospital) and low paying. Most TSRs didn’t last more than a month before throwing in the towel. We were cussed, threatened, and fed every sob story known to man.

My favorite call came in ten minutes before I was to clock out on the day before my vacation. The customer’s cell number and account pops up on my computer with a red warning to trace the call, which lets me know that this customer had been threatening/harassing to other TSRs. I immediately hit the call trace button on my phone and answer the call.

Me: Thank you for calling...

Customer: Turn my damn phone back on you fucking bitch.

I think to myself, “oh, Lord, here we go.” 

Me: I’ll be more than happy to help you with that but you need to make a payment first.

That set the customer into an angry screaming tirade. As he called me every cuss word in existence and even making up a few I’d never heard before, I was looking at his account and the notes attached. I kept going back to his name and that of the other account holder thinking to myself that it couldn’t be.

Finally the man said, “Well aren’t you going to say anything?”

Me: (faking a yawn just to let him know that what he had just said didn’t effect me) I was waiting on you to take a breath.

Well that set him off again. 

My manager, who had been listening to the call from the moment I pressed trace, emailed me “you have the company’s permission to hang up on him.”

I emailed back “I got this just give me a minute.”

I waited for the man to take a breath and said, “Sir May I ask a simple question?”

Customer: It better not be my fucking phone number. 

Me: No, sir, it’s not your phone number.

Customer: Well then what the fuck do you want to know you fucking bitch.

Me: I just wanted to know if you kissed my Aunt Ann with that mouth.

Customer: silence

I actually heard my manager snort when I said that.

Customer: How do you know my mother’s name?

Me: I am you cousin, TnWhiteWitch. You’re Uncle Thomas’ youngest daughter.

Customer: (quietly) Please don’t tell Uncle Tom.

Me: I’ll make you a deal. You pay your bill in full, I’ll turn your phone back on, and Daddy never needs to know.

Customer: What happens if I don’t.. 

Me: Well, I take a tape of this conversation home and play it for Dad. (Total lie but he didn’t need to know that)

Customer: ok, I’ll pay it but I still don’t agree that the charges are right.

Me: Once we get your phone back on you can dispute the charges with billing. I know Dad has been trying to reach you about Aunt Sarah. She’s not doing well.

Customer: How do I pay this?

Me: You can pay over the phone with either a check or credit card but I can’t take the payment seeing that I’m a relative. Hang on a sec and my manager will be over here and take over.

My manager was already standing behind me ready to take over. “Great de-escalation. Now go home and have a great vacation.”

"“I insist to talk to a woman, I don’t like talking to men.” -Male caller","Obligatory on mobile, etc. 

I worked as a call center agent for nearly a year, third party for a rather large bank. Now I have a lot of stories about the company and the members (we were not allowed to call them “clients” or “customers”) but this one sticks out to me. At the time I worked there, I was 19F and one of the best de-escalators when the members would get upset or angry. Even I didn’t know how to handle this one. 

It’s nearing the end of my shift, I’m kinda tired because I would work 10 hour shifts, and I’m starting to think about what to do when I get back to my house. I’ve got 30-ish minutes left before I go, and I get a call. It starts off normally enough, we get through the verification process and I help him reset his password. When we get to the end of the call is where it started to get weird. 

I follow my scripting generally, so I’m closing off with the “is there anything else I can help you with today?” And he says “I just wants to say I’m so glad that you’re a woman.”

Not really knowing how to respond to that, I told him I was glad he was pleased with the service he received today. Then he launched into this tirade about how men make him so mad, because they don’t know how to treat women right (with respect, care, etc) and he just can’t get along with them. He said he’d hang up every time he had to call X bank and a male rep answered the phone. 

I think he expected me to agree very verbally, but I fell back on the same training we received for if the members started talking politics: don’t contribute to the conversation, stay polite, stay neutral. Basically the call center equivalent of “smile and nod.” 

But wait, there’s more. While I’m not contributing much, he asks me “you don’t judge people right? You’re a good person?” I responded in the affirmative, and he said “Great. There’s something I’ve been needing to get off my chest.” And proceeds to tell me how he steals his mother’s/wife’s/sister’s undergarments (bras, panties, lingerie) and likes to put them on and masturbate. 

At this point I’m just kinda sitting there in stunned silence, while he continues to say things like “I bet you’re so pretty,” “it just makes me feel pretty too but I’m not like trans or anything,” and “it just feels so good to get this off my chest.” 

Not much I can really say, other than “happy to help” for fear of losing my job (they were very trigger-happy) and he just said how much he appreciated it and he hoped he got to talk to me again, if he ever saw me in person he’d “shower me with money and gifts” for being accepting, and kind.

We understand these are unusual circumstances.  We will absolutely work with customers to get them on a payment plan or change the service plan.  But they have to TALK TO US about it.  If we call and say ""there is a past due balance"" don't hang up.  Talk to us, tell us when you might be able to pay some of it, explain in general the situation (out of work, working less, etc) and we can come up with something to keep the service working while you pay a token amount until you are back at work or get a stimulus check or whatever.

Don't just blow off every attempt to contact you for 6 months and then lose your mind at me when the system finally shuts you off.  I know you need the internet for your kids' school, my kids are in the same school system.  You need to VPN for work?   Perhaps you should have answered my calls or responded to the emails or ... anything really. 

We have plenty of customers on payment plans or getting caught up from being on them right now.  She could have been one of them at any point if she had just communicated with us. But no, she's all over review sites &amp; community sites bad mouthing us for shutting her off ""in this time of crisis""

So she bitched at me for 5 minutes non-stop and I just muted the phone and let her flow.  When she ran out of steam I offered her a number of options for repayment and/or lower cost plans going forward.  But none of them were acceptable.  She wants at least half the balance waived and a lower cost plan with the same speeds/data limit she has now.  Because of the ""current times""

Yeah, that's not happening Karen &amp; I am the final arbitrator of that so .... she hung up.

I expect her husband will call back later (they have a history of good cop/bad cop with us) and be reasonable about it but those bitchy reviews are going to have to be amended as part of any deal.

It's been 6 months!! Who gives you 6 months with no communication before shutting you off? Why does that surprise people?",144,0,0
Don’t be rude,"So I work in medical billing in a call center. Part of my job is to pre-reg patients for their upcoming hospital services (like ct scan, mri for example). I called this woman this morning and she nearly bit my head off because she just did this crap for her appt tomorrow and she’s fully aware she has to pay the remaining any of her deductible tomorrow. She chewed me out because I told she technically doesn’t meet her deductible until services have been processed by insurance so until services are processed by insurance they will tell us she hasnt meet the deductible yet and that is the information we go by. 

Don’t be rude to us. We have the information and we are most likely a more knowledgeable when it comes to how insurance works than the average joe.

It’s illogical that drives me crazy....,"I can handle callers that genuinely need education. I get that our current education system in the US does not cover how interest works, etc. People that will listen and try to understand are a dream. They’re also like 2% of my calls! 

Today‘s gem was a woman who started out normal. She had one more question... “Why you charge me twice for same ting?” She was convinced that a payment she made in July paid for a charge not even made until 7/22.  I tried to explain it to her a few different ways, but she kept insisting we were charging her twice. I ordered another statement to be sent to her and asked her to review it and see for herself that she indeed only been charged once. 

Second woman today that blew my mind was a caller that came in with a question about why she was being charged interest. I brought up my transactions screen and immediately cringed because this woman makes many random payments throughout the billing cycle. It’s been my experience that this type of payer doesn’t keep up with the amounts of payments nor the dates she makes them, and so when the statement balance is not met by the due date by $0.37, she gets interest. This was the case today, and she was accrued the minimum interest charge, $0.50. Me, I’m going to try to get the interest waived rather than spend 5 minutes on a call trying to explain why. The funniest part was as I was trying to extricate meaning from the plate of spaghetti her charges and payments were, I broke the dead air by saying, “Just a moment.”  Her response was a gum-cracking “uh-huh” dripping in condescension and how right she was. Every time.  So if exercising assumed superiority over a credit card call center person is the high point of your day, then lady, you self-righteously uh-huh all day long. I’ll be done with you in approximately 1 minute, 15 seconds. Thanks for being the best part of (company) and have a GREAT day.",24,0,0
First call,"So this was some years ago. I took my first call center job I was excited! It was for a big cable company and The  trainer was a gaming nerd like me. Had a couple other trainees in the class that had the same interests. All and all started off great! 5 weeks paid training then to the phones. 

So right before we start week 6 and get on live calls we had to do some training calls and pass a test. Ok no biggie  I hit everything I was supposed to but after the lady that had tested me tells me maybe I should go take some speech classes in college cause I wasn’t going to “make it long” and she couldn’t believe they even hired me. Yea ok lady whatever shrugged it off and moved on. (I ended up being top in the call center and was there 4yrs) 


So my first call went a little like this 

Me: hello! Thank you for calling ———— my name is Krissy how can help you?

Caller: Krissy huh *heavy breathing* that’s hot 

Me: umm thank you how can I help you today? Or can we start with your name in phone number? 

Caller: *heavy breathing* I like your name *some noises* can you talk some more

Me: *starting to panic and looking around for a trainer to connect in start jumping up and down to get someone’s attention*

Caller: hey I need some help beautiful can you talk some more 

Me: sir can I get you name and telephone number so I can pull up your account (trainer is finally connecting in) 

Caller: oh yea you can get my name Krissy just keep talking it’s right there 

Me: excuse me sir........(I look at trainer her mouth is wide open  and she hits disconnect) 

Trainer: umm that guy was jacking off to your call go take a 15 min cig break you deserve one. 

Guys info did pop up on the computer apparently this is something he regularly did. 

Jokes were made by that trainer forever after till she left the company some years after me. apparently I was the first person to ever get a man pleasing himself on a first call. I used to get random condoms on my desk too. I’m assuming from other co workers that had seen or heard what happened.

Move my website to the top of Google!,"Long time lurker, first time poster, yadda yadda. 

Several years back while working for a local internet company in a large square shaped state, I got a good deal of angry, pissed off, irate, or otherwise absurd customers. Here is one that I was just reminded of that still makes me giggle. 

Cast: 

Me - Well, me
Internet Guy - IG

It is a non descript evening working in the call center where I was the only level two tech support rep on the floor. As such, I had the pleasure of taking supervisor requests, dealing with company accounts, as well as handle the few remaining web hosting customers our company had acquired through an acquisition. The last type of customer was rare, and their calls were usually grueling. The system we were using for their web hosting was draconian at best, and only a few people in our entire company were familiar with it. Lo and behold, this was the night that I had one fall in my lap. I pulled up the account from the phone number, saw it was a web hosting account, and braced for the impact. The following is an approximate transcript from that call.

Me: Thanks for calling (Shitty internet company), my name is SalsaSpade, how can I help you today?

IG: Hey there Ben, I need some help with my website. (Mind you, my name isn't Ben. Not even close. Customers routinely misheard us and really stuck to their guns with whatever name they thought they heard.)

Me: Not a problem, let's get in here and see what is going on..

(We verify the account details, blah blah blah)

Me: So what seems to be the problem?

IG: Well, my website isn't where it should be.

Me: (Incredibly confused, thinking the system was messed up and it wasn't being directed properly.) That's strange, when you go to the website does anything pull up? 

(I start digging into our system and, as far as I can tell, everything looks right.)

IG: When I search for it, it isn't where it should be! The website is fine, but it isn't where it should be. 

(clearly something is getting confused here. Given I wasn't well versed on this kind of issue, I assumed the issue was on our end. Eventually I just go to the website in question and it pops up fine.)

Me: I'm sorry sir, I don't see there being and issues with your website. I'm able to navigate to it without any issues... (Long pregnant pause)

IG: No, the website is fine but it isn't on Google where it needs to be.

Me: Wait. What?

IG: Yeah, look, if you google my website it is on the second page. I need you to move it to the top result.

(Another pause as my brain resets.)

Me: Sir, I-... Sir, that isn't something we control.

IG: Look. I've been working on the internet for a long time, I just need you to move my website to the top of Google. I think you can do that.

Me: Sir, that is controlled by search volume (I assumed), the results are generated by google, not by your host.

IG: Oh. Fine. So you're telling me that I need to call Google and have them move it. 

Me: I... Sir, that's not how it works. If I'm right, if more  people search for your site and select it, it will get moved up the search results. Or maybe if you changed your search criteria, that would make it higher.

IG: Look, thanks, I appreciate your time but I'm going to call Google to see if they can help me. Do you have a number for Google?

(The longest pause)

Me: No, sir. No I do not. 

IG: *sighs*that's fine, I'll Google it.

Me: Uh... Okay.

IG: *Hangs up*

"A decade worth of e-mails all gone, by the the simple non checking of a box. Life is fun, innit?","Hello all you glorious redditors here, I did post here a few years ago, but long since deleted my account and the tales with it - but alas I thought I would start posting stories of times gone by - now on to the story time!

**Background:**

At the age of 36 I live in my home town in Scotland where I was born and grew up, went to school and have my current job in retail for nearly four years now. This tale, amongst others that follow in this subreddit are from my job before this, where I worked in a callcentre for a national broadband, phone &amp; tv provider. I was in the business faults for broadband/phone line dealing with customers which I dealt with either on the phone or live chat over the 10 and a half years I was there before I was let go (that is a story for another time) - this story is from at some point whilst working there. It's worth keeping in mind that any names of customers, me and the company I did work for have been changed obviously to protect identities.

**Cast for this story:**

**Scotch:** Take a wild guess, hot stuff ;)

**EC:** E-Mail Customer

**CM:** Cool Manager (went through a couple whilst there, but at this point in time, CM was awesome)

**The Story:**

This story took place when Windows 7 was out for a few years and the customer decided to upgrade from their old XP machine to that, e-mails being one of the last thing he was looking to check - so this ir around 2011 ish.

*\*beep\**

**Scotch:** Welcome to &lt;telco's business support line&gt; my name is Scotch, who am I speaking to today and how can I help?

**EC:** Hi, my name is EC and all my e-mails have gone, I need your help! They are critical to my business you see.

**Scotch:** Sure, let me get some account details from you and lets see if we can get the problem fixed for you today EC.

*\*does account verification\**

**Scotch:** Thanks, ok, so the e-mails you lost, can you give me a bit more information about that? How do you normally check them? What setup do you have?

**EC:** I had a Windows XP machine, I used a program that came with it, I think it was Lookout Express? (Yes, he said it that way) and I used it in conjunction with \*your generic business e-mail address you guy's provide\* which I get my client orders from. I was using it for 10 years, it had all my e-mails in folders etc..

**Scotch:** Ahh, Outlook Express you mean, I know the program you are talking about, I can certainly help you with that, to see if we can recover or restore those e-mails for you! (Thinking it would be importing from a PST file or looking for a backup if he had one).

**EC:** Well, I have actually invested in a new computer, upgraded from XP to Windows 7 and my IT guy got it all setup for me, getting Office installed with the paid for Lookout Express on it (read: Outlook 2007) and when he put in my e-mail info, none of my e-mails downloaded, though this is the first chance over the weekend I have had to call you about it and when I go on-the=line (he said that too) I can't see them through your portal (read: Outlook Web Access).

*Thinking this was a bit strange, I talked him through out remote access software (go to assist) and got to his screen which he was happy to do.*

**Scotch:** That's me now on your screen, I am going to look at the settings on Outlook to see what I can find out for you.

*I checked the settings and all appear fine, but I did notice that the option for ""Leave a copy was not on the server"" was not checked.*

**Scotch:** Do you see this option here?

**EC:** Yes I do, why are you showing me this?

**Scotch:** Just want to let you see something, if close this program and send you an e-mail from out test account, will you logon to the portal, with me still connected and we both can see this e-mail?

**EC:** *\*a bit hesitant but not grasping what was to lie ahead\** Ok...

*He opens it, I send him a test e-mail and it appears in the inbox*

**Scotch:** As you can see the e-mail is there, can I get you to close the portal for me and open the e-mail program to get the e-mail for me?

**EC:** Sure \*does so\* - right I can see your e-mail there, but I already know the mail account is working.

**Scotch:** Now if we logon to the portal again, you will see that the e-mail is gone...

*The customer logs on and see's the e-mail is gone.*

**Scotch:** If you remember EC that option I showed you earlier? If that was selected in Outlook Express, not to leave a copy on line, and you have ben downloading your e-mails like this for over 10 years, we at \*shitty ISP\* won't have a copy for you.

**EC:** WHAT?!?!?!? What are you trying to tell me? That all my previous e-mails are gone, I NO LONGER HAVE THEM?

**Scotch:** Well, EC, think of it this way...when someone sends you an item via the post, it gets sent to the central hub, then to the dispatch hub then gets delivered to you, e-mails work in the same idea, that when a person sends you an e-mail, it gets sent from their services, like the central hub, which then forwards to our services, the dispatch hub, then to your mail client. Unlike the post, that little box I showed you requests us to keep a copy of the e-mail on our services for you, without it checked then we won't.

**EC:** SO.I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING??? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

**Scotch:** Well EC, I am sorry to say but there is nothing that we at \*shitty ISP\* can do for you, as that option was setup like that, the majority of configurations like that are the way they are. You mentioned that you had an IT guy, correct? Did he configure any backups for you or do you still have the old hard disk drive that you used? Your IT maybe able to pull it off that?

**EC:** I no longer have the hard drive as he took it out and destroyed it so no one could gain access to it!!!!

**Scotch:** Well, EC - I have checked that box for you, so we will, moving forward, keep a copy of your e-mails, but for the previous 10 years worth of stuff, we can't do anything about that.

**EC:** GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOW!!!!!! I AM NOT HAVING THIS - I AM ONE OF YOUR CALUED CUSTOMERS AND YOU CANT TREAT ME LIKE THIS! I WILL LOOSE MY BUSINESS BECAUSE OF YOU!!!

**Scotch:** Please calm down EC, I understand your frustration there, I really do, however my manager will advise of the same, nothing we can do and to speak to your IT incase there is a backup of it.

**EC:** DID YOU NOT HEAR ME? MANAGER!

**Scotch:** Please hold whilst I get my manager for you.

*I disconnected from my remote access, went over to CM who was in the next bay from me, advised him quickly of the situation and he asked me to transfer the call to him and update the case notes.*

**Scotch:** Ok, EC, I have spoke to my CM, his name is &lt;Cool Manager&gt; and I am now transferring you over to him.

*I updated the notes, saved them, then went on to take a few more calls, around 45 minutes later I took my break and found CM.*

**Scotch:** So, CM, what was the outcome of that call?

**CM:** \*Laughs a little\* He is going to speak to his IT guy for failing to backup anything - but he really was clueless on the whole e-mail thing. Not that I can blame him, as IT is not for everyone, but he should have had least a backup of the stuff or his IT guy made him aware of it!

**Scotch:** I hope that he and the IT guy does find a resolution...

**TLDR: Where's my flask of Whisky and serving of haggis? I need to go on an epic journey with my moose to track down some e-mails a customer lost, as he did not back them up before he upgraded. If I am not back my sunrise tomorrow, give all my worldly belongings to Pinocchio when he comes a real boy...**",43,0,0
It’s because of the HOLIDAY,"I work for a credit card company. Part of my job is issuing new cards to card holders that need them, whatever the reason. Usually, we can overnight cards or have them delivered the next following day. Since tomorrow is a holiday, most people are not getting their cards until Wednesday or Thursday. Explaining this has me banging my head against my desk every other call. The conversation usually goes as follows (this was taken from an actual conversation I had with a woman who was very upset lmao) 

Me:Thank you so much for verifying your information. Because of the holiday we are unable to do the next day delivery, so your card will arrive on [Wed or Thurs] I apologize for the inconvenience. 

Card member: can you overnight the card? I get cards overnighted all the time, why can’t you do it this time?

Me: it’s because of the holiday, the card delivery times are being delayed. 

Card member: but you guys are open on the holiday right? I pay [stupid amount in fees] a year for this card and I use it all the time! 

Me: Unfortunately most couriers do not run on holidays, Labor Day being one of them. You will have to wait until [day] to receive your card, no supervisor can override that for you.

That's not how this works ma'am.,"I just remembered a part of this call I had that was absolutely rediculous. 

I worked for a cell company in retention and ended up with a lot of pissed off customers. I had a lady that wanted a supervisor (I don't even remember what for now) but this was our exchange in me attempting to get her one

Me: yes ma'am I can get you a supervisor, can I put you on a brief hold while I get him? 

Lady: No, that's not ok! Do you work with other people? 

Me: ...... yes? 

Her: Are there people sitting next to you??

Me: ...... yes. 

Her: You need to tell the person next to you to get up and go grab the supervisor, it's terrible customer service to put someone on hold.

Me: Well ma'am this is a call center so everyone around me is taking calls and taking care of their own customers, so no, the people next to me can not get up to go get my supervisor for me. If you don't want to wait on hold for 2 minutes while I get my supervisor I can have him call you later, within the next 48 hours. 

She let me put her on hold after that 😂 

It blows me away that people think we're in some sort of laid back ""The Office"" type setting where no one's doing shit most of the time and can just get up and walk around to find a supervisor. Like,  you just complained at me about the 30 minute wait time do you really think every employee isn't tied to their desk taking back to back calls?",529,0,0

Me: Well... I wouldn’t be able to, but I can hold with you until we get somebody.

A very polite but awkward call to a funeral home,"I have worked at both call centers and answering services. This is from when I worked for an answering service. ( I hope thats allowed here)

So I worked overnights. We answered for various businesses but this story is from one of the funeral homes. 

Since I worked overnight, funeral calls were mostly death calls. Which is what it sounds like, someone (usually a nurse) calling to report a death. I got the info and passed it to the funeral director. It's pretty simple and straightforward.

Here is a transcript of a call I got around 6am one day. (I recorded it so this is exactly what was said)

Me: Thank you for calling \*blank\*&amp;\*blank\* funeral home. 

Caller: Good Morning!

\*I sit there waiting for him to continue because that isn't the type of greeting I expect for a funeral home\*

\*He doesn't say anything for a few seconds and I'm about to ask how I can help him, when he finally speaks\*

Caller: Ah your not the person I was upset with for 3 years. I'm sorry that I had to call so early. Goodbye.

Caller hangs up.

What...? 

I told my coworker who came in after me about it and we laughed. It's so bizarre, was this guy drunk? I mean probably, he did sound a bit drunk. 

But we wondered if we should let the funeral directors know that someone has it out for one of them. What did one of them do to make this man upset for 3 years?",43,0,0
"If you hate our hold muzak so much, why do you keep calling us to complain about it?","I've worked in various insurance call centers off and on for the last ten years. My current job is actually in handling technical support and handling escalated calls/contract enforcement calls. These include calls that are escalated because the caller is verbally abusive.

Me: Technical Support, this is Mentalgopher. What can I do for you?

CSR: My customer is demanding a refund for his time on the phone. He thinks he should be compensated for being forced to listen to our hold muzak.

Me: (Reviews the extensive notes on the customer's policy and notices multiple references to him accessing his policy online.) Is he aware that there's a chat option for contacting us rather than calling into us directly? 

CSR: He wants to speak with a supervisor about this, by the way. 

Me: So he's requesting to hear my lovely voice? I mean, I'm happy to talk to him, I guess.

CSR then patches customer through.

Customer: Are you a manager? 

Me: My name is Mentalgopher and I'm a supervisor. I understand you're requesting a refund?

Customer: I need to be compensated for my time on the phone. Your hold muzak is offensive to good taste. 

Me: Sir, we're an insurance company. We're not going to be refunding you because you're choosing to call us on the phone in spite of our hold muzak. Is there something that I can do to help you on your policy?

Customer: Well, that's racist of you. You're refusing to do it because I'm a minority.

Me: Duly noted. Was there anything else I could do to help you with your policy?

That time 911 called me,"I'm on mobile, don't hate me. Also, im sorry that this is a wall of text, if you know about the power grid you can skip a bit of it.

So during the winter of 2018 I worked for a power and natural gas company. It wasn't too bad, there was an  appointed utility commission requiring that employees work for at least 9 months before being allowed to work the gas emergency line, so they had motivation to treat you nice enough you'll stay around. I had been there maybe 6 or 7 months when the worst polar vortex storm the state had seen in ages hit. Where I lived it was frequently hitting -25, staying at -27 or below for over a week. One of the linemen even died from the storms knocking a pole on his head or something.

Even the waffle houses closed. Waffle houses are so reliable [Fema uses something called ""the waffle house index"" to rate disasters.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle_House_Index)

I was living close enough to work that they called me in a few times and all hours of the day over the weeks because the number of people who could arrive safely was small. It was fine, I had power the entire storm by some miracle and its not like there was anything else to do, the fat check would cover my own electric heating bill spike. 

At the beginning our queue could be over 500 people, I genuinely had nightmares about it for days after. Normal people go to school without pants, I check our queue and find out its doubled in the last minute and now has 4 digits. Even so by day 3 or 4 it was mostly just shouting that we need to reconnect their power before anyone else because of any number of reasons, none of which changed the reality that we couldn't do that.

The power grid is like a vascular system. If the end of the line isn't getting blood it isn't because the immediate juncture is stopped up. It could be 10 or 20x further away. So Karen in her cul de sac can scream all she wants about her dinner party being ruined, until we reconnect the main road back in town, that Karen and all the others relying on that station or transformer will be in the dark the same amount of time. This was compounded by weather and reconnection surges frying an entire second batch of equipment and causing a second wave of outages. 

As a result the several state area this company covered had some patches that were out of power for over a week. Usually the out of the way rural patches get connected last because they have the smallest population impact. Unfortunately 911 relay stations are also usually out of the way a little bit.

So here I am, day 3 or 4 of working so much I considered using the office gym showers so I can just stay at the office and not drive in the scary blizzard, and I get the most memorable call I've ever had. 

Me: thank you for calling ~~power company~~, my name is EisConfused, how may I help you today?

Caller: so im not sure you can help, please let me know if you need to get a supervisor. My name is ~~David or something~~ and I am with ~~major cellular company~~. We donate facilities to be used as 911 relays and switch boards, and the 911 branch in ~~Minnesota town~~ has a problem. See we have generators and fuel, but only enough for 86 hours. We are currently at about 76 hours without power. We have a fuel delivery being made on an emergency basis tomorrow, after they will have been out of power for about 90 hours. With this weather we need to remain active so our last ditch hope was to contact you guys and see what can be done.

Me, staring blankly at the address search screen trying to process this: well... let me put you on hold for just a second, I want to see if we have a protocol for..this..can I get the address of your building? 

Caller: oh yeah absolutely, ask around, anything that may help. Our address is ~~very Minnesota road in very mid west town~~

At this point I just mute and ask the girl next to me what the hell I do. The supervisors were beyond busy. Sometimes even taking calls themselves, but She had worked there for 5 or 6 years and just gave me a blank stare for a moment going ""huh, thats new, call dispatch I guess. It is an emergency. Several actually."" I hop on the line, check to make sure an order to investigate the outage is already there, check in with the caller and get his callback line, all that, then call dispatch. 

Dispatch: ~~name~~ with elec dispatch, whats the issue?

Me: so I know we don't prioritize who gets reconnected b-

Dispatch: ya damn right we don't!

Me: yes I understand that, but I have a fellow from 911 on my line. He says they've exhausted their options for keeping the lights on themselves. They won't get fuel for the generator until they've been offline for several hours. That town was hit some of the worst, the last thing they need is to not be able to contact emergency services. 

Dispatch: *long pause* okay I need to put you on hold.

*A bunch of shouting into different rooms because he didn't put me on hold or even mute me*

Dispatch boss: this is dispatch boss, I hear you've got 911 on your line?

We go back and forth, I bring the cell rep into the call and hop around in the system getting our protocol stuff done, and letting my team lead know what's going on. I never heard about the issue again, so I have to assume it worked out. Honestly I think that dispatch actually giving a hoot was more surreal than being called by 911. Those guys always sound like every request you make is like squeezing lemon juice in their eyes.

I wasn't there that long and while this story is the best for telling at parties its not the only memorable incident. Let me know if I should cover that time someone threatened to kill themselves on my line before I was even out of training, or the guy who wanted us to come check his wall outlets because the thought his landlord was using them to dispense nanites into his brain that made him fall asleep and let robbers steal from him.",930,1,0
When you go from annoyed to impressed,"I had someone call in basically because of a paperwork snafu. Once I figured out what happened I had it solved in like 2 minutes..but this caller just wouldn't give me space to talk. It took about 30 minutes to explain what happened and that there was nothing to worry about because the problem had been solved. This was primarily due to the caller interrupting me.

What happened next was pretty glorious...

This caller managed to somehow continue talking, basically nonstop, for more than an hour. I think it was at the 40ish minute mark that I went from annoyed to just..curious, about how long they'd last, and then impressed as they kept going. They kept finding ways to segway wildly from one topic to another - think printers to the insolvency of social security...and like, every now and then, they'd realize that they no longer needed to talk to me and start saying goodbye..only to keep going! I initially kept a little list of what they'd rambled about, but I eventually gave up as it was getting too long. Keep in mind, by the hour mark, I was basically just saying ""uh huh"" and ""yep"" kind of stuff, so their rambling was entirely self-inspired.

I think they must've made to end the call 6 or 7 times before finally doing it. By the end, we'd been talking for about an hour and 40 minutes. I was incredibly entertained and also glad that management don't care about average call time. I basically got paid to listen to someone ramble about completely random topics for an hour and a half. And then once they'd finally wore themselves out...I sent an email to workforce that I was going on the break I'd missed.

That call broke my call time record. I am so hyped for the next recordbreaker!",114,0,0
"Um, what do I do here?","Back in the late 1990's, when I thought I was done with university), I was applying for all sorts of jobs. One of them, was in a call centre, Now I wasn't very experienced phones at this point, a bit shy and didn't like ringing people, but I was fine if people were ringing me...so the job I applied for was specifically for an inbound call centre. This particular call centre had contracts with multiple businesses, but wanted someone that was studying marketing for a particular client...so I applied.

The interview was a group interview, and lasted the entire morning. Those that they were interested in, were asked to stick around after lunch, for some practical experience. I was one of the ones that stuck around. So after lunch, they place us all individually in these inhumane cubicles...sometimes I don't understand how you call centre workers can stand working in such small confined spaces all day.  So anyway, I get placed in my cubicle...and we are told what our activity is going to be. For the next hour, we would be cold calling people, asking them if they would like to do a survey for a medical related non-profit organisation (lets call it Australian Red Noughts). We were given the survey questions we were to ask. We had a worksheet in front of us where we had to write down the phone number, and the answers to the survey questions. We were also given a list of phone numbers for us to call, and supervisors would be listening in to see how we were going.

Now the first problem we all had, is that none of us had ever worked in a call centre before. With the exception of one or two, we were all in our late teens/early 20s. So we were given a very brief rundown on how we were supposed to talk on the phone, not to get angry with the person on the other end of the call, and a couple of cheat sheets on what to say if a person answered a particular question a particular way. If we get stuck, we were to put our hand up, and a supervisor would come over. Seems pretty straight forward. Now, maybe they were testing me or something, but I got possibly the worst batch of numbers, and the worst cubicle.

For starters, while everyone else got a handset, my cubicle was without one. The supervisors had to go running around finding one, and when they couldn't find one, I had to be given a headset...so there goes an extra couple of minutes showing me how to use the headset. Then that headset didnt want to work properly, so they had to get me another headset. My first call...no answer. My second call...no answer. I got to about the eighth number before there was an answer...a bloody answering machine. We were not given instruction on what to do if we got an answering machine. Another four no answers. Then I got someone who answered...they politely said I am not interested in buying anything, and promptly hung up. Two more no answers, and then did a call that was answered by a 5 year old kid. Again...no instruction on what the hell to do in this situation. Supervisor came over and said to just hang up. Three or four more calls that went unanswered...and then my time was up. Total surveys done...ZERO.

Feedback two weeks later when I am told I didn't get the job...I didn't get enough people to answer the survey to gauge my ability. When I said that only two people actually answer the phone, they told me that everyone else had at least 10...so why didn't I have that many? Looking back, I am glad I didn't get the job.",27,0,0
You're Not Doing Enough,"  

All the usual BS, ran Grammarly, I don’t do TL;DR, read the tale, and enjoy.

You’re damned if you do, you’re damned if you don’t. Other than my catchphrase of “stupidity keeps me employed,” those are words to live by in my life sentence (though hoping parole soon) in call centers. Now for anyone who hasn’t read any of my previous Rants/tales, I work in a retail call center doing customer service. One of the biggest things that we see is customers who forget something at the register. It’s usually small items that are easily missed like batteries or items that are set to the side like TP of large items from our GM areas; however, I see days when I get people who leave behind the only bag that they paid for, I wish I were lying with this, but I had two of those yesterday. 

This tale is not about those idiots; no, this is a special type of demon (and not the fun type that I hang out with on weekends), not this was a harpy from the far reaches of hell. Backstory, she called for an item behind; it was a small item, a drill bit, I think. 

M: Me

HFH: Harpy from Hell

M: (Greeting) How may I help you?

HFH: Yes, I have to travel a great distance to get to your store. (Fuck, I already know this call is going south), and I came in today and made a purchase, and when I got home, I unloaded my bags, and my drill bit was not here. 

\*Yes, she gave me the play-by-play, I even left about how she pulled each bag from her truck with extreme care. 

M: I am sorry that happened to you. I will give you all the information you need to take care of that. 

HFH: Whatever. That was the main that I needed. I mean, how do you let me not take the main item that I came in for?

\*I ignored the asinine nature of that statement.

M: I understand, those things do happen, and we have ways of getting that resolved. What you will need to do is circle the item on the receipt, bring the receipt to service, and get a refund or replacement for the item, depending on availability.

\*I swear I could hear the steam whistle that came from her ears. I knew that a storm of fire and brimstone was about to rain upon my poor left ear. 

HFH: THAT’S IT? DO YOU THINK THAT I CAN RUN BACK UP THERE LA-DI-DAH? (There was some incoherent rambling I tuned out.)

M: I am sorry for the inconvenience, we understand that you may not be able to come in tonight, so we do allow ten days to go in and…

\*I was about to tell her that if she needed more time, we could accommodate her, but oh hell no. 

\*Hellfire hurricane in my left ear. 

HFH: I WOULD EXPECT YOU DO MORE FOR ME! (WTF lady, we are going to give you replacements or a fucking refund, what do you expect, a diamond ring?) You know I stopped shopping &lt;Store&gt; and decided that I would give them a try, and you do this to me? I would expect your company to do more for their customers, and when I have an issue, you’re doing nothing for me. 

M: We are willing to… &lt;Click&gt;

I had to take a minute after this one. I can not believe that someone would feel that we are not doing enough for them when we are willing to replace or refund the fucking item. We are very flexible with timeframes, especially with The Zombie Apocalypse of Stupidity happening. If she were really expecting to get something more for her stupidity, I would have been happy to pass her off to one of our jackass store managers who lost fucks to give about six months ago. I don’t get yelling at me because she left something behind that we are will to replace for her. I think with this call; I have found the level below the bottom of the barrel.

Hellllloooooooooo???,"I work at a mortgage call center, and I hear this phrase all the time, It’s mostly with customers of non American descent ( not trying to be racist) so I usually have a very hard time understanding accents and usually because of this my brain needs a second to process.

Might become a human punch bag at this rate,"I work for my local council (UK) call centre on nights. Now I love the job, it’s 3 nights a week, 13 hour shifts, plenty of opportunity for overtime to make extra money and I am working from home. Absolute dream. We deal with a lot of stuff on a night from emergency repairs for council housing to social services. It can get super busy and be a little stressful. But this call had me absolutely done with entitled council tenants. 

We try to keep the calls on a night short. Gather the information we need and get the person off the call, as we never know what the next call could be (for example a police call for a child in danger etc). 

Guy comes through at something past 9pm (we work from 7pm to 8am). The moment I answer, it’s an illegible older gent going on about some leak in his house f’ing and shitting all the way through, on about how he pays super expensive rent for his council house, pays his council tax on time and all that. I also hear the words “the engineer is here, about f’ing time”. Now when we do a night time call out, maximum wait time for an engineer is 2 hours. On a normal day you could be waiting from 8am to 6pm for an engineer. 

Turns out this guys toilet was leaking. I’m remaining polite through and through, trying to understand the reason for his call. As the call goes on he keeps switching between swearing at me and then swearing at the engineer. By the 15 minute mark of this call I’m pretty sick of his shit. With a bit of aggression, just to sound more stern, I ask this guy for his address details, and ask him to stop shouting at the engineer, as the engineer (and me) have a right to work in a safe environment and we don’t appreciate the language he is using. He’s still talking over me. Engineer is going at him to tell him to calm down, I’m going “sir, sir, sir??” like an absolute dickhead trying to get his attention and he’s still going on. Engineer is saying that shouting at me on the phone won’t do anything to help (thank you random engineer!). 

By some miracle I manage to get his details, he starts talking to me about how this is the 4th time in 2 months that his toilet has flooded his house and how every time he has human waste everywhere. He’s off again swearing and shouting. At this point both me and the engineer are telling this dude to stop and calm down. He’s going at it “would you be calm if this was your house blah blah blah”. Now don’t get me wrong, I get it, it’s frustrating but taking it out on the poor guy who’s come to sweep up the shit that’s flowing through your bathroom and taking it out on call centre staff who can’t do shit either is beyond me. 

I honestly so many times feel like a human punch bag for people to use over the phone. I love my job, but being treated like shit can be a real downer sometimes. Hardest yet is taking the next call and not showing how much the previous one affected you.",24,0,0
Your name is what?,"Sorry for formatting/spelling, I’m posting on mobile. I work for a US call center as a tier 2 support/supervisor. The company I answer for is a large retailer in the US only. My company is an outsourcing company and both my team and the front line agents (FLA) are employees of this outsourcing company.  Although the FLAs are overseas my team is US based. 

My team (tier 2 support) takes calls in transfer from FLAs because customers want to either speak with an American, or a supervisor, or (lately) the agent just doesn’t know what to do. Just to be clear the FLAs are not supposed to be sending callers over to us if they don’t know the answer. They have their own local support they’re supposed to reach out to. But, that’s a different topic for another time. 

When the customer calls in they assume that anyone who has an accent is not in the US and those who speak with “no accent” are American which automatically makes us “outsourced” vs “employee.” Customers have no idea they never talk to an actual employee for the company unless they are in the retail store itself.

Anyway, this post is about names. And the absurdity of the FLAs name choice. To explain, 90% of the FLAs are recommended to pick a name that sounds more “English.” Because their native name isn’t easy to pronounce or spell in English. So someone named “Ligaya” may choose a different name (not sure if anyone is named that, it’s just a random name I looked up). 

I don’t usually have a problem with taking calls from the FLA’s. A lot of times they can’t control the stupidity of the customer. What I hate is when the FLAs say: “hi  I have a customer who wants to talk to you regarding... ( random issue).” So I say: “OK can I have your name?” FLA: “Yeah I’m Jason.” Me: “okay thanks.” 
Seems normal enough, so I pull up the account and information and find out that “Jason” is actually spelled “Jaysoine.” Or a name pronounced Mary is spelled Mearriy. Even those who pick a longer name are spelling them weird. Like pronouncing Anastasia but spelling Enistashia. 

I know the FLAs are picking a different name, because the trainer for all of FLAs came into town to train my team and told us that the FLAs get to pick their name when they start with the company. He said a lot of them don’t even know English until they start with the company and they’re trained in both their native language and English. It’s very annoying because they could spell their name the “English version” or even close to the “English version” but they’re knowingly choosing to spell it in a very convoluted way. Like what’s the point of changing your name if you are not going to make it an easy name to spell when you hear it. 

This is especially annoying for customers who are transferred through who say yeah I just talked to “Jerry.” The FLA told you their name was Jerry. But when you look at the case the FLAs name isn’t spelled “Jerry” it’s spelled Gherriy. 

After complaining multiple times of not understanding the agents name/spelling eventually leadership said to get their employee ID number so there’s no miscommunication. So now I don’t even bother writing the FLAs name in my notes until I pull the case up and can put the actual spelling on my notes. 

Sorry for the long post, just a bit of a rant after talking to too many people that had weird name spellings/pronunciations. I didn’t even realize how long it was until I finished typing! Haha!",26,0,0

Outsourcing stories?,"So if you work in a call centre for a company then you will likely have had encounters with the outsource workers. Now I 'm not saying all of them are bad but you do get the groups that don't get company standard training nor are they regulated like the rest of the company.

I had one warm transfer a customer to me and I started talking to the customer under the assumption they had left. The customer started telling me they weren't happy with how they had been treated by them so said I would record feedback and pass it on only to have the outsource person then choose to pipe up and state that they were still there if I needed anything! 

I just turned round and said no they were not needed and could leave before suspending them from the call so they couldn't hear anything else. I apologised so much to that customer who thankfully whilst annoyed with the outsource wasn't too bad of a customer.

&amp;#x200B;

One that just happened:

I had outsource call through with a letting agents disputing the bill so asked them to go back and check the dates and if they had readings, they just came back confirming dates. I had to ask them again to go back for readings which they then decided to just cold transfer the customer to me without warning either way.

&amp;#x200B;

I sorted out the customer and then checked the notes to find they put ""Transferred the call as ppm kept sending me back and fourth"". I had asked them for two things which they only got one which was their fault it resulted in them having to go back again. 

There was also a lot of background noise on their end which they said was prizes being given out for performance and they were waiting on their turn so wouldn't surprise me if that was why they did it.

Does this make sense?,"If someone was promoted to fulltime QA and have now been assigned agents to do auditing (listening to/grading calls and calling agents that failed the audit to review their mistakes) should they still be in the queue receiving calls that are essentially back to back making it virtually impossible to audit calls? Btw management is aware that said auditor is still in the queue receiving calls.

***Update***
So even tho said auditor is in a helpline queue they are stil receiving back to back calls from agents throughout the day. It takes them nearly 2 hours to grade 1 call as they can only listen to the call recording during the wrap up time in between the live calls they are receiving. They have reached out to management twice about the issue but have not been advised whether or not this is the way the job is supposed to be, it is a temporary measure or if this is in error.",186,0,0
"""I'll tell my son you wish him a happy birthday, you useless piece of...""","I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

Miserable day, been drinking since my shift ended.

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C: Customer

So I had this customer who has been trying to book a rental since yesterday. Apparently she was trying to pay in advance (because if you pay in advance you get a better rate when compared to the rate if you pay at the counter), but was told to call us today because the system wouldn't accept her credit card (would constantly remind me that it was our fault, not hers). Apparently she had booked this reservation to visit her son, it was his birthday.

C: I swear, I'm not a bitch... but this whole situation has been handled so poorly...

*I couldn't help but roll my eyes*

C: One agent told me that he had booked me a reservation earlier, but I talked to your agent and she was unable to find it.

I asked her for the original pick up location, date of pick up and her last name. After she provided me that information, I was able to find her reservation.

H: I found the reservation. It has unlimited miles, and with taxes and fees included it would be an estimated 127 USD.

C: No, but if I pay in advance it would be 110 USD.

I found the previous agents' attempts to create the reservation paid in advance, but, just like the customer told me, they were unsuccessful.

H: I do see that you tried to pay with a Credit Card that ends with 1234, by any chance, is the billing address correct?

C: Yes.

H: Do you have another billing address?

C: Yes.

H: It is possible that your Credit Card still has the old billing address. That could explain why they were unable to process your reservations.

Of course she would immediately blame us for this mistake, as no agent had bothered to ask her for the address. Whatever, I offered to make a Prepaid reservation for her and be over with this... then suddenly...

H: ... and are you paying with a major credit card or a debit card?

C: Debit card.

*I shat a brick*

H: By any chance... do you have a major credit card?

C: No.

H: Are you flying into that airport?

C: No, I live here.

I explain her that, unless she has a flight itinerary, the airport wouldn't accept her debit card.

C: WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY?

I mean, honestly, I just received the call, what the hell am I supposed to tell her?

H: Maybe there's another rental car company at the airport that can accept your debit card.

C: All of them would be closed by now!

After constantly apologizing to her and telling her that there was no way the airport would accept her debit card...

C: Well, I guess I'll have to call my son. I'll tell him you wish him a happy fucking birthday...

H: Ummm...

C: You useless piece of shit...

H: NO U!

C: You...

This call left a bitter taste in my mouth. While I do feel for her, at the same time she made the whole call unpleasant, demanding that we honored the Prepay rate and constantly blaming us for everything that was going on. I'll be the first to admit it sucks, you're given a rate and suddenly you're unable to get it and forced to go with something higher (pay at the counter for an additional 16 USD). I understand that sense of entitlement for the rate that you were quoted, but system limitations won't allow us to proceed, it's not like that agent at the phone wants to ruin your life. Like I tell my customers, if you don't like the rate, feel free to shop around, if you don't find anything better, we'll be here for you.

Suggesting ways callers can help themselves apparently means we don't want to help you,"My company has been dealing with high call volume thanks to Covid-19 related issues. And also due to Covid-19, I've been assisting callers with bank disputes. We've been trying to promote self-assistance on our website to cut down on call volume. I'll often ask callers if they would like information on how they can setup an online account if they don't have one or links to where they can find the information I advised on our website for future reference. Callers will either say yes or no. 

I was telling a Karen earlier we could set up account monitoring if she'd like if she verified her contact info. She says sure...and then I also ask if she would like me to send her information on how she can set up a dispute on our website in the future. For some reason, Karen's tone suddenly escalates. 

Karen: Excuse me?? This is ridiculous, you're telling me you can't help me, forget about it \*hangs up\* 

The mere suggestion of self-servicing on our website rather than calling and tying up our lines for things that take a few minutes to do yourself is...ridiculous. 

I asked several subsequent callers the same exact question and they politely declined or said they would love if I would do that for them. 

Another caller, Kevin, complains about holding for 20 minutes...to which he asks a question that took me three seconds to answer. He could've found this out on our website but says he would rather call us if he needed help even though he just complained about our hold times. 

And then we have Carol, who became aggravated at the idea of contacting a merchant first before disputing a charge. 

Carol: SO YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HELP ME?????

Me: Attempting to work with a merchant directly first is recommended

Carol: NO, I'M NOT CONTACTING THEM, I CONTACTED YOU. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT FOR ME. WHY DO I HAVE TO DO YOUR JOB?

Carol also has hundreds of disputes on her account because she refuses to even attempt to contact merchants for her various issues. I foresee multiple merchants banning her doing business with them.",30,0,0
Last call Karen.,"It's 2 minutes to the end of your shift and a call comes in.

Karen: screech curse blame screech...
30 minutes pass. This exchange repeats itself a FEW times.

Karen: Well how do I even fix it!! What do we do now! What are my next steps! Fuck this company, we're moving all our business over the most common error you see in your system that is easily fixed during regular business hours. Waaaaaaaaahhhhhhh incoherent screeeeeeeeeee

"The office is closed. Closed is the office. The office is the opposite of open. The office? It’s closed. The state of the office is closed. The office is not open, it is closed.","Just spoke with a vendor who wants to pick up a check from our local office. I explained that all offices in out jurisdiction are closed due to this COVID-19 pandemic. They have been closed since mid-March. They can’t print checks there. Because they’re closed.

You may have guessed from the title that I tried many different ways to impress upon him that the office was closed. He said, “I can go to X business and they will print a check for me, why can’t you?”

Because it’s not an open office, it’s a closed office! It is the very definition of a closed office!!! It is an ex-open office!

We can and will print a check from head office. However we are not able to send it by courier, it will arrive by regular mail. That was also an answer he wouldn’t accept.

Edited to add: we can't do electronic bank transfers for smaller businesses yet. 
He wanted to be paid ASAP because he has upcoming travel plans and didn't want to wait for the postal service to deliver the check.  
He wanted to escalate, so my supervisor was brought in. We both pored over our methods of payment, and reached out to other teams including accounts payable, to see if there was something we missed, or if someone had found a way around our current restrictions. One does not simply shut down the payment processing center of an international company, to snatch one check out, and send it by courier, unfortunately. 
I'm aware that small businesses are suffering during the pandemic. Instead of just shoving this off onto the coworker who didn't pay the invoice when she got it on Monday, I expressed empathy and tried to solve the problem, while being yelled at about the other companies who do print checks locally.

“You better cut me a check for making me do all the leg work!”,"First time posting here.

I work in auto/cycle insurance. I don’t know if there was a full moon or something last week, but at least once a day I got someone screaming at me for something. 

I get an older man on the phone for his motorcycle policy he recently started with us about a month back. I can already see in the notes that he’s at least spoken to a sup once before. I already can feel where this call is going and I automatically mentally prepare myself for what’s to come.

Me: *does greeting and verifies privacy info* How can I help today, sir?

Caller: I got a letter here saying you guys took off my HOG discount! Why?!

M: Well, sir, to keep that discount we needed a copy or photo of your membership ID card to be email/faxed in. I can forward you our contact info along with your policy number so we can get this taken care of immediately.

C: I can’t email or fax it in.

M: Do you have any friends/family who can assist you sending it in?

C: No. Can I give you my ID# and their number and you can call them so you can give me the discount?

M: I apologize but I cannot do that. We are an incoming call center and do not do call outs. Even if I could that would not be considered acceptable proof per our company guidelines.

At this point we go in circles for a few minutes with him insisting I call them because that’s the only way and me repeating to him that it’s not gonna be sufficient proof.

C: This is *ridiculous*!! I just spent $2k on my policy for the year and you guys are making me do *more* work? I shouldn’t have to prove to you that I’m a member and now you’re making me pay *more* money and taking away my discount. You better be sending me a check for all the legwork I’m doing to keep my policy going!! This isn’t my job to do it’s yours! Now tell me why you can’t call them and have them verify that I’m a member?!

M: *takes a moment to gather myself*

C: THAT’S RIGHT YOU CAN’T BECAUSE THIS IS BULLSH*T! *click*

TL;DR: caller was angry that a discount was taken off and I wouldn’t do what he wanted to put it back on since it wasn’t acceptable proof. Demanded we send him a check for doing my job.",32,0,0
Customer never wants to speak to me again.,"One of my greatest hits from my call center gig at a US auto finance company.

\*Account verification and greeting\*

Customer: I'm not understanding why you people called me.

Me: We're calling about your vehicle ma'am. We're showing that your account is past-

\*customer interrupts me\*

NO, NO, NO, I am not past due.

Me: Well, did you make a payment towards you're account recently?

Customer: I mailed a check a few weeks ago, so I KNOW I am not past due.

Me: Was the check cashed on your bank statement?

\*Customer sighs\* Well, I am never past due so your records must be wrong.

Me: Ma'am I'm asking you whether you show a payment cleared your bank account?

Customer: If you would stop interrupting me, I would tell you when I mailed it.

\-\_-

Me: Okay, ma'am when did you mail the payment?

Customer: I mailed it last week.

Me: Ma'am, you advised me you mailed it a few weeks ago? I just need to clarify the time period or date you mailed it.

Customer: You're NOT listening. I said I THOUGHT I mailed the payment a few weeks ago.

\-\_-

Me: Well, if the payment cleared your bank account, we will need proof of cleared funds.

Customer: Why should I have to do your job for YOU?

Me: Without proof we cannot apply the payment to your account.

Customer: Is there a manager I can speak with? It's not my fault. MY check is probably sitting on someone's desk.

Me: Ma'am, it's not a human being that processes the checks, we use an automated system to process all of our checks.

Customer: Don't lie to me. You people made a mistake so you can fix it!

Me: We have millions of customers and process potentially hundreds if not thousands of payments per day. So, advise me ma'am, how do you think a human being could do that in a single day?

Customer: I don't appreciate your attitude.

Me: Well, without proof of cleared funds, your account will continue to be past due and we are obligated to report to the credit bureaus every 30, 60 and 90 days.

Customer: I'm done with you people. I'm going to (Competitor's company) and I never want to speak to YOU ever again!

A long time ago...,"I am unable to remember most of this situation but the main points I can.

Many years ago, I was on LiveChat when the first things out of Karen’s keyboard was how long the wait was. I honestly can’t remember how long it was, but she ranted for at least 5 minutes.

At the time, including her, I had 3 chats going at once. For those that might not know, this particular LiveChat software had these separated chats in 3 tabs and the tab would change colour if someone finished writing something to me, so I just worried about answering questions in the changing colour tabs ignoring everything else.

After however long it was, I had sorted out Karen’s issue, and was just working on the other two before I went to my next break.

Eventually after 14 minutes, I had finished the other two chats, then realised that I had not heard from Karen in that time. I asked her if there was anything else I can help with. She snarkily replied with something like ‘Now you know what it’s like to be waiting for a long time.’

I did not have the heart to mention that I had actually forgotten about her.",377,0,0
First day at a call center,"...and it was a raging dumpster fire for myself. First call, I panicked and hung up. There wasn't anyone talking immediately, and my brain was somehow struggling to form words and just said nope. Second call was going okay, until the warm transfer. I hit the wrong button too quickly, then tried to leave the conference as quietly as possible, only to realize too late I was shoved into another call. And then ANOTHER call after I tried to log out.

I'm still in training, and they extended our training another day. Everyone sympathized with me, but I feel like such an idiot. I've never done calls before and only worked retail.

Billing Inquiries,"The majority of my calls are centered around billing questions and explaining charges. Me (#2) and C (customer).

C: What does -2.34 mean on my bill this month?

2: Looks like you made a payment of $205. It paid last month's bill and the extra was credited to your August bill. Your remaining total was a credit of $2.34.

C: I don't understand. I paid extra to cover September and October. 

2: Sir, the extra you paid only covered July and August bill. 

C: That's not true. Verizon is stealing from me.

2: (Knowing this call is just going to keep going around in circles at this point) Well your not past due, the bill has been paid, and your next summary is $88. 

C: How come the extra I paid doesn't cover September and October?

2: (Literally wondering if he's just an early morning drinker or actually stupid) Sir, as I've stated the $205 paid for July and August bill. Not to mention that extra $100 wouldn't even cover September and October if the bill summary is $88 for both months, that is $176. If you wish to make another payment in that amount, it will credit to September and October.

C: I've already paid extra! You're scamming me!

2: Well your due date is 10/17 for the next bill, do you have anymore questions?

C: I want a supervisor!

2: Sure I can put in a proposal for pending approval now or we can schedule a call back. (Knowing damn good and well that my supervisors are garbage and will never take a call, plus we don't do scheduled call backs with supervisors.)

"From Hopeful to Hopeless, and Hopeful Again!","A couple of months ago I was hired at a call center to help get leads for law firms. I thought that this would be a good place to get legal experience, but it turned out to be one of the most difficult jobs I've had so far. I had to make outbound calls to people who had made calls/submissions for talcum powder/Zantac or whatever harmful medication there is out there. At first, the job was easy and simple, but within a period of 4 months, I went from hopeful to hopeless.

First, the clients that I would speak would be irritable and would sometimes break down on me as they would recall the pain that was caused to them by evil pharmaceutical companies. Second, the management would micromanage every move that you would make, and the scripts were riddled with errors and I had to consult my supervisor because any mistake made is liable for a write-up. Even though I was college-educated, management treated me like an idiot. My first write-up was because I accidentally forgot to switch over a script and accidentally used the wrong voicemail script for a call. Third, the pay was low, and I was only given 12 bucks an hour to speak with belligerent and emotionally demanding clients.

The emotional toll that this job had on me can not be understated. I started suffering from a constant wave of panic attacks every day. What finally pushed me the edge to quit was two dreams this weekend. The first dream was pleasant, I was in Law School, and was satisfied being in lecture and studying the material. The second dream was unpleasant, I was dreaming that I was doing an intake with a broken script, and an irate customer. That dream was the final straw and decided that I could no longer do this job any longer.

I spoke with my family and I asked if I could count on their support because this job was destroying me mentally. They said they would support me, and I quit this Monday with an immediate notice. I broke down that morning because I realized that there are many working-class Americans who don't have the social support to quit their jobs, and I was the lucky one who could escape. People have to do this kind of job because it's either this or the streets.

Now I'm focusing on my volunteer work in politics, and I'm thinking about taking advantage of this bad economic situation to study for the LSAT and knock it out of the park next year so I could get a great scholarship.",17,0,0

I can't believe your bank killed me!,"This was a few years ago when I was in collections taking supervisor calls for a major bank (credit cards.) Cast here is Me (duh), FLR (front line rep), CM (card member).  

Me: hello rep this is Annadownya how can I help you?

FLR: (she's from India, only important because it explains the misunderstanding) Mr CM asked for a supervisor because i told him he was deceased.

( I'm confused.  I'm frantically scanning the acct and I don't see anything saying the acct holder's dead. )

Me: I'm confused where do you see that he died? 

FLR: it says it's an estate account.

(Still not seeing anything in memos then I get it.  Our estate accts at the time  would say ""NAME, EST OF"" for estate of.  This guy had an ESQ after his name for esquire because he was an attorney.  I explained this to the poor rep who was very ""oh I'm so sorry"")

Me: So you told an attorney he's dead and now he wants a supervisor? Send him over!

(She gets the customer over who is understandably livid because he thinks we reported him dead to the credit bureaus which is hard to fix)

CM: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR BANK KILLED ME!! I'm not normally that kind of a lawyer but I'm going to sue you so hard you won't remember what money looks like!

(I let him vent a bit and at the first breath butt in to quickly explain the mistake. He's not dead. Our rep confused ESQ with EST.  I explained it to the rep, im sorry. You're good!  He finally laughed about it.)

How could you ask that question?,"Writing this from mobile, sorry for formatting issues. 
I work for a large online/retail store. Part of the products sold is pet medication. My calls are the tier 2 escalated calls that the front line agents couldn’t resolve. 

Anyway, onto my story. Customer placed an order for a pet pain medication. She was told it would be 5 business days shipping. She placed EOD on a Wednesday and called every day to inquire on shipping. She expected it to deliver by Monday. Other agents advised the status as it was being processed through each department. Which fooled her into thinking it would be shipped faster. 

As a sidebar: When it comes to a complex order like a medication it is so varied. Honestly I always tell people they get 5-7 business days for order processing and another 5-7 days once shipped to arrive. It can process faster but it’s based on the vet approval of the rx, pharmacy completing and processing the order, warehouse packing, and then picked up by the shipping company. In an ideal world you would get the order about 10 business days after placing it. 

Back to my story. She called at least 6+ separate times before getting me, the 7th. The customer stated that someone along the way told her she would get the package within 5 days (wrong) of placing it and she only has one day of meds left. Her puppy was hurting and it made her upset. Now she is crying on the phone. She wanted to know what I wanted her to do. She asked me if I just wanted to “have me kill myself rather than watch my baby suffer.” 

This is the first for me, I’ve been working in call centers for 10+ years. I’ve been called every name in the book... and then some. I’ve been proposed to, asked what shoes I was wearing, if I had as sexy. Voice as it sounded like, called an idiot with a robot voice... the list goes on. But this is the first time I’ve dealt with someone threatening suicide over an order that wasn’t even technically late yet. It floored me, honestly.

I was able to deescalate her and explained shipping vs processing and apologized for misinformation. In the end she wasn’t crying anymore but I still hit me in the feels...",28,0,0
"The Joys of Retail Call Centers, Storytime and a Rant.","  

It’s long, don’t do TL;DR for the whole tale; you came for a story, you’re going to read one. Grammarly run, whatever mistakes are either on purpose or IDGAF about. 

Anyone working retail call centers or tech support for retail stores may agree with me on this, yes the customers are assholes, but the hardest thing to deal with is the in-store employees. As a lifer in call centers, customers stopped bothering me years ago, sometimes a customer’s sheer stupidity with stick with me, but that is mostly so I can imagine the ways to eliminate them from the gene pool, but I digress. In my position, I, unfortunately, must contact our physical locations or other corporate depts. regularly, this has led to some *interesting* interactions. 

I will preface the following by saying, most customers are assholes and give employees way more shit than they deserve, but when you are dealing with someone on the same team as you, don’t be a dick. In my company, the call center is loathed by the physical location staff, mainly because we force them to do their jobs and prevent them from just hanging up on callers or blowing them off; my T1 group is considered corporate agents and a report for the failure of duty from us can get an employee fired, however in the cases that it happened, 95% were the employees own doing. I will tell a story about that below. TL;DR of this preface, sometimes employees are justified in being dicks, but don’t score a goal for the opposing team. 

For All Stories

M: Me

C: Caller

E: Employee

MG: Manger/T2 Rep

Tale One: Restroom Bandit

\*Note: When calling an instore extension, it will ring to each extension in that group. This will make sense in a minute.

M: (General Greeting and info gathering) How may I help you?

C: Yes, I need to know if you have 24pk Coca-Cola in stock; they’re on sale. I spoke to E, and he said that he was in the bathroom and couldn’t look and hung up on me. 

\*At this point in my time here, this honestly doesn’t surprise me, but the part of my brain that exudes professionalism thinks, W(hy)T Effing F would you tell them that, make something up or transfer them.

M: I apologize for that; let me see if I can locate someone who will assist you. 

\*Generally, grocery is a ‘cold’ transfer, now I have to ‘warm’ transfer…

M: (Store transfer script intro), (when E said their name, I knew it was the same person caller said). Hi, I may have a customer you spoke to on the line regarding avail on (soda).

E: Yeah, I can’t do anything I am in the bathroom. So, yeah. 

\*Yes, they said, “So, yeah.”

M: I understand, is there anyone who might be able to find that out for me?

E: (Genuinely confused by this question). I don’t know, call the EXT for MG and see if they can, I gotta go. &lt;Click&gt;

\*Here is where that phone system comes into play if he is in the bathroom and ‘occupied’ he didn’t have to answer the phone, he can let it bounce to any of the other food E/MG or even let it bounce to the Store MG if no one picks up, the fact that he answered the call while answering nature’s call baffles me. 

\*Ring MG EXT

M: (Script). Yes, I need to find out if we have (soda) in stock; called grocery, and E told me they were in the bathroom and couldn’t do anything. 

MG: (audible groan of annoyance) They said they were where?

M: Bathroom

MG: (long exacerbated sigh) I am sorry, let me ask my Grocery MG.

\*Short Pause, could hear the chatter of MG repeating the location of E to Grocery MG.

MG: Thank you, no out of stock…(There was more boring info, but it doesn’t matter for here)

M: Thank you, (Script)

\*Pausing a couple of moments to laugh at the absurdity of this call and wondering is QA is pranking me to see if they can get me to break (I have a 98% QA average).

M: (Script) (Relay info)

C: Thank you. Do you know why he answered his phone in the bathroom?

M: No, I do not.

\*End of call.

Tale Two: I really fucking hate fashion &amp; Bonus: We have these EXT why?

This is a combined tale that encompasses two things that annoy the fuck out of me. The biggest being why do we have and EXT list that we are mandated to use when half our stores don’t use the EXT we are supposed to dial.

Part One: Fucking Fashion

This tale relates to our GM departments. In most of our GM areas, they can multitask, hardware may know some automotive, electronics can handle sporting goods, etc. Then there is fashion.

\*Same cast as above

\*Basics, caller wanting Sporting Good, they never pick up, call bounces.

E: Thank you for calling Fashion; this is E, how help? (yes, there was no middle to that last part)

M: Hello E, I am sorry, I have someone looking for Sporting Goods Item…

\*before I can get anything else out of my mouth

E: I FASHION, NOT SPORTING GOODS, WHY YOU CALL ME? I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT! WHY YOU NOT CALL SPORTING GOOD? 

\*The ranting continued for about a minute. Also, I am not mocking her speech; she is not American, I am not going to guess ethnic origin, but her speech was very broken. I have dealt with her a few times, and I really think she hates me. 

M: I am sorry E, I was trying to ask if you knew if anyone was in Sporting Goods right now?

\*This may have been said through gritted teeth, but I tried to keep that “Voice” during it. 

E: (sounding more pissed that I would ask her that) \*screaming again, no caps this time, you get the point. You always do this. Why you call me. I don’t know. I FASHION, you understand, fa-sh-ion (yeah, condescending annunciation with an accent.)

\*E and I have had the “How the phone system works” conversation more than I can count; they still think I am purposefully calling them. 

M: Thank you. I will contact the manager.

\*Yes, bitchy and slightly vindictive, but I am so over them. 

\*Levels the customer that I am still working on it calls MG EXT.

M: Hello MG, (Explains a TL;DR version of everything above)

MG: I will take the caller, and I will speak with E; this is the third one of you guys that has complained about them today. 

\*Put myself into “Break” state and transferred the call. 

RANT Portion of the Tale: 

There are about five departments that we have EXT for that, 98% of the locations don’t staff. They lump then together with other departments and are shocked that we would call the EXT for that DEPT and not know that the other DEPT handles them. Now, I am going on year four here (I think it might be five), and this has been going on since the beginning. I have alerted our Leads/Sups/KB Overlords; pretty much anyone who will listen, and that my emails don’t bounce when I send them. NOTHING has been done about it until we now have to WARM transfer to one because calls were continually dropping. You may be asking yourself, “If you know this, why don’t you just transfer to the EXT you know they use?” Good question, here is the answer, I fucking get marked down on QA because I am not using the EXT code listed on the EXT sheet.

Further gripe, one of the QAs that marked me down even noted in the notes that they called the correct EXT, and it was dead, and they called MG and was told the other EXT handles that department’s calls. I still lost points. That one really pissed me off because it took away my perfect month, 5/6 QA were 100%, and that one, 92% with a flag for ‘failing to follow transfer guidelines.’ I had to have a meeting with my TL about it. He told me he would forward the 25 emails I have sent him regarding the EXT to the higher-ups again, and we chatted about my new computer for the rest of the 15-minute meeting (I love my TL. He’s awesome and trying to get me a promotion right now).

Okay, this is long enough—storytime over chickadees. I will post Part Two when I next feel like thinking about work. It is 8:29 PM on a Monday, I am logged out early for a headache, and I am off for the next two days.",29,0,0
Getting Annoyed By Irresponsible Customers,"I'm probably the only one in this, but man I'm finding customers to be extremely annoying.

This last call I've had is like getting on my nerves.

First, it's about a woman who said ""It's not fair I have to pay late payments charges for my bill when your website isn't working"" then goes on a rant...

Ma'am, you've literally had an entire year worth of bills you haven't paid. It is not the company's fault, you're not able to log in. It is not my fault you don't know how to use a username and password. It's not our fault you refuse to use other methods to pay your bill such as over the phone, check, credit, cash at Walmart etc. You had a whole year to call us to fix this issue or even pay your bill. To me, this sounds like an excuse to get out of late payment charges and why you can't pay your bills.

Next to pour salt over the wound, you have 50 million issues to bring my Average Handle Time up.

Even worse, it was fifteen minutes after closing.

I swear one of these days I'm going to get fired for making little remarks to customers or definitely get fired when I tell them to please get off my line.

I ended up interrupting the customer's late payment charge rant after placing $14 credit out of sheer annoyance saying ""I've waived the rest of your fees, have I resolved all of your concerns?"" faster than Usain Bolt finishing half of a 100-meter sprint and used the maximum $25 Late Payment Charge waiving just to get her off the line.",50,0,0
The customer put me on hold...,"I had a fun phone call today!! I work in a financial aid department. We have people on hold for a while before they get to us and we play hold music.

Then all of a sudden I hear our hold music, but it sounds a little different... at first I was confused then realized the caller was playing our hold music on his piano!! He said he thought it’d be funny to play it back to me and he was right, lol.

It’s the little things :)",995,0,0
A tale from the other side,"Hoping it's ok for me to post this as the customer not the call taker! Warning - has a sad start to it, bit worth it in the end I believe! It's also kind of lengthy, but details play a major role in the story.

Back in early June, my Mother-in-law (who was the true center of our family and my dearest friend) passed away very suddenly. My Father-in-law lives over 3 hours from us and cannot live alone(several strokes, rebuilt shoulder, steel cage in his back and mild-moderate dementia) Thanks to Covid-19 I have been working from home since March so it wasn't too difficult to just shift to his house. We just didn't want to pull him away from his home too quickly after losing his wife and caregiver. 

One day we woke up to their satellite cable being out - living with an elderly man who is mostly bed bound and has dementia makes this pretty much an emergency lol. I tried trouble shooting on my own power cycling the box and checking through forums and FAQs to try several ways of fixing it but had to break down and call for help lol. 

Based on many companies world wide being short staffed and working from home when possible I'm sure most of you are aware there can be lengthy hold times. This is fine with me, I always operate from a place of positivity when needing to reach out to a call center. Even in a situation where I'm angry about a situation, I remain aware that the person who takes my call is not responsible for the situation and also sometimes isn't able to help fix what I need without going through their prescribed scripts and troubleshooting steps. I was definitely at my wit's end with our general situation but really did my best to maintain a cheerful tone, which is what Momma would have done too.

Initially there were some astronomical hold times, one of which was just under 2 hours... at which point I was disconnected from the call not of my own doing. I escalated my way through a few service reps and of course had to go through the same steps/troubleshooting each time.

The account was only in my Mother-in-law's name. So every single time I would get someone new, I would have to say she had passed away and therefore I didn't know her security code. Several times we tried the security question she had set up - Who was her favorite singer? - to no avail. I tried everything I could think of (The Traveling Wilburies, Kenny Rogers, Elvis Presley, Garth Brooks, Shania Twain to name a few) I knew she liked and her husband gave several options (Merle Haggard, Hank Williams Jr, gospel, the Beatles, Roy Orbison, among others) as well but we just could not get it. I even tried Jesus himself. We must have tried 30 different options!

Obviously I understood the security parameters but after over 10 hours trying to navigate this on the phone and having to say she had died SO many times I was just an emotional wreck. We finally reached a point where they decided to send someone out to check equipment, this was after being on the phone with the same person for an hour or so. He was very helpful and kind and also got a bit emotional when I started audibly crying when I had to tell him I lost my best friend. 

While waiting for some power cycles to run their course he let me tell him a bit about her and he told me he was gonna call his Grandpa when he got off work and that I had inspired him to love his family a bit more intentionally. He kept telling me really appreciated my positive tone after all I'd been through on these calls and with all that was happening in my life between Momma and suddenly becoming a primary caregiver to a man who is a handful on his best days lol. He issued me a credit to our account to offset requesting an expedited on site visit. Then he had to transfer me to the department to get me scheduled. 

I ended up on hold for them around an hour and 15 mins, it was like 8pm at this point. The lady picked up and asked for the security pin and I just lost it. I mean I was sobbing and it took me a few minutes to even speak. We got me scheduled for the next day. She asked if there was anything else and I asked if she could help me update the account so I wouldn't have to continue going through the security PIN issue anymore. She said she could call the number attached to the account since it was a landline and I could change it that way without identifying myself.
So she called the house and I got the PIN changed, still crying. Once we were done she dropped her voice pretty low and before we hung up she said ""Just remember, if you get asked again - the favorite singer is Queen.""

??? Queen lmao!! In a million years I would never gotten to Queen lmao. We've asked everyone in the family since then and NO ONE has ever guessed Queen. 

Anyway, based on her lowered volume and I could hear she was in a call center, I assume she wasn't supposed to tell me but after hours of actual tears and frustration this little act of kindness had me doubled over laughing. I could hear her smile when she told me to have a good night. Her and the gentleman before her really helped alleviate the unbearable stress of the day I was having and I'll never forget it!

Anyway, sorry so lengthy, I hope some of you read all the way through and got a small kick out of it at the minimum! Have a great day call center heroes!!!

I hope you all get diarrhea.,"So, today I had a customer tell me that he hopes every single employee of my company gets diarrhea ""for an entire month"".

All of us. No exceptions. 

Our collective crime? 

He wanted to watch a specific tv show, but when he tuned to that channel, Conan O'Brien was on instead. 

And he fucking HATES Conan O'Brien, you guys. 

Like why tf would this tv network choose to show Conan O'Brien instead of something with punching things and explosions? 

I don't know to be honest. I am but a simple inbound  technical support representative for a large US based ISP/Cable/Phone provider. 

If the curse stands true, we will all potentially die of dysentery within the next 30 days, and have Conan O'Brien to thank for our fate.

Technician and his sandwich that gave him away.,"Is it time for another Big Momma call center story? Yes it is! 

So this customer (Steve) calls in: 

“Hi, I’ve had a tech scheduled for today to upgrade my house wiring and install two new tvs but nobody showed up. Can you tell me what happened?”

“Sure I can, please bear with me, I will look into it.” ——— “Steve, I have the appoitment in front of me and it is marked as “customer was not at his premisses”. Please don’t take this the wrong way, I am still looking into it, but were you home for the entire duration of the appoitment time frame?”

“Yeah! I was home the entire day and I swear nobody came to my house, nobody knocked on the door, nobody rang the bell or even called me. There was this guy in a van that I thought could be your tech but he was just standing around for a bit, ate his sandwich and left.” (Note the sandwich part as it is important to the story). 

“Ok Steve, let me put you on hold and call the dispatch center(DC) for more info” 

I must addmit, I was sceptical about my customer telling the truth as many of our customer lie if they missed the dispatch (I don’t know why, there were no fines and we would just reschedule but I digress). So I called the DC to find out if customer is a dirty liar or if we fucked up on our end to see if customer is eligible for credit and how to make sure we don’t fuck up again. 

So I’m talking to this lady from DC:

Me: “My customer is claiming he was home all day but tech never arrived. Can you check for me please?”

DC lady: “Sure!”——“So I pulled up the case in question and have it marked as customer missed dispatch. GPS says tech was at the adress and notes from tech are: *arrived at prem. Cx (customer) not at home. Cx no response on mobile. Waited 15 min. Ate sandwich. Left.* “ 

Me laughing: “I’m sorry what about sandwich?” 

“Sorry don’t mind that. I guess the tech tried to be funny.”

“Not only that. He outed himself! My customer actually mentioned a guy he thought could be our tech waiting around eating sandwich but he didn’t made any contact. Do you think the tech just did not feel like working that day?”

“I’m not sure but it does sound like that. I will flag this for investigation. Can you provide me with case number where we can pull the recording of customer mentioning the sandwich?” 

“Yeah no worries, its xxxxx. Thanks for your help!”

So I went back to my customer, did not tell him the whole story but admited and apologized for a scheduling issue on our end and gave him the maximum credit I could for a missed dispatch plus discount on his new tv receivers that were supposed to be installed and rescheduled with him. Cx was happy with the outcome. 

I also texted the DC rep asking her for the screenshot of tech notes so I can share it with my friends. She complied and texted me again few days later telling me that the tech admited to not wanting to do long install job and got suspended without pay for two weeks. 

Moral of the story? Who knows...
Thanks for reading.

Today,"Saturday. 7am. Alarm rings.

I’m quick to spring out of bed, but that’s only to snooze the alarm and return to the fleeting warmth trapped under the blankets. 9 minutes later again the alarm rings. A pernicious cycle of getting up only to return immediately continues until 7:55 am. Admitting defeat, I knew I couldn’t snooze again. I growled walking to my desk. A mere 20 feet from my bed to the chair where I would spend the next 9 hours of my life wishing I was dead. I never was a coffee person. I sometimes wonder if that’s why the mornings always felt extra rough, though I wasn’t a fan of the jitteriness alternative either.

On my desk were 3 monitors, 1 large one in the center and two slightly smaller ones on each side. The center and right monitors were reserved for my main working activities while the left one was reserved for the disquieting purpose of displaying the call queue.

I sat in the chair staring blankly ahead. What began was a session of leering at the impending doom of what waits for me. Those early morning minutes were ones I hated the most. Knowing that there was a fresh young day ahead of me, ripe with opportunity, an abundance of possibility. Yet I could only see it through what felt like the window of a jail cell, reminding me that today would not be that day. No, instead I would be handed a day filled with anxiety, frustration, and unfulfillment.

It was 14 minutes past 8. I still hadn’t moved. My morning routine consisted of me getting to my desk, doing the absolute bare minimum to sign into the computer, then doing nothing. Absolutely Nothing. Sitting there staring off into the distance. Or more often than not, closing my eyes and placing my head on top of my arms on my desk. Sometimes staring at the carpet beneath me other times remaining in the darkness surrounded by the silence. I was trying to escape. Trying to seek shelter from the world, from what was about to happen. Trying to bring back peace to my own mind and body. Trying to forget, maybe even just for a second, that I wasn’t here. The attempts were futile, only delaying the inevitable, or on some occasions making it worse.

Then of course there were the tics (motor-tics). Moments where my whole-body twitches in an uncontrolled involuntary movement as if I was flinching from a gunshot going off in the next room. These began a few months back and would happen every so often when I lied down to sleep. But as my stress continued to grow so did the frequency. Eventually they even followed me from my bed to my desk. Whenever I was to place my head down and try to close my eyes the tics would chase me, making me realize that I can’t even escape to my own mind without being chased. On one severe occasion while placing my head down the phone next to me rang, causing me to flinch so dramatically it was truly painful. The way my body reacted had frightened me. I remember the overwhelming feelings immediately after of sorrow and remorse that I had ever let it get this far. That I hadn’t stopped this sooner or gotten help.

I looked up at call queue. 3 calls in queue. There was only one other employee working currently and he was already on a call for 8 minutes now. My second coworker wasn’t set to start working until 30 minutes later. But that was it. Just us three guys. Three soldiers in the trenches, set to stave off what felt like an unrelenting horde for the next 9 hours.

I felt like I let the anticipation build up for long enough. I took the first call. It was a young gentleman that had a question that frankly had nothing to do with IT at all, but instead was suited more for HR. This was a common occurrence as no other department in the company had a support phone line other than IT. I explained to him in a detached tone that he would need to email the HR department with his inquiry and wait for a response from them. His tone changed from probing to one of irate with a hint of mistrust. As he explained to me that he had already done such thing and still received no such response his choice in words made it seem like he believed I knew the answer to his original question, yet I was withholding it for some reason. And that maybe he would be able to strongarm it out of me. But no, I did not. If I had I would have gladly told him it because I knew that would have been the quickest way to make him go away. I told him once more that only HR would be able to assist him and then ended the call. (2 min 11 sec)

I waited for a bit before the next call. I always do now. When I had first started, I used to be able to churn out call after call. Seldom ever using the allotted 2 minutes of *after call wrap* (ACW — additional time after each call before the next to complete a ticket or paperwork). Though now I use every second I’ve got. I actually use more than I’ve got. A colleague early on taught me a trick to extend the ACW after a call for as long as I need to before going back into available or taking the next call from the queue. It was a handy trick but one to be used sparingly. If the use of it got too high it would prompt a conversation from my manager discouraging its use. But that only mattered back when I cared about my job.

Let’s get one thing clear. I am not a good employee. I was. I might still be able to be. But currently I am not. I could care less if I am on time. I could care less if I am meeting metrics or standards. I could care less if I have 200 overdue tickets in my queue. Something has caused this apathy. Maybe its burnout, maybe it’s the fact that these are trying times the world is in currently, or maybe it’s because management doesn’t seem to care either. We have been severely understaffed since back in November when people began to leave our team. Help Desk is an entry position, so it’s not expected of you to stay there forever. Don’t get me wrong some do and end up stuck there for what feels like forever. But the idea is to move on at a certain point. The problem arose when all of these people left their positions, but the positions were never refilled. The size of our team continued to slowly decrease over the year all while we were entering the busiest period we had ever seen. Management doesn’t seem to care that we are understaffed and overworked. Or at least they don’t seem to be doing anything about it.

I take the next call. It’s an older Hispanic man. He speaks in broken English. He’s having an issue with the time punch software and he can’t log his hours. He is one of our contractors down in the southern part of the state who works with the roofing teams. He is upset because this is the third time this week he has had to call us for support. I am upset because this is the third time this week he has had to call us for support. However, I empathize for this gentleman and the many like him at the company. He works in the field and fulfills a general contractor position. The most advanced piece of technology he uses is a 2010 Motorola Razr. Yet in order to do something as simple as clock in and clock out he has to navigate multiple sites and use two different usernames and passwords that he is expected to remember. This man never thought he would need a degree in computer science just to cash a paycheck as a roofer. I listen to him rant and afterwards I reset one of his passwords. He is able to log in now. He continues to spout about how he shouldn’t have to go through all of this and how all of this is a waste of time and that he shouldn’t have to remember two usernames and two passwords. I ignore him and ask him if there is anything else I can assist him with. He says no and hangs up the phone. (16 min 32 sec)

The longer calls (anything over 6 minutes really) always seem to take the most damage on me. There’s something about taking 15 minutes to solve an issue that should have only taken 3 but couldn’t because you needed to over explain everything in the beginning and try to test every single aspect of it afterwards. All while you hold me hostage. Like a teller who you’ve made open the safe but you refuse to leave or let us go until you have counted every last bill inside. As if somehow there would be any different outcome based on the amount. You’ve got your money. Now leave me alone.

I try to get up and walk away from my desk. But I’m not sure where to go. I know I’ll have to come right back, so why even leave in the first place? The chains only let you reach so far anyway. I try to cope the same way I do after every call, by either using my phone and scrolling for a distraction or placing my head down. I’m not sure what makes me put my head down on my desk the way I do. I guess I get a false comfort from it. I’m still a bit tired and with my head on the desk I start to doze. A tic hits me and I violently jerk. I can feel an increased pressure in my chest, but I can’t tell if its real or all in my head. I look at the clock. 9:00am. 8 more hours to go.

Edit: Thanks for the responses guys. Few things. No this was not a fictitious creative writing exercise. This was a therapeutic outlet of an actual depiction of my day today (and many similar days before it). I am not a writer. As far as mental health, I know I have some mental issues and am working on them with professionals :) but it's not an overnight process. Thanks for caring tho. It means a lot.

Also I decided before I posted this that today was the last day I am taking phone calls. It's been an ongoing discussion for a while with management and I think today was my breaking point. I'm sure I'll be able to do something else of value for the company. If not, that's what savings are for. My job should not cost me my mental health.

"""It's not fair that I got this text and I can't get the deal!""","As most telcos do, they send out ads through flyers or texts, or even email blasts to let people know **""what amazing offers and discounts we have if you switch over to us or renew you contract today!""**

Yeah, well. I had the pleasure of speaking with this gem of a gentleman. This was right before I went on maternity leave so I was a pretty pissy agent.

So there was me and the arsehole I'll call Arse.

Me: Thanks for calling, this is me! How can I help you out?

Arse: It's bullshit that you're texting us these deals, right? I can't get them at all!

Me: I'm sorry, sir. Let me pull up your account first so I see what you're talking about. \*verifies account, sees that he's a customer with about a year left in his contract\*

Okay, so are you talking about a loyalty rate plan?

Arse: No! Stupid... I'm talking about these deals! They say I can upgrade to a (phone better than what he currently has) with zero down payment and get (rate plan significantly lower)! I got a text saying I could get it!

Me: Well, that's correct sir. I checked the account and you're eligible to do that upgrade if you wish.

Arse: Well yeah, but I would have to pay you, right?

Me: ??? Pay us... for the plan?

Arse: No, you idiot! For the phone! This phone! You know, the one I'm talking to you on? I have to buy out my contract and pay the balance before I can get my new phone, right?

Me: Well, yes sir. Since you'll be starting over a new contract, you have to pay off the balance for the phone. Of course, it's not gonna be right now. It will just show up on your next statement.

Arse: This is what I'm talking about. Why would you send us this stuff if we still have to pay for it?! It doesn't make any sense...

Me: Well, we let people know that we have new offers every now and then. So we send ads out to people so they become aware.

Arse: But it's a lie, I can't get it for free.

Me: You can get the new device for free, but you have to either have no contract or pay off your old phone.

Arse: This is bullshit. Why would you send texts out?

**Lord bless me, I actually said:** Don't flatter yourself, you aren't the only customer we have. If you don't want it, just delete the text.

  
Tl,dr: Arse had about a year left on his contract, got a text about a promotion and got mad that we had a promotion, told him not to feel special.

I got in trouble for it with *my* asshole manager but the manager who took the call did think it was funny as heck. I was a pretty decent agent, just got an attitude while pregnant and hungry. As far as I knew, Arse did not get the promo because he was unwilling to pay $600 plus tax for his old phone.",73,0,0

A point of curiosity...,"I've been digging this sub so far, thanks to all who gave feedback on my previous post. Since my first contribution was negative, I thought I'd go in a different direction with this one. I assume we've all been taught tactics to politely ""wrap it up"" with particularly chatty customers, because we've all got numbers and quotas and blah blah blah...

That being said, has anyone ever just said damn the numbers and gone on a conversational joyride with a slightly senile and/or extremely garrulous consumer just for the heck of it? The other week, I got this 90-something-year-old lady on the phone who very early on in the call stated her intent to place an order. After I'd gotten everything in her cart, however, she'd already begun leading the conversation in some pretty non-shoe-related directions including (but not limited to) the Chernobyl disaster, how New York used to be in the 40s, her role as a science and chemistry teacher, during which she (allegedly) had a very adversarial relationship with the school administrators and repeatedly came close to blowing up the school. I subtly tried to redirect her a few times, but once we were 40 minutes into the call I just kinda said ""f-it,"" and let her take me down the rabbit trail. We talked about past presidents, the development of race and gender relations she'd witnessed throughout her life, and her debatably-legitimate government research credentials (she told me that, in addition to teaching science, she also helped lead research on various DOD technology/weapons/explosives). It was, all told, an 1h 45m call, and I was fortunately not given any crap from my sup. She did, after all, end up placing the order, so I was technically still doing my job lol. Obviously I usually try to keep conversations fairly brief, but just wondering who else has indulged a rambling caller just for personal amusement.",25,0,0

“Well, I was not at home. Only my son was but I pulled up my security camera video. Two guys came in with a white van, told my son they are from your company and just cut the cable going to our house, loaded it into the van and drove away!” 

“Ok Jane, I’m sorry to hear that. That is indeed an odd scenario. What is even weirder is that I can see your services connected without any interuptions. Have you checked your tv and internet if they work? Are you sure it was our cable?” 

“Well I did not check, I assumed it would not work without it. It was definitelly your cable, we had you over like 6 weeks ago to install it. Im checking on the services right now”

Jane: “Ok the services are working! How is that possible?!”

“Well I was actually able to find out the answer for that while you were checking. We did have our guys over at your house today. I pulled up the technician notes and it states that they removed your temporary aerial line as the main line was connected and buried last week.”

“Oh yeah I remeber, is that what they were doing last week?” 

“Yes exactly. I apologize for the confusion”

“Oh no, thats fine. So are you sure we don’t need the stolen cable?”

“Yes Jane, I’m sure” 

“Ok, I believe you. Will we get some credit for it being stolen?”

“The cable was not really stolen as it was not yours to begin with so unfortenatelly I don’t see anything that would justify crediting your account”

Pretty basic tale ... first post.,"Not a very exciting one but I work in a call center for ""ACME Shoes,"" and had a guy call in complaining that his admittedly-overpriced-and-likely-average-quality footwear from our ""premium line"" had sustained an undue amount of insole degradation within roughly 2 months of use. Annoying, sure, but I was incredibly apologetic and politely directed him to the defective product form, informing him he would almost certainly be granted full compensation (via gift card) for the purchase price. He seemed pretty okay with this, but I was beginning to hear some increasingly discontented chatter in the background (which, as I'm sure you all know, is never a good sign). Suddenly, I'm subjected to a level-10-rage-fueled tirade from some Karen Jr., who I'm sure has never wanted for anything in her entire life, saying she needed to speak with someone who could ""actually help,"" and that she wasn't waiting ""6-8 weeks for a \*\*curse word\*\* email response from our defective product team (our email turnaround time, btw, is 48-72 hrs. max, which I had also explained earlier in the call). I tried to convey that the defective product form was the only way to go about receiving a replacement pair and/or gift card, but this guy's terror of a girlfriend was having none of it. Also, in her nonsensical diatribe she was more or less indicating she'd never order from ""ACME"" again, while simultaneously insisting that ""something be done."" So you want a replacement pair of our allegedly horrendous shoes, but a gift card to order said shoes just won't do, and you're never patronizing us again...? Nice logic. Once she was done, she said something snippy like ""I've got more important things to do,"" and immediately I heard a vacuum start running (yeah, I'm sure your precious Saturday chores just couldn't wait, lady). Anyway, the now-emasculated guy gets back on the phone, and I told him I'd send his replacement pair out right away, confirming his style, size and delivery address just to really drive the bold-faced lie home. Once he hung up, I deleted all evidence of the call (thank god our software allows us to do that), and am intending to completely ghost him/especially her. Also making a sticky note of their number on my laptop with bold, capital-lettered ""NO.""",16,0,0
Man... what a weird week,"I've just had possibly the most colorful week I've ever had working phone tech chat support.

First entry goes to the dude who sent me a photo of his wireless Bluetooth earbuds. It was making a rattling sound and he wanted me to see if the device had any physical damage he may have not noticed, so he sent me a photo. From the angle he took the shot, some inner portion of the white eartips that are attached to the earbuds could be seen. Inside that portion, I spot a clump of black... thing. Mind goes, ""...is that his fuckin' earwax?""

I zoom in, and blessed be the gods of high quality cameras, indeed there it is: his fuckin' earwax and it's quite the clump. I tap my colleague, ""okay look here — what do you see?""

Colleague: ""...uhhh what the fuck?"" 

Me: ""Well, what do you see?"" 

C: ""Is that earwax...?""

Him and I burst out laughing. I show the photo to the people near us and everyone gets their share of hysterical gaggles. 

Me: Do I still ask him to clean the earbuds as usual? I mean look at it!!!

*hysterical laughter from everyone*

C: Fuck cleaning the earbuds have him clean his ears!

Second C: Good thing we don't require they ship us back faulty ear tips if we send a replacement. Imagine if he sent it back and the earwax came with it!

*TL gets curious and joins in, gets infected by laughter*

Second entry goes to the chick who, after successful verification...

Me: So how can I help?

Her: I'm pregnant with 2 children.

Me: *waits to see if she's gonna send any more messages*

Her: *no icon indicating she's typing*

Me: *waits 4 minutes*

Her: *nope, still not typing*

Me: I'm happy to hear that! Congratulations, then. :) Now... what issue can I help you with?

Her: Say my name out loud.

Me: (remember this was through chat and not phones) Okay, I'll humor you.

Me: {FIRSTNAME.} {LASTNAME} 

Me: Hahaha, there you go. :) Kidding aside though, do you actually have a [companyname]-related tech issue?

Her: *disconnects*

3rd entry goes to the missus who chatted with me and flat out clarified she doesn't have any issues with our company or products, just that she'd like me to pretend I'm her mom. Asked her why and apparently she just got diagnosed with breast cancer and she's torn up unsure how to tell her mom. This took me off guard and I honestly got confused how I'd handle this situation and was still thinking of a reply when she goes ahead and starts her little roleplay. Types in, ""Mom? Can we talk?""

I still couldn't think of anything to say or if I should even handle this at all or insist I can't really chat about non-company related conversations. She goes and types in ""((please, are you still there? Just pretend and let me practice how I'll tell mom))""

If that wasn't bad enough, I'm personally the kind of guy who's better at providing solutions to life issues and just the WRONG guy to go for emotional support. I fuckin' suck at that shit and I just know I'm least qualified to be handling this woman.

Few seconds counting down and I'd soon be flagged for poor response time by the system so I type in a simple ""yea I'm here"" then she goes on and rants again how she feels so utterly devastated with her current situation. Thankfully when she finished, she said goodbye and ended the chat and also apologized for any trouble she caused.

I still wonder what the hell happened there and how it ended up for her.",32,0,0
“A goodwill credit”,"Cast: 
Me - me duh
POLICYHOLDER- PH

I work in an auto insurance call center. In certain states even if you don’t physically have a vehicle in your possession, if you have the plates registered to you, you have to keep insurance on the car until you surrender your plates. This call is one such state. Our PH insured a car with us, sold the car on June 2, kept the plates, returned said plates on July 30, then called to get coverage deleted as of June 2, and a credit for all of July. 

Me: So sir, I can definitely backdate cancelation or coverage to June. But that will mean that from June2 to the day you turned in the plates, you will have a valid lapse of coverage. This will result in fines/penalties from the DMV in your state and may result in license suspension. 

PH: no. 

Me: I’m sorry sir? 

PH: No. I don’t accept those terms. I don’t want any fines or lapses or anything. 

Me: of course sir. So to avoid those issues let’s take coverage off, effective for the date you actually turned in the plates, the 30th of July. 

PH: Okay and then what will my July refund be? 

Me: So, since we would be looking at providing insurance coverages and service for all of July, there would be no July refund. 

PH:  No. There will be because I didn’t have the car for July. I’m not going to pay insurance for a car I don’t have! 

Me: I understand your frustration sir. However, for the state you live in, the law is you turn in the plates and then turn off the insurance the day you turn in those plates. 

PH: Well it was Corona virus, that means I get no fines because DMV was closed. If I get fines your company has to pay them because no one told me about them. 

(Reviews policy notes where PH has been advised of penalties no less than 3 times for this incident and had a suspension before because of the same thing for a different car, multiple escalations due to this)

Me: I’m sorry sir, but per our contract we will not be liable for any fees accrued due to lapse of coverages. We provide you information and if you decide to take the insurance off after we have advised against it, you are responsible for the consequences. 

PH: Then you’re giving me a good will credit. I’ve worked in customer service. You’ll do it for the amount I had to pay for July. 

Me: I’m sorry sir, that will not be possible. We insured you for July, we have to charge for the services we provided. It’s not fair to everyone else if we give away free services because you don’t like the laws where you live. 

PH: No. I worked for customer service all through the 80s I know you can give me a good will credit. Get me your supervisor. 
 
Me: of course sir. 

My supervisor came on the line, told him the same thing, sent him the itemized bill, and a copy of the state law in an email. 

But of course I get a bad survey because, “She prioritized the LAW over good customer service.”",310,0,0
This is ridiculous,"I’m on a roll for bad calls today. 

As stated in prior posts, I work in an auto insurance call center. 

Cast: 
Me = Bee 
Ms. Policyholder = MSPH
Mr. Policyholder = MRPH

Me: Thank you for calling Insurance Co. This is Bee, am I speaking with MSPH?

MSPH: yeah yeah. I have my 6 month renewal paperwork and you guys are charging WAY too much. 

Me: Oh man, let me look into that for you. 

*sees 3 AT FAULT accidents in the last 6 months resulting in over $10k paid out, a couple surcharges, loss of good driver discounts, and being placed into a high risk pool*

Me: Okay MSPH so I am seeing that we were in a couple of minor accidents this last term. When these unfortunate things happen, your insurance does occasionally increase to make sure we have enough money set aside to pay for any past and future damages if they were to happen. 

MSPH: THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!! I HAVE BEEN WITH YOUR COMPANY FOR YEARS!! THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY LOYAL CUSTOMERS WHAT KIND OF SCAM ARE YOU RUNNING?!

Me: I absolutely understand your frustration MSPH. I can see we definitely protected you from the $XX,XXX amount that was paid out for the accidents so that is really great. But let me look into what further discounts we can offer you! 

*Sees discount option of taking a safety course, would discount the policy $340/6 month term, also Multi-line which would save $235/6 month*

Me: GREAT! So I am seeing here that you absolutely have the potential for some amazing discounts! I see if you and MRPH were to take the driver safety course, you would save -

MSPH: I AM NOT GOING TO DO THAT! You people keep mentioning that course every time I call in to get my bill lowered and I am NEVERRRRR going to do it. 

Me: *internally maybe we recommend it because it’s going to SAVE you some serious $$$* Absolutely. Well if you could get MRPH to do it, that wou -

MSPH: ARE YOU DUMB?!!?! WE ARE NEVERR GOING TO DO THAT. YOU NEED TO MAKE THE PRICE LOWER. 

Me: Of course and I am definitely looking into how we can do that for you. One option is these courses and the other would be bundling your home and auto which —

MSPH: IM NOT DOING ANYTHING. I WANT WHAT I HAVE NOW FOR WHAT I WAS PAYING LAST TIME OR IM LEAVING YOUR SCAM OF A COMPANY!!! YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE MY COST LOWER RIGHT NOW! 

Me: Well MSPH I have gone over our available options. We are currently at baseline for your policy. 

MSPH: NO. Make me an offer. 

Me: For the service you currently have, without pursuing the discounts I have offered, *Original $ amount* is as low as this policy goes. 

MSPH: You didn’t give me ANY discounts!!!!

Me: MSPH, your discount options are the safety course or the bundle discount.

MSPH: NO YOU HAVE TO OFFER MORE! 

Me: MSPH, I have gone over our options. Is there anything else I can help you with before I disconnect the line?

MSPH: YOU DIDN’T HELP ME AT ALL!!!! IM GOING TO TELL FACEBOOK WHAT A SCAM INSURANCE CO IS AND YOU WILL BURN IN HELL!!!!

It was beyond simple. Not the exact password I forget it, but lets just say it was ""easy1"". After giving to me, He was it is the name of the fraternity I was in  during college, but with the number 1 after it.  I had to inform him that was a  terrible password.  Told him if they know you, they can possibly guess the name of the fraternity you went too.  He was well I got a number 1 after it. I had to explain. This is still terrible and it should be a more of a random password. Something  that people would not guess by researching you just a little.  He was pretty reasonable and I helped him to create one.  He did much better. Enough so. I told him that if you forget it. You need to go to a Store with ID to have it changed if he forgets.

"Be nice to your call centres, they may be nice back","To all you people who call up to big corporation call centres:

Being nice gets you ahead in the world. Same applies to call centres. Today I will recount 2 separate tales both times I was nice and got extra things

So let’s start with company A, I’ve been using their music service for about 2 years, been paying for a base music package but recently my plan was about to end. So I’m scrolling though and see a new member offer for 70 or 80% off a year plus a free smart speaker. So I call company A, and nicely ask about this offer seeing if it’s just for new members (obviously it is). I sprinkle in a few oh damns and ask if there’s anything similar for current members. This angel is like let me try this code, and BOOM! The offer works, I thank her and wish her a good day. If I had yelled I don’t think she might have tried.

So later I try to get that smart speaker, find out there’s an issue on company b’s end where the code isn’t working correctly, no big deal. So I chat with the guy and say this code ain’t working right, no yelling just saying I must have entered it in wrong or something, supervisor gets involved because we can’t fix it, and somehow this supervisor is the second angel of the day and just gives me a second smart speaker because of the issue I had. Obviously I thank him profusely and wish him a good day.

So if your reading this, don’t be a dick, your call centre folk will appreciate it. They deal with dickheads all day, simple human decency will get you farther

Grandma’s credit card,"Me: credit card call center chick 🐥 
GD: granddaughter of card member

Typical day, explaining how interest works, taking payments, disputing fraudulent charges. 
GD calls, I do my open, immediately she is all attitude. HOW DARE WE have a policy in which when a primary card member is reported as deceased, we close the account and ask any authorized users to reapply. 

GD is all bent out of shape because her grandmother will have to reapply, wait for a decision and then wait for a card. GD insists this is cruel and unusual punishment because the grandmother uses the card a lot. And WE WILL
expedite that card to Grandma AS SOON as it is available. 

Of course “I regret that this causes inconvenience for your grandma, but we are unable to expedite the first card of an new account. “  Then the GD follows up with how they will just apply for another card. 

Whatever. Do what you have to do.

What bothered me the most is that GD can bow up all big and try to get her way with the credit card company, but the family can’t help poor grandma out? Woman has just lost her husband and family won’t help her for two weeks while she’s waiting for a credit card. I wanted to say that so bad, but I need this job so I didn’t. So I’m going to say it here: why don’t you get your sorry ass family together and decide how you can help Grandma get through this time, rather than making the cc the bad guy ? Oh, it’s easier to make us the bad guy? Back it up, GD, and start pointing your blame finger at yourself.

"Customer lies about getting her device balance waived, I call her out, her account ends up going to collections","I have since left the call center industry but I still have a hell of a lot of stories to tell, and I remembered this piece of work when I was a representative for a Canadian telco. Title of the post is basically the TL,DR but I still remember how this call went done clear as day.

Cast: Bitch customer (BC), Me (M), Super Supervisor (SS)

M: Thanks for calling, my name is M, how can I help?

BC: I was calling about upgrading my phone but got disconnected from the other girl who was helping me. Anyway, she was gonna do it for me over the phone and waive off my device balance.

(the device balance is her termination fee for the contract and she still had 6 months left, that was over $400 and there was no way in hell that we were waiving that)

M: Let me check the account for you.

So I go over the account, and I see a note from the rep who turns out to be in the same call center I was in, and she actually put the call on hold to check if we could give the customer a discount because we couldn't waive the entire $400 off, but BC disconnected because I'm sure she knew she was gonna be told no.

M: Hi there, BC. I'm checking your account and the rep didn't say she was going to waive the balance off for you. She said she was going to check and you had disconnected the call. As it stands, you still have 6 months left on your contract and we won't be able to waive the charges.

Cue BC having a fit about how she's been a loyal customer with us for 20 years (she's been with us for 3) and that other companies would do this to make their loyal customers happy (no they wouldn't). She demanded to speak with a supervisor because I guess she realized we were gonna note her account about her BS anyway and she might as well just get stuff escalated.

I went and got SS who was known on the floor to be a no nonsense kind of guy, and if policy said so, he wasn't gonna break or bend it without good reason. SS called the Level 2 support to confirm if there were any credits they could give BC, and L2 offered $50 out of the $400 plus tax. SS added something like $10 or so on top of that, and told BC she could take it or leave it.

BC, in true Karen fashion, said she was gonna cancel her account and take her services elsewhere. SS told me to note exactly what happened, and I thought it was the end of it.

Well, a few days later, BC calls back and gets a different rep on the floor. She was trying to cancel her service but *still* get the credit that we were offering, but she was told (and I documented the account) that the credit was only applicable if she was upgrading her phone with us. BC lies through her teeth and says we never told her this, and SS tells the agent to tell her we can pull up a recording of the phone call if she wanted us to. BC hangs up.

Months later, I notice a call evaluation (I never read my evaluations haha) and it just so happened to be this specific call my own team leader listened to, and so I take a peek at her account. BC cancelled her account, never paid the $400 balance, and it went into third party collections.

I wish customers could listen to their recordings...,"I can understand customers being frustrated, but the whole, ""I know it's not your fault specifically,"" doesn't amount to much when they're still actively yelling and cursing. 


I really wish the customers were able to hear the recordings of their angry calls. They think that these conversations exist in a void (even though they constantly reference how their last call was recorded and so-and-so told them they could have X so pull the call) and have no fear of being embarrassed by their tone and words. 


If they could listen to themselves I think they'd mind their manners a lot more.


I had a woman call in at my last center screaming about how she was going to bring the wrath of the BBB down upon ""My"" company because we wouldn't replace her AC after her husband jammed a wrench in it trying to fix it himself, saying the black and Hispanic contractors we hire are this, that, and etc. Just proper screaming the entire time and bringing up my handle time.

"No sir, our marketing team is not Google","Longtime lurker on mobile. 

I (23F) work for a strictly online company which is parent to two very specialized (and very different) niches of automotive accessories. We have 26 people in the entire company, i say good morning to the CEO and his VP brother every morning. Our marketing team has done a fantastic job of creating the presence of a large company. If you google any keyword of probably 1000+ strings that could lead you to our website, our sponsored ads will show up. And haunt you, cue Old Man. 

Old Man calls in and gets me just after lunch, so i have some energy to put up with BS. He informs me he looked at our website, did not find what he was looking for, and asks if i would stop flooding his screen with our products. I'm fairly young, i know how ads and cookies work. I also knew there was no possible way I could get this man to understand. 

I gentally explain how we dont personally send ads to his computer, they are generated by the browser he is using based on websites he's viewed in the past. Old Man doesnt believe me, asks for the name of and to be sent to the man that has been sending him these popups because he isn't interested. Nothing else interesting happened except for me being caught in a cycle of no I can't transfer you, those are called ads, please contact your ISP to learn how to stop them (last ditch attempt to get him off my phone, he couldn't tell me what browser or search engine he was using so i couldn't even attempt to help him). Eventually he got off my phone and my coworker closest to me bursts out laughing because I was the only one who had a call that whole time, in an small but spacious office of 6 people including myself, so everyone got to hear my one-sided 8 minutes of dispair.

Me: Hello ____ how can I help you?

Me: Oh, okay, I'm terribly sorry about that sometimes mix-ups like this happen.  What's your name and the name of the estate and we'll sort this out.

So she gives me her name and the name of the estate.  I pull up the file...her name isn't anywhere on the file.  

Me: I'm sorry, I'm having trouble finding your name, you said you were a beneficiary correct?

Customer: Um no.

Me: Um okay, What was your relationship to (name of estate)

Customer: I don't know this person.

Okay...as she's talking I check the address and realize there was a mistake with the address.  

Me: So I've figured out the issue, it appears your address was entered incorrectly.  So you can just dispose of that check.

Customer: I can't just keep it?

(The check is $85,000)

Me: Unfortunately no it doesn't work that way.  But you can just shred it 

Customer: But this is your mistake not mine, you sent it to me so technically it is my money

Me: Um... unfortunately it doesn't work that way.  You wouldn't be able to deposit or cash the check with someone else's name on it.

Customer: Well can't I just put my name on the back?

Me: Unfortunately not Ma'am.

Customer:  You're a pathetic disgrace for a human being!

O: Does your child have any disabilities?

O: So the only reason why you're not working is because you can't find child care services for your son?

L: Yes

O: But, ma'am, you've been saying in all of your claims that you do are able, willing and available to work, and your job has told us that you rejected work 4 times.

L: Well at my job they know that, I don't know why they're telling lies, they know what the situation is with my son, and that that lady closed the door for me when the pandemic started, I hope that once the schools start she will open her door for me and help me, with the help of God.

Mr. Mountainside Wastes Everyone's Time,"So I work as a Tech Support. Last year I got a caller several times, from the same person. Im gonna call him Mr. Mountainside.


First time I got this guy, I was about 15 mins away from my end of shift (I was a closer). Dude called in about a very specific inquiry. It was done in about 10 minutes, however I was closing the call, he did ask for a favor. Asking me to show his resume. So I view his screen, he showed me a 5 page resume that to be honest kind of looks like a scrapbook. I was like, dude seriously? Why would this guy add a picture of a travel brochure on his resume. I told him honest feedback about it. Then later he shows me the place he was applying for (I think it was a Walmart or something similar). He then askwd me if companies are willing to hire someone whos willing to work 2 hours a day for twice a week. I tell him again most people hire full timers. Then I looked. At the case notes. He is tagged as a something like a Serial Caller. Dude must have called 1,000 times (and probably more) over the span of 2 years.


Sometimes he calls saying his device is frozen but really its just a screenshot he is showing. Agents had multiple escalations to Tier 2 over minor things and funny things. So a few months pass and I get him again. Had basic inquiries, then I told him, hows the job hunt going. He told me he has not had any luck and showed me his resume again. It got worse again. I got hin about 2 more times, and I think tha5 was the end of it.


Now I am working as support. I do live monitoring of our agents from time to time. Then, I noticed his voice right away. I asked my agent, hey, is that Mr. Mountainside? He said yes. Then I told my agent ooo biy, your fked with your handle time. This time it was a very funny concern. Saying there should be a law or a policy that our customers shouldnt use their devices in public because, ""they are showing off"" luckily, my agent manage to stay professional and they did end up having to restart his device which means, call will get disconnected. Did end up wasting 2 hours of my advisors time. And yes, he still is jobless as he asked help again with his resume (which apparently has 3 pages now and looks slightly much better)


Mr Mountainside, if you are a redditor, I hope you read this, fix your crappy resume for real and find a real job, you keep on wasting our time.

They were both traumatized by what happened. I flagged Accident Benefits for their injuries and their trauma, we provide therapists for that.

I had never taken a statement for a pedestrian death before, but I did it, and offered plenty of empathy for our client. I had to take some time off the phone and cuddle one of my cats. 

No funny story from me this time. Just an FYI to not joke about suicide with an auto claims rep, we’ve all heard disturbing stories and have to look at accident scene photos. I had to cuddle another cat.",684,0,0
My supervisor actually heard me beating my head on the desk.,"So this happened ages ago, when I worked in an insurance call center. Our company was contracted as part of the Medicare Part D initial roll out. For those who don't know Medicare Part D covers prescription drugs. 

In the initial roll out there were tons of plans through numerous companies. The customers were supposed to call in to choose a plan or opt out of a plan. If you didn't call in to do one of those things you were automatically assigned a plan. When calling in you'd give us your list of prescriptions, and plans would come up from least expensive to most. For certain low income people a plan was assigned automatically in advance, and these plans would have no monthly bill, and many would have very low or no copays for the prescriptions depending on the scrip.

So I'm rocking along kicking tail and taking names, when SHE calls. 😵😵😵 Cast - DOL=Dumb Old Lady, M=Me, S=Supervisor.

M: Thank you for calling company, this is AdamGreyskul75, how can I assist you today?

DOL: I'm calling for this Part D thing! They signed me up for a plan, and I don't want that plan!

M: Ok ma'am, were you wanting to opt out of the program completely? Or simply choose a different plan?

DOL: I want a different plan! They chose this one and I don't want it!

M: That's fine ma'am. If you'll give me your list of prescriptions I'll help you choose another plan.

DOL: I take D1, D2, and D3.

M: Ok ma'am. I'm showing that they have already signed you up for Super Awesome Plan. There will be no monthly bills and all of your prescriptions will be no charge at any pharmacy that takes Medicare.

DOL: I don't want that plan.

M: Ok ma'am, the next plan would Sorta Good Plan. It would cost you $XX.XX dollars a months and each of your prescriptions would cost you $X per month.

DOL: That's too expensive!

M: Well ma'am the plan you're currently on won't cost you anything at all.

DOL: I don't want that plan!

Wash, rinse, repeat, with each plan getting progressively more expensive. For 1. And a half. HOURS!

M: *head desk -been doing this for the last 30 minutes* Ok ma'am. We have the Totally Wrong For You Plan. It's $XXX a month. D1 would be $XX per month but D2 and D3 aren't covered by this plan at all. 

DOL: THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE!!! Why are all of these plans so expensive?

M: Well ma'am *head desk* the plan You. Are. Currently. On. Would not cost you anything. 

DOL: I DON'T WANT THAT PLAN!

M: *head desk* *head desk* *head desk* Ok ma'am. The next plan is Worst Possible Plan. It would cost $XXX a month and none of your prescriptions would be covered.

DOL: BUT THAT'S TOO EXPENSIVE!!!

M: *HEAD DESK*

DOL: What's that noise? 

M: Must be the connection ma'am. *head desk* Ma'am, the plan you're currently on would not cost you ANY MONEY. AT ALL. 

DOL: But I don't I don't want that plan!

M: Ma'am I don't have any other plans. What is the problem with the plan they assigned you? 

DOL: They assigned it. I didn't pick it.

M: *barely cut off snort of near hysterical laughter*  Ma'am, what is your issue with a plan that costs you nothing and supplies your medications at no cost as well? This is the best possible plan if any pharmacy in your area takes Medicare.

DOL: Well I guess, I'll keep it then. *hangs up*

M: *headdeskheaddeskheadesk*

S: So that's what that noise was.

M: *gives her look promising mass murder*

S: Uhhhhhh, why don't you take a break....

It took me nearly 30 minutes to calm down.

Our average call was 5-10 minutes. That call ALMOST made me quit, but fortunately it was the worst call I ever dealt with by far, and I actually spent several years with the company.

Edit: If you've ever worked in a call center with scripts, that is why I couldn't ask her WHY she didn't like her plan. If they didn't like the plan we helped them pick a new one by taking their info and pulling up available plans. Our scripts didn't allow for it. As it was a government contract, going off script could get me fired, and possibly lose the company the contract. I had zero craps left to give after 1.5 hours and figured I was screwed anyway.

This was also the first call center I had ever worked in, not very far into the contract, maybe someone with more experience could have wrangled something else out of the scripts. I didn't see anything I could use.

Emails were not allowed.

I could not escalate the call unless the customer asked for a manager, or a few other reasons I can't remember, but none of those reasons occured, so I was stuck on the call.",1277,0,0
"Sent here from TIFU after this blew up, accidentally exposed a customer for cheating on his wife","Copy &amp; Pasted from my original post, including updates: 

 

(Names changed for the sake of the post) So this took place maybe half an hour ago, and to be honest there's still a chance there will be some kickback for this today. I (25M) work in a call centre, and am doing so for the duration of this pandemic while I wait to find out whats happening about going back to university, its no career but its a pretty nice job with some decent people and its easy, all we do really is facilitate switches for people looking for better deals on household stuff, usually their internet provider or supplier of gas/electricity etc. We have agents in the field who make sales, then call us for verification with the customer, simple right?

Not today. See, usually its company policy not to do call-backs, nobody wants annoying call-centre calls right? So unless the customer specifically requests a scheduled call-back, we just don't do them. I had a customer 2 days ago looking for a pretty pricey internet switch, going from some basic setup to a full TV/Phone/Internet package, the works, all the channels, anytime calls to numbers including international, 500+ mbps wifi, and it came to over £100 a month. I inform the customer, who's an impatient sounding guy, that because of the price increase he'll need to have a quick credit check run on him and it'll mean the call takes a little longer. The guy gets all pissed about being busy and saying he ""can't waste all afternoon on the phone to some call-centre"" so would it be alright if I called him after the weekend to go through it then. Seemed straightforward enough...

This is pretty common, people are always up for the sale until they realise they'll need to spend more than 1 whole minute on the phone, but I scheduled the call anyway and asked if there was a specific time he wanted me to call, he says any time is fine and follows with ""If Emily answers, just ask her for me, she'll make sure I get the phone"" and gave me a home-phone number. Fast forward to today, and I make a grave error.

See, the application I had from the customer had his home phone number already filled in, which it turns out was NOT the same number he'd given me for today's call back. I called the number I thought was correct, and a woman answers. I say without thinking; ""Oh hi, I'm calling for Steve to confirm his broadband switch, we spoke the other day? You must be Emily!"" .....cue uncomfortable pause. She says ""This is Steve's wife, Amanda. What do you mean I ""must"" be Emily?""

I apologised, and said ""I'm so sorry, when I spoke to him the other day he said if an Emily answered to just ask for Steve?"" And she just goes ""I fucking knew it, I fucking KNEW IT."" and slammed the phone down. After checking the application against the post-it note i'd jotted some info down on the other day, I realised Steve must have given me the number for where he was going to be today, and i'd instead called his unsuspecting wife at home. Nobody's called in to my workplace yet, but if they do I don't think they'll be happy

TL;DR Customer gave me a different number to his own for a call-back, and I accidentally called his wife and revealed his infidelity

UPDATE! Well fUCK, angry Steve just called my workplace, and has achieved nothing but making himself look like an ever bigger fucking dipshit than he already has, also for the record, Steve was always a dick who can die in a hole, and deserves all he gets, the reason for the TIFU was because I was worried about my job) So I haven't worked here very long, and am still learning things about company policy, and it turns out that when an application is put through by an agent, it MUST be the applicants own details, according to what they provide the agent. So I was only technically allowed to call the wife anyway, not Emily's home number as he gave me. If he'd wanted the call to a different number, he would have had to have a new application submitted with revised details, it wasn't enough to just give me a different number over the phone, so my job is safe (phew) however my manager isn't happy and i'm getting a write-up, but I can live with that, they don't mean much and i've never had one til now, always on time and have taken overtime voluntarily etc. ANYWAY, this guy phones up and before saying anything else, leads the call with one of my colleagues, who by the way, is a teenage girl in what I think is her first job, and he says ""Put me on with the little f\*cking c\*nt who thought it would be funny to call my wife earlier after I EXPLICITLY told him not too""

Obviously the poor girl was confused, and looked about to ask the room for a manager asap, I immediately piped up and said ""Is it Mr X from \*insert location\*??"" and she confirmed, so I got her to transfer the call to my desk ASAP, Steve comes on the line and goes ""I bet you think you're well f\*cking funny you little pr\*ck, put your manager on the phone and see if you're so smart when you lose your job"" So in my most sarcastic, overcompensating cutesy phone voice ever, I just say ""Of course sir, let me just transfer you to someone who can help"" then put him on hold for 20 minutes hoping it would wind him up even more while I found my manager and told him about the whole situation, he explained what i'd said above that I wasn't technically in the wrong from a legal standpoint, and then my poor team leader had to quickly explain to Steve that he didn't have a legal claim but that we're sorry for the distress caused (sucky I know, but its a business after all) and now hopefully Steve's evening culminates in his entire life being ruined. I got a disciplinary write-up for it but its over now, sorry for the wall of text but thanks for the awards!

UPDATE 2: For those wondering about the disciplinary, it was a formality and was the lowest possible level write-up my company can give, it was given as a formality because of disruption to the office (the girl Steve called was upset and it became a whole thing) He argued that I still made a mistake but that ultimately I am in no trouble over it, he also cited on the write up that leaving him on hold for so long just to wind him up was spiteful and petty, which, yeah, but Steve deserved it so it be like that",396,0,0
“But I want the water pick!!”,"Some background I work for a company that provides extra benefits to plans that are either Medicare or Medicaid recipients. Most of my callers are Medicare. And if that doesn’t tell you the type of calls I get on a daily I don’t know what will. 

M = me 
DF = dumb fuck 

Me: thank you for calling asshole company my name is apples who do I have the *pleasure* of speaking with?

DF: mr. dumb fuck I want to order the water pick

Me: alright sir can you verify your information *asks questions to verify account*

DF: *begrudgingly gives me the info while sighing into the phone* (I’m sorry that protecting your information is sooooo much of an inconvenience sir truly.)

Me: alright you have 20 credits to spend, you can place one order a quarter, and anything you do not use WILL NOT ROLL OVER (this will be important later)

DF: yeah yeah yeah. I want the water pick.

Me: *looks up item* I’m very sorry sir (not) but the water pick is 45 credits. You only have 20. 

DF: well can I pay the difference 

Me: unfortunately sir due to the nature of the benefit, we are unable to take credit card payments. All transactions have to be with the credits your plan provides.

DF: well can I still get the water pick.

Me: no sir. You don’t have enough credits.

DF: but I want the water pick

Me: I’m sorry sir but you cannot spend more than your credits allow. 

DF: well will it roll over? Can I get it next quarter?

Me: no. If you don’t use it the 20 dollars will disappear. You will lose it if you do not use it. 

DF: so it doesn’t roll over?

Me: yes sir it doesn’t roll over. 

DF: then how can I get the water pick?

Me: well you can petition your plan for more credits, or get a new plan for 2021 that offers more credits. 

DF: but what about now? I need this water pick! 

Me: unfortunately sir, there’s nothing we can do at this time for you to get the water pick. 

DF: but how will I get one? 

Idk sir maybe do what everyone else does and go to the store and buy one? 

Me: if your physician recommends you need one immediately I would recommend going to Walgreens or CVS to purchase one, as at this time you DO NOT have enough credits to buy it. 

DF: well what’s the whole point of the credit there’s nothing in the magazine for 20 dollars. 

Me: *pulling up the catalog* actually sir we have 100s of items all for under 20 credits. Most as low as 5 credits. *begins listing off examples*

DF: but I don’t want that I WANT the water pick.

Me: well I’m sorry but you do not have enough credits to get the water pick. We do have regular floss if you would like. 

DF: no. This is stupid. Do you have any diabetic socks.

Me: yes we have two types *describes them*

DF: which one do you recommend

Me a 24 year old: well this pair has more socks in it. I haven’t heard any complaints. 

DF: well?!?

Me: what size shoe do you wear

DF: idk. I want the water pick.

Me: I’m sorry sir but again you don’t have enough for the water pick. You stated you want diabetic socks. What size shoe do you wear.

It’s at this point his harpy of a wife snatches the phone 

MDF: WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE CANT GET THE WATER PICK

Me: I’m sorry who is this? 

MDF: Mrs. Dumb Fuck!! Now answer my question!!

Me: I’m sorry but I cannot discuss member information without permission from the member. 

MDF: HES RIGHT FUCKING HERE WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU JUST SPOKE TO HIM

Me: and he did not say that I could speak to you. I need permission from him to talk to you. 

MDF: dumb fuck give this bitch permission so she can answer my fucking question 

DF: you can talk to her she’s my wife *grumbling*

Me: *explains to the wife what I said to the husband*

MDF: I don’t understand does it roll over!?! 

Me: No it doesn’t.

MDF: so in October he can get it right?

Me: NO

MDF: well what’s the point in having this plan if YOU PEOPLE don’t cover anything!

Me: well Mrs. dumb fuck, we cover a multiple of items. It just so happens that he chose one of the few items that his 30 dollar credit doesn’t offer. If he needs a water pick immediately I recommend going to the store and purchasing one 

MDF: well can we buy more credits

Me: *head desk* no you can’t buy more credits. That’s not how this works.

MDF: well if we order from the catalog can we get it then?!?

Me: no. The catalog only provides a written inventory of what items are offered through the plan. It doesn’t allow you to buy anything without using credits.

MDF: then cancel the plan!

Me: you will have to contact your member services in order to cancel your plan. This is Xxx department. 

MDF: I WANT YOU TO CANCEL IT

Me: I do not have the ability to cancel the plan. Now your husband stated that he wanted diabetic socks. If he would still like that item I will need his shoe size.

MDF: we don’t want any of your fucking products we want the water pick.

Me: then unfortunately there’s nothing else we can do here Mrs. dumb fuck. Unless you’re wanting to place an order for the diabetic socks.

MDF: *screeching about the water pick with husband in the background*

Me: I’m sorry for the inconvenience but unless there’s anything else you’d like I hope you both have a GREAT day. 

MDF: you didn’t help us we want the water pick!

Me: I’m sorry ma’am but it is impossible for me to give you enough credits for the water pick. Now if is that everything you need?

MDF: I’m calling corporate! 

Me: alright ma’am that’s fine. I hope you have a wonderful day

Call from “The chairman”,"Obligatory “on mobile”.
TL:DR at bottom

So I work in collections where most of my day consists of hang ups and people repeating “how can I help you” like they’re stuck in a time loop when asked to verify anything.

Anyway. The other day I had a very interesting incoming call. So this guy calls in, we’ll call him “Stan”.

So Stan calls because he received a notice in the mail that didn’t match his personal records. He proceeded to explain to me how he was the chairman of some medical fund related to this particular hospital so he has records of what his bill should be. So I walk him through what I can with the very limited info that I have. But he’s asking for details that I can’t answer, since I don’t have access to his medical records.

So I’m feeling in over my head with Stan, so I tell him I’m going to grab a supervisor. So I message my supervisor (working from home due To COVID, so we use an instant messenger) and she jumps into the call. Let’s call her “Carol”

So Carol gets on and does her verification and what not, and I go on mute. So Stan goes into his thing. And he continues.

And continues.

After 10 minutes of Stan telling us, in more detail than anyone would ever need, about this fund that he’s the Chairman of, I start messaging Carol while she’s trying to talk to Stan. It starts off simple like “OMG I cant believe this guy” Seriously it’s like he thought we might forget he’s the chairman. Carol couldn’t even talk to him. She couldn’t get a word in. At about 12 minutes I just get up and get an ice cream sandwich from the kitchen.  When I get back, sure enough, Stan is still at it. I start messaging Carol about if I have time to run to the Arby’s by my house. She’s like “get me some curly fries”.

Anyway after about 20 minutes Carol FINALLY figured out what had happened and solved it, and it still took another 2 minutes of listening to Stan the chairman before we finally hung up. As soon as we were sure he was off, the two of us burst out laughing about this guy and the fact that he was clearly compensating for something by mentioning this fund he’s the chairman of.  Anyway that’s my story.

TL:DR
Guy calls me talks about being he chairman of some hospital fund, and takes 20 minutes to solve a very simple problem. Boss and I laugh about it.",23,0,0
The Most Frustrating Customer Service Call I Can Remember,"The outrageously difficult calls are... Just when you think that they can't be topped, they are. This is a bit long, but I hope it entertains you and makes you feel better about whatever calls you've fielded today.

This was the early 2000s. The internet was just really starting to get off the ground for job searches in non-technical fields. Walking into a place and being told to apply on their website was almost unheard of. It wasn't the essential thing that it is now.

At the time, I worked in the billing department for a major ISP. (For reference, I've been a general operator, directory assistance, international directory assistance, billing, *and* internal tech support at various times in my career. That's in chronological order.) We covered about 80-90% of the US. The call came, as these are wont to do, right before the end of my shift. The customer had called in to try to get her DSL reconnected, and her account was seriously in arrears. 

The conversation went roughly like this...

Her: I want my internet back on.

Me: (ten minutes trying to get enough info to verify WHOSE account just popped up on my screen)

Me: Well, your current balance is X. If you make a payment now....

Her: I can't make a payment. I want my internet back on.

Me: I'm sorry, ma'am. At the present time, you'd have to pay X to reactivate your service.

Her: I have stuff showing I paid....

Me: I'm sorry to hear there's a miscommunication. You can fax those records over to us and we can get it sorted out.

Her: I can't do that. I don't have the money to pay for it.

This was repeated, with further variation, for close to an hour. I am not sure if she was drunk, but she was slurring as she spoke and sometimes acting like I hadn't told her something I already had. Alzheimer's might be an explanation? I was also getting the full dissertation on her home life, how many relatives used her internet (enough to fill a moderately sized stadium) which had been shut off for over two months at this point, and how we should - again - turn it back on without her paying us. 

And, unlike when I worked in Operator Services, I was *not* allowed to hang up if the customer was unwilling to establish a valid billing method. 

I was starting to think that she thought internet service was a one-time payment. Not an entirely unreasonable thought pattern. There were email services that allowed you to dial into their servers for free in exchange for plastering banner ads over their software. Juno actually had a service with a small amount of actual free internet as recently as the mid-2010s.

At this point, there were just two people in the (rather large) room. The current supervisor on the floor walked over to find out why I hadn't left, as I was on the end of day shift and was still there an hour after HE should have been able to go home. If I had to guess, since this particular supervisor hadn't had direct contact with me and hadn't monitored my performance previously, he thought the duration was somehow my fault.

I felt for him. I knew he was tired. So was I. I also had needed to visit the ladies' room for the better part of thirty minutes, so his intervention was - to me - akin to a paladin on horseback with full bardic fanfare playing behind him.

The customer was still ranting in my ear, but - after some muting to hold a conversation with him - he decided to take the call and told me to go home. I had enough experience in call centers that I seldom, if ever, had to pass along a ""sup call."" I had never been so grateful to do so.

I happily informed the woman that my supervisor would like to speak with her. We traded off and I collected my things and went to go clock out. 

I double-timed it to the clock, but wanted to just enjoy breathing for a minute. I stopped by the restroom, got a soda from the vending machine, and then strolled slowly toward the exit while fishing my keys out of my purse. I was also hoping, as we weren't in the best part of town, that this would also get me an escort to my car. Surely, if I was slow enough, he'd be off the phone, right? 

It must have taken me roughly ten to fifteen minutes.

As I left, I had to pass by my cubicle. I could see him banging his head on the desk. He looked up at me after a second with a yearning for freedom that said he had entered at least the fifth level of hell the hard way: by slowly making his way through purgatory and the four floors above on a demonstratively thorough and interactive tour.

The next day, he stops me in a hallway to tell me how it went. The call, apparently, went on for a further hour and a half. He wasn't even sure how he'd managed to finally get her off the line. He did say that he was pretty sure my sup calls - if all of the few that I'd had were like that - had to be record breaking.",39,0,0
When you know more about internal group chat program than your manager. (Wholesome story),"Hey! Big Momma here with another callcenter story. 

So we had this program that was used for internal comunication and each team had their own groupchat for seeking help, updates and bits of teambuilding fun. I have created and was managing another (kind of illegal) group chat for my friends called “The Fun Club” where we hanged out and shitposted durring our calls. 

When we changed teams (every 3 months) I was ofcourse boored one time and sniffing around the settings our manager set into our new team group chat. I was supper happy when I found out he did not locked chat edits for non-admins. Ofcourse I had to mess with it somehow, but was trying to figure out how, in order not to be too disruptive and get in trouble. 

The group chats had “description” that was displayed alongside the channel name and also as a message in the chat when you opened the program. That was my target. 

Since then, every single day, when I came to work, I edited the channel description with a “joke of a day”. They were not super funny as I had to keep it safe for work and short. Most of them were just silly dad jokes and puns. 

Joke of the day #7
I bought new shoes from my dealer today. I don’t know what he laced them with, but I’ve been trippin all day. 

Joke of the day #8
Do you know how holy water is made? They boil the hell out of it!

And so on. I always got a few smiley faces in the chat or occasional “Hey have you seen todays joke? Its good!” 

I was doing this for almost 3 months before I left the company. What was the best part about this you ask? Well, NOBODY KNEW! I was posting these and pretending to laugh at the jokes alongside my coworkers (Except my best friend but she was happy to keep it a secret) 

My manager didn’t know who was posting them but liked them as well, some of my colleagues thought he was messing with them and that he was the one posting. Some people even thought it was some automatic function of the program. I can’t stress enough how much I enjoyed being behind this huge mystery that none could solve for several months. I admited to it in the end and people were sad that there will be no more jokes once I leave. 

That’s it, thanks for reading and have a great day!

Your 10 year old grandson drank every bottle of your wine and is fine??,"Another tale from a wine club call center.  

Me: Thank you for calling, this is Me, how can I help you?

Crazy lady: Hi, yeah, I have a problem with my order.  This is so embarrassing but my 10 year old grandson was home yesterday when my wine got delivered, and opened all the bottles and drank them.  I found all the empty bottle stashed in the bathroom”

Me: What?? Omg is he okay? Is he in the hospital?

Crazy Lady: he’s okay, although his parents are pissed and say he can’t come over anymore.  Anyway, my point in calling is that the delivery company gave the wine to a 10 year old and it’s all gone so I need a new case, for free, since they should have asked for an ID and my grandson is clearly not 21.

Me: Ooookay, let me talk to my supervisor about how to handle this...

I escalated the call to my supervisor, and they ended up sending her a new case just to not deal with it.  Which, whatever, it was clearly a scam but sometimes it’s easier to just get them out of your hair.

The kicker? This lady called AGAIN a week later saying her wine never got delivered this time and she needed another replacement...

"No sir, you can’t have my personal information to send me a farewell card...","I used to work at a call center for a wine club delivery service.  As people love their wine, I had about 10 regulars who only wanted to talk to me when placing their orders because I knew a lot about the wines we offered and made some good suggestions they enjoyed.  Honestly I mostly read descriptions off the internet but they loved thinking they were special I think.

I worked there for 2 ish years and for the most part it was a good job, if not stressful.

Anyway after I left one of my coworkers called me to tell me that a gentleman who was one of my regulars insisted upon getting my home address and last name in order to send me a card to bid me farewell.  Now, I am a very friendly person on the phone, but I don’t know you, Jerry from Vermont, I wouldn’t have any idea who you were without your file open in front of me.  Of course you can’t have my last name and address...

Guy gets confused on why his internet is out after a huricane.,"This is another story from my CallCenter chronicles, hope you enjoy.

This happened few years ago when I was working as a tech support agent for a big American telecomunication company. The call came in right after a big huricane and not all affected accounts were marked yet so I did not know right away he was part of the outage.

""Hi, blah blah blah, How may I help you today?""

Older gentleman on the phone: ""Can you hear this?""

""No John (fake name ofc), I'm affraid I can't. What am I listening for?""

""Its my generator! The entire city is flooded after the huricane but I was prepared and took my generator to a 2nd floor so now I have electricity.""

""I'm so sorry to hear about the huricane, must have been horrible, but good on you for being prepared!""

""Thanks! Soooo, anyway. My internet and TV stopped working. Can you help me with that?""

""John, I'm affraid that if the huricane was as bad as you told me, there will be damaged infrastructure and many outages in your area. I am looking at your account as we speak and I indeed do not see any signal going to your premises.""

""Oh cmon! It was't that bad! Maybe it's showing wrong on your end. Can I check here if I have signal?""

""John I'm sorry but our tools generally do not lie but if you want to check for youself, just look at your modem and you will see a red light under broadband that indicates no signal comming through""

""Well, see, I can't really do that. The internet box is downstairs under water""

""Well, you kinda need that box among other things for your services to be up and running""

""Oh, I see. So there is really nothing we can do?""

""At this point, we just need to wait for our disaster response teams to fix everything. You can get updates on the progress here, here here, blah blah blah""

Caller asks inappropriate question and doesn't expect my answer,"When I was 17 (sigh....39 years ago, damn I'm fucking old) I worked for National Data Corporation at their call center over off North Druid Hills in Atlanta Georgia.

We took calls for everything:  Slim Whitman Album - sure let met take your order.  Whatever Crazy product advertised on TV at this moment - sure let me take your order.  We even handled bank deposit information for large corporations, as well as running credit card authorizations for vendors when they had to call in for authorization on a credit card.  We also took lost/stolen credit card reports.

So you get it, was a ton of different things people could be calling in for.  Since I was 17 I usually worked hours like 3pm-8pm a few days a week.  I graduated school early (December) so I was then able to pick up late shifts and more full time hours and make some righteous money.

One night I'm working late, it's probably 11pm and the phone rings, I answer it.

It was about a 10 minute survey, &amp; we had about 20 more minutes to make our quota for the time zone we were calling. I got a guy on the phone &amp; after he agreed to do the survey, I began asking the questions. They were fairly innocent, like ""What do you consider a romantic date? A) a movie B) a walk in the park..."" &amp; so on, mainly about romance. About halfway through, I hear a click. I thought he had hung up, but he answered the question. All of a sudden, I hear ""Who the hell is this? Is this Stacy?! I told you to leave us alone!!"" I tried to explain who I was, &amp; she started yelling ""Stacy, you are such a bitch!!

Jon: Ahh, okay it was my wife that set this all up, the name is Stace Nameson.

Me: Okay I still can't disclose what I have on file here as your name doesn't match, but that's okay. Is Stace around today? If you could pop her on the phone I can ask some security questions with here and get all cleared to discuss anything you like?

How not to re number a customers phone.,"So I had a customer call in. They said that they had just gotten their daughter a phone on our network  and when they tried to text their daughter, the texts went to someone else. She spoke to that person who said that they had been wirh us before but switched to another company and kept the number. So I check with one of my L2s. They determine it was an error on our system that the number didn’t get removed from the available number pool, and tell me to go ahead and renumber the phone, and waive the fee for it. 

Simple enough, right? Hahaha, wrong. I follow policy and select the nearest store to pick a number. I tell them the number. They don’t want it. They want a very specific area code and exchange code. I go through the whole list of stores to check. Have some close ones but not the right one. Nope. They give me another number. Go back through the list. Some more close ones. Nope. By this point the call is nearing an hour, most of it spent trying to find the number they want. 

It gets better. By the time I go through the list again, they finally decide they’ll take the very first number I gave them. I prepare myself for more torture when I ask them first what digit of the last 4 they want it to start with, 0-9. Thankfully, and I think they were tired too, they said it didn’t matter. So I was able to select a random one and give it to them. The call took almost an hour and 20 minutes to do.... all because they wanted to be picky. My L2 had even told me that if they didn’t like the similar numbers, well tough shit, they were gonna be stuck with the original number I offered.",562,0,0

So the girls in my team who I sat with on every shift decided to take it up  a level and start a little competition.  Who could keep him on the phone the longest.

Can you read?,"A little background. I work for a mortgage servicing company. We are middle man contracted by banks and mostly take payments on homeowner's mortgages. A bank can legally change your mortgage servicer at any time during the your loan, so the company you pay your bill to can change. So there is a company we will call Company X and they sent out notices to homeowner's that their servicing changes effective September 1, 2020 and any payments made prior to September 1, 2020 need to be made to company X and and payments made on September 1, 2020 or after need to be made to the company I work for, we will call it company Y. The notice states if they want to contact their new servicer (company Y) they can contact us starting on September 1, 2020. When they call in to us (company Y) there is a recording explaining that if your servicing is transferring effective September 1, 2020 then your mortgage will not be able to be serviced until at least September 1, 2020 and may take up until September 8, 2020 for us to have an account set up for you. I have been getting calls for over a week now with homeowners freaking out that we cant give them any of their account info or service their mortgage yet. I even ask them "" what date does it say the date of transfer of service is on the notice?"" and the caller will say something like ""it says it is effective September 1, 2020 and I can contact you with questions starting September 1, 2020 but why cant you help me now???"". I just sit there rolling my eyes. Ive been yelled at, called names and hung up on simply because these ppl cant grasp the concept. ""What's my new account number? Can I make a payment to you now? When is my payment due?"" I just say , "" if it says on your notice that your servicing is effective September 1, 2020 then contact us on September 1, 2020, any sooner and we won't be able to assist you.""

Caller: Thanks for the help. I have to ask, why was I not notified about the status of my membership?

Me: I'm sorry what do you mean about that? I thought you were notified. Isn't that why you called?

Caller: I was emailed yes, but why wasn't I called?

Me: We don't generally call people to notify them of missed payments, we send emails like the one you received.

Caller: That's not right, you should be calling people to notify them. I got my email several days ago and I didn't notice because it was in my junk folder. What kind of company are you running?

Me: I apologize sir but it's not really our fault that you didn't check your email. If our email went into your junk folder you may want look at the filters you have in place since they may be sorting your email wrong.

Caller: That's not right, phone calls are much more professional. I'm going to be writing a letter of complaint about your company and sending it to [Name of local business regulation board] as well as [Names of various news organizations] and telling them about this awful way you conduct business.

Man calls asking about woman's clothing line and co-workers consider him a crank call....he wasn't a crank at all,"This is from seven years ago when I worked at a call center for a woman’s clothing manufacturer. I worked the 5pm to 2am shift. Now the manufacturer owns multiple brands, so we’d receive a notification on the phone and computer as to which company to answer as depending on the phone number that the customer called.

There was this one gentleman that had been calling on our high end clothing company phone number daily for like a week and at a certain point the call handler would determine it was a crank call and hang up.

It’s about midnight one night and I am the lucky one to get his call. This is roughly how the call went

Me: Thank you for calling (company) this is Kaideleigh, how may I assist you?

Caller: Hi, can you tell me about Skirt #1234 on page 5 of this month’s magazine?

Me: Sure, let me pull it up online…..ok, I have it online, what can I answer for you.

Caller: … silence … how long is the skirt?

Me: It is (however many) inches long.

Caller: How does the material feel? Is it soft, coarse?

Me: Well, if you don’t mind holding, we have a boutique here in the call center and I can run over to see if we have this skirt in stock and bring back to my desk to answer your questions.

Caller: Sure!

A few minutes go by, I find the skirt and go back to my desk and let the caller know I’m back with the skirt.

Me: Ok sir, I have the skirt in hand. The material is (whatever it was) and it feels very soft and smooth. Doesn’t feel like it would itch on the skin and the inside seams are smoothed out and very soft, shouldn’t irritate skin at all. PLUS the inside tag is actually printed on the material and not sewn on, so it won’t itch or irritate.

Caller: … silence ... silence... Silence…..

Me: Sir:

Caller: You… didn’t hang up on me.

Me: No sir, you’re a customer and it’s my job to answer your questions.

The customer then went on to say that he liked to dress in women’s clothing but was too embarrassed to go out in public to purchase the items, so he’d resorted to calling us. He said he’d been calling nightly for a week to try and place an order and that I was the first person that didn’t make him feel awkward or anything.

We chatted for a bit – the company I worked for did not have any metrics as to how long you could be on a call, I took a call that lasted 4 hours once. ANYWAY, he ended up ordering that skirt in 2 different sizes so he could return the one that didn’t fit, etc.  He bought several other items from me that night.

Two Different Insurance Companies = Two Different Center Attitudes,"I would love to hear about how other call center's training programs are from the front line workers. Don't need names/company sensitive info - just curious. My experiences are below...

The first call center I worked for was wonderful - 8 weeks of in-class training (they assumed anyone coming in had NO clue how insurance worked, but were more than happy to teach); two weeks in-class customer calls with a trainer, your floor manager (whose team you will become) and an authorizations supervisor (I believe this was more for legal reasons than not). Once you were on the floor - the first two months you had a trainer or a floor ""coach"" as well as your floor manager constantly walking the floor and available if you got stuck or got a nasty caller. Then the ""coach"" went away, but the floor manager always had your back. Made a mistake during those first few months? = ""Growing Pains"" as you were part of the ""newbie"" class that just took the floor. The floor managers expected mistakes and helped get you through them in order to make you better. Until you hit your ""first year mark"" - unless you made dumb mistakes on every call - you had all the backup you could want. And that didn't change AFTER the one year mark, but you were expected to know the system and the software well enough to not need ""hand holding."" I sincerely wish every new call center trainee had this incredible team.

The second call center? An absolute disaster. Two week crash course on their software, more time spent on what NOT to do than info on what your product actually was and then you were dumped onto the floor and basically told ""sink or swim, we can replace you."" Six months probation; watch your QA scores, watch your metrics, DO NOT go off script for any reason. Have enough experience to let a struggling customer know something that doesn't pertain specifically to their plan/program? - you WILL be written up if you volunteer that information. And for the love of all that's holy - don't EVER EVER mention the dreaded Master Elderly Citizen program (\*nod and smile if you know which one I mean\*). That could get you another write-up or even fired. Didn't meet your metrics three months in a row = FIRED. QA scores tanked (anything under 70 average out of 20 calls pulled at random) for more than 3 months in a row = let's get security to walk you to the entrance.

You may be asking, why did I ever leave the first call center? After transitioning from Medical Coding/Billing to Medical Call (the dept downsized) I was really nervous, as I'd never done anything like call center work. By the time the company starting asking for volunteers to transfer to the Pharmacy Call Dept - I had been there for a little over two years and actually enjoyed it. The transition to Pharmacy was what killed me. Not the calls - though they could be really challenging sometimes. It was the New Manager our team was given six months into our tenure on the floor.

But she, my comrades, may be a story for another time.

My most judgmental customer...,"This happened over 6 years ago when I was working for an online clothing store. Reading the stories in this sub reminds me of my time there and I wanted to share a bizarre/terrible customer experience. 

I had been working there for about 3 years at this point and had handed in my notice to leave. One day, I received a call from a member who wanted to complain about an item advertised on the site. I asked for account details etc and looked for the item she had saved to her cart. While searching, she kept shouting random words like “disgusting”and “horrible” while I typed away silently.

Once I had found the item, I was eager to see what could cause such an extreme reaction to a clothing item as we had received complaints regarding “inappropriate” items before. The item in question was a pair of leather pants (women’s dept). Once I had pulled it up, I asked the woman what exactly the issue was and this is where it all went downhill. 

Apparently, the lighting in the photograph created a shadow on the crotch of the pants that looked like the model may have a penis. The woman on the phone continued to scream about how the item needs to be removed immediately as children might see it. While I explained that the shape was more than likely caused by lighting and that this woman probably did not have a penis that even if she did, it wouldn’t warrant taking down the photograph. 

This lady freaked out and roared in what I can only describe as a demonic voice “I don’t want to see creatures like that when I’m trying to shop.” Once I had argued back and forth for a while I realized that I was leaving in a few days and that I couldn’t reason with a person like this. I proceeded to tell her that she was a disgusting creature and that she must have a sad life to be so full of hate, hung up and deleted her account. This was the only time I ever spoke to a customer that way but it was also the most ridiculous complaint I had ever received. Luckily there was no consequences with management at the time but it wouldn’t have mattered too much anyway.

I have moved on the another job but still deal with customers in a different capacity. Whenever I get frustrated with someone I remind myself that I’m lucky that I’m not speaking to someone as rude as that lady.",45,0,0
I tell a pervert how to zoom in on cleavage so he doesn't have to call in to jerk off over the phone to us,"This is from seven years ago when I worked at a call center for a woman’s clothing manufacturer. I worked the 5pm to 2am shift. Now the manufacturer owns multiple brands, so we’d receive a notification on the phone and computer as to which company to answer as depending on the phone number that the customer called.

It’s 1am and I get this call, and it’s for our lingerie company.

Me: Thank you for calling (company), this is Kaideleigh, how many I help you?

Male Caller: Hi, I’d like to ask about the bra on the cover of company website

Me: Ok, give me one second to pull it up on the screen. Ok sir, what is your question

Male Caller: (heavy breathing) Can you describe the bra to me

Me: (having a feeling where this is going and dreading it) Well it is our (slimming brand) of bra, is cut to showcase cleavage but also to have support and be comfortable, blah blah blah.

Male Caller: tell me how it fits on the model, how low cut it is…

Me: (without missing a beat)  Well sir, if you hover your mouse over the image, you can zoom in and see a lot more detail that I can do justice describing.

Male Caller: pause, very heaving breathing and I swear I could hear him, um, (cough) doing something…. and then an excited OH MY GOD THANK YOU

(click) customer hangs up

I then hear my manager break out in hysterical laughter. Turns out she was monitoring my calls that night. She came over to my desk and removed me from queue to tell me that the guy I’d talked to was one of their regular male callers that liked to have bras and panties described to him. She said she should write me up for what I told him but that she thought it was so damn funny she would let it go.

About a month later she asks me if I remember that call and I’m like “how the hell could I forget some guy jacking off while I describe women’s clothing to him”. She said since that night he hadn’t called back and they figured he was enjoying (pun intended) the zoom option on the website

"You're not wrong, but you don't have to be rude and condescending","Customer came in needing help with her phone accessory. We were able to determine that both her phone and spouse's phones and multiple headphones are malfunctioning — all under my company's brand. Honestly I think they're just shit with how they use their devices though.

I offered a reservation to one of our stores, advised her to bring both phones and all headphones that are malfunctioning so it can be checked. This is where her condescending bitchiness comes in; she had valid questions but just **had** to be an ass about it.

M: *offers reservation and store information*  

C: Seriously? That seems very unresponsible and unsafe. There is a pandemic going on and you want me to go outside?

M: Our stores are following strict health and safety protocols. No mask, no entry policy. If you have a mask on, we'll even give you one more free mask so you have a spare. Temperatures are checked and social distancing is enforced. Everything is sanitized properly.  

C: Even still, aren't you supposed to have exceptions with what's going on? Is there any way I can just send my phone for repair?  

M: We do have exceptions with processes, some countries have options they normally don't so we can accommodate them. I checked for your country but the mail-in option is only for ordering phone cases or have them replaced.

C: That's absurd. So you don't have a policy exception for immunocompromised Canadians like me?  

M: *repeat everything I just told her earlier*  

C: So (mycompany) discriminates and values the life of non-immunocompromised Canadians over immunocompromised Canadians?  

M: False, that is not our intent. The safety protocols are for everyone's sake. We also wouldn't be allowed to operate by the government if we weren't in line with standards.

C: Lack of intent doesn't change the fact you're not able to accommodate. 

M: You are speaking with tech support. If you'd like to continue with this feedback, here is where you can deliver your concern through the proper channel: *website*  

C: Unbelievable, so do I need a reservation?  

M: *explain process and give her our store locator webpage*  

C: You do realize this doesn't show anything about my country, right?  

M: Actually, you could click ""all locations"" and select your country from the dropdown.  

C: I see here on your website that mail-in is an option for phones. So why did you tell me this isn't an option? How about that?

M: We were discussing headphones issue earlier so I only provided relevant information that had to do with the topic. That option is only for phones strictly, like a broken display that needs repaired or a phone that wouldn't respond to anything. Besides, we have yet to determine if it's your phones or headphones that are malfunctioning or both, which is why I recommend bringing it all to a technician. A physical inspection must be done to ensure what's causing the issue. I'm not setting up a repair shipping for your phone when we're not even sure yet if that's the issue. (At this point I've had enough of her condescending ass that if she pushed with the shipping I'd have just done it and have her waste money because malicious compliance.)

C: *medium-length rant about how our COVID-response sucks, all positioned to lure me into a debate*

M: You have interesting points, but this is tech support and not the proper channel. *feedback webpage and corporate email address* Is there anything else I can do for you with regards to your device and accessories concern?

C: No. (Bitch didn't even say thanks.)

M: If you have no further concerns, I'll end the chat now.",383,0,0
Mom calls with kid in the room,"Long enough ago I was supporting consumer software in a call center that handled several companies, many of which no longer are even memories.

I think my company is slowly imploding.,"Earlier in the year, before we were sent home for covid, we were training on a new system. In my opinion the new system is trash, we were asked to give input and overwhelmingly everyone said it sucked.

""You'll get used to it. It'll speed up the more you use it. It's the same as the old one, you just have a few extra steps."" 
So about a month into them sending us home (about middle of March) they decided to roll out the new system.
To this day it's still slow as crap, and crashes whenever it pleases. They also decided to tie this new system onto the website, which also slows it down, and is the reason a lot of customers are complaining. Most of the calls I got yesterday were in reference to this new system. 

For some reason it doesn't give tracking information, either it sends them a email with a link that takes them nowhere, or they don't get an email at all. 

It doesn't notify them of backorders, when it's supposed to either say it on the site, or send an email stating that their order is on b/o.

You can't even complete an order online most of the time cause it'll glitch out and add way too many to your cart, or as soon as you put in your cc information and try to checkout it gives you a blank screen.

But we're supposed to sit here and take all of this abuse, because they can't fix their system. I have customers yelling and complaining to me about something I can't fix. 
No sir I don't know why the system didn't email you notifying you that the part you ordered a month ago is on b/o until October.
 
No ma'am I don't know when the order you placed two weeks ago is going to ship, the system doesn't give me an ETA. 

Yes sir, I understand you want to cancel your order, but because it's in ""picked"" status I can't cancel it. What? It's been in that status for how long?

Yes I understand that we're the manufacturer, but that item is on b/o because we have nothing in stock to ship out. No I don't know where it's being made or where it's coming from.

It's frustrating! 
Then our supervisors send out emails happy that things are on b/o cause that means we selling...

Omg covid everywhere be safe! You're wearing a mask? I don't feel safe!,"Sorry for the length. 

I've posted before how my job only provided 3 disposable masks for office staff in the beginning and the office staff has to provide their own cleaners and handsanitizers. Let's rewind to 2 days ago. 

I finally am able to purchase masks and begin wearing them.  I'm sat 4ft or less from a ""old timer"" Co- worker.  She used to be my old supervisor. She's also the ad nauseum Karen of covid information as long as it doesn't relate to how she does and behaves.  She's morbidly obese,  diabetic and has high blood pressure. She has wiped her area repeatedly with dollar store cleaner.  But talks incessantly outward facing from her cubicle about anything and everything for hours without having completed her work and walks like t-rex when passing my cubicle  I would attach a picture but I'm not sure how to.  I'll make it my profile photo how close we are.  

1st day I wore a mask (2 days ago)  was threatened by our oil dispatcher that she'd kick me down the fucking stairs for making her nervous.  To calm her,  I explained why I had chosen to wear a mask because I'm so close to old supervisor.  She didn't have to worry but I had recently read how covid travels through speech and I'm protecting myself. 
She told old supervisor and old supervision went person to person asking if she had coughed or anything. Then called me ""fucking crazy"".

I survived that day.  The next morning I told my boyfriend I was shaking and didn't want to go to work. I said I'm wearing my mask anyway.  

Everyone was cold. But I was able to do my work, for the first 5 hrs.  Only 1 question if I was sick and that's the reason for the mask. Which I said I'm not sick I feel safer. All the ladies in the office,  waited 5 hrs until the owner left the building and then had their chosen bitch corner me in my cubicle. Verbally attack me for more than half an hour.  My supervisor joined in stating ""I come here not wearing a mask because I trust everyone else is doing what they're supposed to, I know you're feeling ganged up on (at which I pointed to the 4 other women surrounding me, while still sat in my cubicle) the whole time I've stated I'm not sick and why I feel safe wearing a mask.

Supervision: ""In these times we can't be too careful,  if you're wearing a mask we can't trust what you do and where you've been. You might be sick"" 

At which their chosen gargoyle stated,  I'm around kids I have a right to know what you do and my risk. What can you do to make me feel safer.  

I packed my shit and left.  Mind you old supervisor had already hidden an exposure and only waited for test results and said she wasn't feeling well,  got a negative and came back to work without Everyone being informed and dispatcher got tested bc she ""felt like it"" with her boyfriend. And never quarantined either 

I clearly stated because of that,  how they lied that another supervisor took a 2wk vacation (quarantined)  and no one is protecting me.  I'm protecting myself. I have an audio witness to the whole 2 days. I stayed in a Bluetooth call and NY is a 1 party state. 

Got a call the next day from the one threatening to kick me down the stairs telling me to come back because I need the money.

"""So, you see, my ex-husband is crazy""","&gt;Disclaimer: On mobile and just discovered this sub♡&lt;


Hi! I've been working for a call center for about a month and we recently started taking real calls, both in english and spanish.

And it makes me chuckle the way hispanic people explain their problems as how americans/other english speakers explain theirs.

Like this mexican lady. She call on my --I believe-- third day and I open with my script in english: ""Thank you for calling [Company]. This is [Name], how may I help you?"", she the asked if I spoke spanish, I told her I did and she then went into this long rant/story about her ex-husband:
 • That he was a manipulative, demanding, overbearing liar.
 • That he once appear at her door with a baseball bat.
 • That he kept threatening her with taking away the account she had with us.
 • That he kept stalking her, her phone and everything she did with it. Who she talked to, what she talked about.

My God, poor woman.

By that point I could only listen and show some empathy. But boy did it felt surreal!
Once I got a chance in I helped her change her password and reassured her that he will not change anything to that and then--

And then a friend call her. I didn't mention her before, but the lady said that she was the one that recommend us to her.
So the friend called and man, she had some news. And the lady that called got a bit excited, but I felt she was more relieved than anything. When she finished the call with her friend she proceeded to inform me that she had finally been granted the protection order she filed against him since june.

I couldn't help but smiled. At least she was getting the help she desperately needed.

And that was it, she thank me for letting her vent, for helping her and all that jazz. I thank her for calling, wish her well and ended the call.

I still feel it was surrealxd

You can take my productivity stats and shove it where the sun don't shine.,"I'm supposed to offer certain promotions that the system thinks the customer should be recommended. 

Right now my stat for doing so is literally ""--"" because I don't talk about it with customers who generally make up the majority of calls wanting to know why their bill is so high. 

Even having to offer plan changes and adding features to generate value is such garbage. Majority of customers don't want to make changes, especially if it involves more charges on their bill. 

Honestly it is not a disservice (in my opinion) if I don't mention these to the customer. I can see everything on the account and with promos, features, and any plan changes I can definitely do the math to see that they would be paying way more then what they currently have, which I have to take the abuse for because that's still too damn high.",27,0,0
A Nice Tale,"I called into a referrals department today to make some doctor appointments. I was on hold for maybe 5 minutes, then a lady picked up and started immediately apologizing because she was getting double calls (got assigned a call while still on the phone with another patient). She asked to put me back on hold and I said that was fine. After about another 5 minutes she came back and was so grateful that I wasn't being an ass about it, explaining about the technical difficulties. I told her I spent a year in a call center getting yelled at for other people's mistakes, it's no big deal. She commisserated a little bit, and once she pulled up my account and saw my age (21) she told me I'm part of the next generation of leaders, and that she was so happy that we'll be the ones in charge when she's an old lady.

I refuse to help pricks.,"I don't really care about my call times so I didnt mind that this one was going on longer than average due to me.

At first I assumed the customer was calling in to complain about store policies around the whole covid situation (wearing a mask, not touching phones, having to make an appointment). After I let him vent his frustration he turned on me.

He asked tons of questions. Trade in values, promos, upgrades, and I'd answer every single one. All I got was how incompetent, stupid, and dumb I was. Great, glad you think so because everytime you ask those questions now I'm gonna keep answering with the same answers I just told you because I'm stupid and incompetent. I'm not providing any new information and I'm not going out of my way to find loyalty offers.

Dude wants a free repair for his phone he's owned for 2 years and out of warranty,"I work tech support and this dude came in complaining about display issues on his phone. It had a green tint all over the display, but much stronger on the upper half.

So I checked his phone information; he's had it for two years and it's no longer under warranty. I explained these to him, but he demands a free repair because *""ur devices very expensive are sht low quality""*.

So I gave him a link where he could enter his serial number and check his warranty status to reiterate he doesn't have warranty anymore. I even explained that we would've understood if he was pertaining to a factory defect (it wasn't), but regardless it's been two years so he wouldn't be able to use that excuse either.

I had to explain why he's not getting a free repair multiple times. When he realized his shit wasn't working with me, he proceeded to claim the damage was caused by software and because of that we should give him a complimentary repair.

Our software has not had one single case of an issue like this, so I called bs immediately. I even guided him to take a screenshot and preview the photo for him to see the green tint doesn't appear in the screenshot, so it's definitely not software and has to do with hardware.

This went on over and over again with me explaining why it isn't a software issue, then he demands a free repair again.

We have a policy where if we can't gain agreement with a customer, we could contact a senior tech support and pass them over to them. I did it and the senior took over.

Later, I went back to check what happened with this dude's case and the senior basically just repeated everything I said. He tried to gain agreement with the customer three times that we can offer service options but he has to pay. Customer still insisted on a free repair so the senior support ended his chat because it wasn't going anywhere.

First of all, I've got nothing against Indians. But, most customers I've had who contact us demanding free repairs for devices that are out of warranty are mostly Indians - and our queue handles customers globally. Someone shed some light why?",17,0,0
"""BTW I have over 80 employees and they rent a car every week!""","I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

Last friday I had this one customer who had a reservation at the airport. He paid with a debit card, so when he arrived at the counter, his rental was denied.

When I got the call I apologized for the inconvenience and advised him that I could either reschedule the reservation for the next day at another location that accepted debit cards, or issue a full refund.

CUSTOMER: I don't give a fuck about the refund, I need a car right now!

Apparently he had a wedding to attend the next day, so it wasn't possible to reschedule, and he made it abundantly clear that the only solution was to release the vehicle **NAO**

I definitely understand this guy's frustration, he just landed from his flight, is probably tired, wants to go to his hotel and sleep. With that being said, my empathy for this guy disappeared when he called me a ""motherfucking useless piece of shit"" or something like that. The customer is allowed to be frustrated, but no way in hell I'm going to allow him to talk to me like that.

Since he was too busy fighting the counter and wouldn't allow me to explain how the refund works, I just released the call. Considering that I didn't issue a refund because, again, he didn't allow me to explain, I knew he would call again.

I checked his reservation today, and he sent an e-mail to the customer service department. He accused the counter and ""the guy at the call center"" (me) of being extremely rude to him, that we lied to him about the debit policies, that we forced him to go to another rental car for a more expensive vehicle, etc.

I suppose he wasn't too happy when he received a canned apology for the incident. He replied accusing us of lying to him about the debit policies, claimed that we were racists and that he would never rent from us again.

The cherry on top? ""By the way, I have over 80 employees and they rent vehicles every week! Guess what company we're never going to use? And I've told them to write a negative review about your company!""

Customer expects us to be psychic dentists,"So to preface this, I work for a health insurance company in Australia, and part of my role is to deal with escalations. 

This woman had called previously and asked about benefits payable for a certain type of dental procedure (a crown). She was told, correctly, that she could claim x amount of dollars and she was happy. 

She called back today as she had attempted to claim with her card (which is swiped at the point of sale at the dentist) and it was rejected, so she didn’t get any money back. 

She blew up at the original officer who took her call so, enter me. It’s not word for word because I try to block out escalated calls as soon as they’re over, but you get the gist. 

Customer: I was told yesterday I’d be able to claim for this crown but I didn’t get anything today! What happened? You need to pay me what you told me you would. 

Me: absolutely, if we have provided you with the wrong information we will definitely honour our word (as is company policy) 

*checks her claim history*

M: okay so it looks like you haven’t tried to claim for a crown. The claim that came through today is for a scan of your teeth

C: yes, you need to get the scan of your teeth before you get the crown 

(Important to note that we are not trained on anything to do with dental. We use item numbers to check what benefit is paid - if I knew how to be a dentist I would NOT be answering phone calls, lol) 

M: oh okay. Was the item number you discussed with my colleague “xxx”? 

C: I didn’t ask him about the scan, he told me I was covered for a crown and I’m not, he lied to me! 

M: the scan is a completely different procedure from the crown, my colleague had no way of knowing you would be getting this scan during your call. If he had known he would have been able to tell you that no benefit is payable due to “x”. 

C: well he should have guessed, my claims are right there, I always claim for this scan right before a crown 

*checks claim history again, going back three years*

M: you haven’t claimed for one of these scans since (date) and you’ve had a crown this year without the scan preceding it 

C: it doesn’t matter, I don’t know anything about dental stuff! You’re supposed to know, I want you to listen to the call and then pay me the money I was promised! 

*by this point my eyes have rolled back so far I can pretty much see my brain, but once a member requests a formal review we can’t refuse*

M: okay, I will raise this as a complaint and your call will be reviewed. A member of the complaints team will be in touch in the next day or two to discuss the outcome. If we have misled you in any way causing a financial loss we will definitely adjust your claim to pay what was promised. Is there anything else I can help you with right now? (I say this knowing the complaint will absolutely not be resolved in her favour) 

C: okay thanks for that. Have a nice afternoon. 

To her credit, she was perfectly pleasant to me - the illusion of speaking to a “senior” staff member I suppose. But still one that warranted a few of my colleagues to message me after I launched the complaint to laugh about how ridiculous it was.",171,0,0

For context, this company don't let you ever close a call, you can't put a customer on hold to calm down, You can't escalate the call with a supervisor, you can't stay silent until they hung up or you would get fired.

Me is me and C is customer

Me: Hi thank you for calling Company, my name is Diegersii and im going to be your rental advisor, how can i help you today?

C:Thats your name? Thats a stupid name

At this point i didnt know how to answer that and i knew it wouldnt be an easy call.

C:Anyways, i want to know at what time do you close and what's the latest i can pick the car without extra charges.

The customer was trying to reach the location but because of the pandemic we only had one employee pero location so when the location is busy they transfer the costumer directly to the national line.

Me:Sure, i would be happy to help you with that, can you just tell me what is the location you are trying to reach?

C:What do you mean? I'm calling you, are you stupid?

Me:I'm sorry, sir, this is the national line, the location at the moment is busy but i can help you with this, can you just tell me what is the location?

The customer started to give numbers that i recognized as a profile number and i put it just to see who he is, but i can't see anything else from it, only costumers can see information about past rentals 

Me:I have your profile open now, how can i help you with this?

C:Do you want me to make your job for you? Open my reservation!

Me: I apologize, sir, but in order for us to be able to find your reservation we need you to provide us with the confirmation number.

C: I gave you my profile look it up with that, i don't have the number on hand

Me:Don't worry, we can find your reservation with the pick up date, pick up location and your phone number, im sorry but i can't find your past rentals in your profile, thats something that only you can see.

C: Just pull the damn reservation from my profile, kid

Me: I can't do that sir

C: They have done that in the past.

Me: Do you remember if you got transfered to another department for that?, i can't do it with my system.
 
C: OMG, are you stupid? Didn't You finish school? Why don't you learn proper English? You fucking beaner, i can't even understand what youre talking about, you sound so fucking stupid, why are you working in america if youre this useless?

And by that i got angry, i knew that if i closed the call i would get fired but i didnt care anymore.

Me: I'm sorry you feel that way, sir, i did everything i could to help you, im going to disconnect this call now, thank you for calling Company and have a nice day.

A week after i got fired and i feel like i should be ashamed for being this sensitive over stupid people but i feel happy, i should have done that before.

Never Enough,"Hello all. Not often that I post, however this is wearing on me and I'm seeking perspective.

Working for a major US telecommunications company, we get endless calls for everything, ranging from sales, tech support, billing and all that jazz. We have metrics we have to meet that are filled to the brim with minutiae on how best to provide service. 

Enter the reason for the post 

A normal practice is that supervisors will listen live to calls to ensure we are doing our job effectively and providing premier service. Most of us on my team are meeting most if not all major metrics, self included. Even my surveys, indicate im providing great service for those that care to leave one. 

So why then, must supervisors micromanage to such a degree where you always feel like you aren't doing your goddamned job??? 

2 calls where listened to where I didn't probe deeper and predict future concerns. So I have to be coached. Despite having addressed their issues and asked if they had any others concerns they would like to address.

Weekly Weirdos,"I work for a grocery chain in the US. I deal with online orders that go wrong; delivery not made, items missing, overcharging, info updates, bad stores, etc. This is the weird ones from this week.

* Customer called in about how long the wait times in the store were ... while in the store waiting to check out. When asked if she know that she had contacted the national support line, the customer did. When I called the store, the Manager on Duty went ""What?""
* Explained how internet traffic works ... to a customer who built/programmed computers for Raytheon in the 1960's and 70's. After I got over my cringe, we had a kickass chat about technology. (I'm the weirdo here.)
* Customer called in about an umbrella nailing her front windshield. Customer was told that someone would contact her. It had been less than 24 hours and she was contacting customer service after 4 PM on a Saturday. Kept using word like ""lawyer"" but never threatened to sue. When I couldn't get someone for her, she promptly hung up.
* Customer asked for assistance returning frozen chicken. A lot of frozen chicken. More than what you're thinking. Double that¹. Customer had been told no at the store because he didn't have a receipt. We could not do the return over the phone for the same reason, even though I could find the transaction (receipts have a unique identifier on them that I don't have access to). Was going to ""the media"" about this and hung up.

Now, for the non-weird:

* Customer called in about a bad experience they had with a manager. Customer had been trying to place a bakery order with the store for two days and getting nowhere. Customer called the store and spoke to a manager on the third day to see if they could do the order for that day. Was told no, that they need 24 hours. Manager offered compensation for the issue. Customer agreed, but still wanted to place the order. Manager placed the phone down before parking it on a hold line and started going off on the customer to their subordinates/co-workers that were standing there with them. Customer heard everything. Customer then called back to the store and read the Manager the riot act. The called me.

That's it for this week. If I get more oddballs, I'll share. I'm pretty sure that it will considering that the holidays are coming up and that **always** brings out the strange.

The time the wife found out about the second business account,"I worked for a cell phone company a while back this was in 2018 and I had a wife call in and ask about their bill. (She was authorized on the first account but not the other) so she wanted to go over a specific change to the account 

I type in the husbands social  she didn’t want to give me phone numbers, I see two accounts under his name 

I say okay I have your account pulled up and she says why is there a 6th line added? When did it happen? And what type of phone is it? 

I confirm with her it was added in store, advised her the date it happened, and that it is an iPhone XS 

She says I never authorized this and I say this is something that was added in store we require identification to process these types of requests. She hangs up 

About and hour later the husband calls, and I get the call (Spanish line, only a few against available) 

He starts yelling that we made a mistake that he never added the phone, I pull up his accounts. Tell him the same information I gave the wife, he started flipping out and says we made a mistake as the phone should have been added to his other account, I apologize and advise him I will transfer him to activations to fix the issue. 

Meanwhile my co-worker is on the line with the wife and she’s now demanding the phone number of the new line 

I was explaining the situation to the activations rep and was telling her how he had 2 accounts one where his wife let’s call her Linda is authorized and another where a lady let’s call her Beth is the authorized person. 

Turns out the man had 2 families and the rep in the store pulled up his first account because he gave them his first accounts  phone number (he had 2 phones) instead of the phone number on the second account, the wife called the number according to my coworker while she was on the line and Beth answered thinking the man had changed his phone number since the caller ID had his name and she just heard her say “I am his wife” 

I still wonder what ended up happening, as he hung up before I could finish the transfer.

Me: Oh I’m sorry, did you say-

"The cell phone bill, the girl in every port, and the naive wife","The time, circa 2009

The place, a call center handling billing disputes for a major US cell phone carrier

I handled billing disputes and customer complaints, when someone thought that there was a problem with their account, that charges were fraudulent, when people thought SOMETHING was wrong with their bill that they were sure wasn't their fault.

This meant we got some interesting calls and unique claims.  Even a decade later, this one stands out.

A lady called in, saying her husband's phone was malfunctioning, that or the towers in a few towns were fraudulently billing her husband's phone for calls he wasn't making while he was driving near them.

That's pretty much unheard of, if not outright impossible, so I prodded for more information while pulling up the account.

She said that her husband is a truck driver, who drives a route from Kansas City up to Winnipeg and back along I-29 several times a week.  She was looking at the cell phone bill and noticed her husband was getting roaming charges on his phone.

This was before unlimited roaming, and when some more rural areas didn't have good phone coverage.  

Sure enough, she looked at the bill, and most times he drove by this town, either way, he'd get a call billed from his phone to a number, always the same number, and it was in a roaming area so there would be a small charge for the call.

I looked at the bill, I saw the same charges.  I looked back at previous months bills, same charges, going back for months, a couple of times a week there was a call to this number passing through this small town along I-29 in South Dakota.

Then she says she's talked to the wives of other truckers in the trucking company, and their husbands are apparently getting the same calls billed to their phone.  Some on other phone companies aren't having them billed as roaming, but calls to that number are coming through when they pass through too.

She said she dialed the number and a young woman answered who said she has no idea who her husband is, or any of those men, and is as confused as anyone else is by all this and said she has nothing to do with this.

Uh huh.

She insists this is some nefarious phone malfunction, or someone is hacking the cell towers to have the towers bill phones for calls they aren't making.

Well.  That's NOT the conclusion I'm coming to.  However, we're told to NOT call customers liars, or imply they are misleading anyone.

So, I can't tell her what seems screamingly obvious to me.  So I offer to block the number from the phone, telling her I can have it blocked as if it was harassment, and that no phone on the account would be able to dial that number any more.  I suggested she have the other wives do that as well.  

She agreed.  

I told her I couldn't remove the charges though.  She was slightly grumpy about that, but I told her that if charges for calls to that number ever reappeared, we'd take them off since they were supposed to be blocked, and to not hesitate to call us again if she wanted to block other numbers that mysteriously appeared on her husbands phone while he was passing through that area.

She seemed to accept that.

“You’re spying on me!”,"I worked for a cable company in customer retention. For those of you that don’t know, we were essentially the last line of defense to keep customers from terminating their account with us and going to another provider. Calls about improper account credits, discounts, too high of bills, late technicians, and more came our way if the customer threatened to close their account, so we had to be on our toes. Whatever we “lost” impacted our paychecks, as we worked for commission. 

Forgive me, because this call happened about 6 years ago, so the details are a little fuzzy, but is still very memorable to me. It went something like this:

Me: Thank you for calling *company name*, my name is *my name*, how can I help you?

Customer: I want to cancel my service.

Me: I’m sorry to hear that. (I verify her account to make sure I’m talking to the account owner.) May I ask why you’re canceling?

Customer: I had my services installed a month ago and YOU’RE SPYING ON ME?

Me: I’m sorry, did you say we’re spying on you?

Customer: Yes. Your technician that came out to my house hid a camera and is recording me. 

Me: WHAT?! (Now I’m kind of panicking.) First off, I’m so sorry about this, and I don’t blame you for wanting to cancel your service. Regardless, even though you want to cancel your account, I have some questions for you because this is a serious invasion of your privacy and I need to get to the bottom of it. 

Customer: Just cancel my account. 

Me: I can do that, but I need some information from you first. If we have a technician installing service and hiding cameras in customers houses, we need to know all the details, because that’s not acceptable. So I need to know, where is the camera? Did you see him hide it in your house.

Customer: Well, no. But I know you’re spying on me. 

(At this point I’m thinking she’s just trying to get out of her contract and something isn’t right.) 

Me: How do you know that the technician installed a camera to record you?

Customer: I can see myself on the TV. 

Me: WHAT? You can see yourself on your TV?

Customer: Yes, I’m watching myself on the screen right now. 

Me: Is your DVR box turned on? 

Customer: Yes. 

Me: What channel is it on?

Customer: I have it set to channel 11.

(I quickly grab the remote in the call center and change to channel 11. It’s a normal tv show.)

Me: I have a TV here, I changed it to channel 11, but I only see *program name*. There’s nothing showing on that show that resembles the inside of a house. Are you sure your DVR box is on? 

Customer: Yes, but let me turn on my TV to check. 

Me: Wait. Your TV isn’t turned on?

Customer: No. It isn’t even plugged in. I got scared when I saw you were recording me. 

Me: But you can see yourself on the TV right now?

Customer: Yes.

Me: Ma’am, are you by chance in a bright room?

Customer: Yes. 

Me: Ma’am, that’s your reflection. 

Customer: No it isn’t. 

Me: Can you try plugging in and turning on your TV?

Customer: Ok, but I still want to cancel my service. 

Me: Ok, but can you still check for me? I want to make sure I have all the appropriate information to investigate the technician that installed your service. 

Customer: Ok. The TV is on. *Name of show I mentioned earlier* is on right now. 

Me: Can you see yourself?

Customer: No. 

Me: Can you turn the TV off? Can you see yourself again now. 

Customer: Yes. 

Me: That appears to be your reflection doesn’t it. 

Customer: Yeah. I think you may be right. So when will my service be cancelled?

Me: Whenever you’d like, but just so you know, there is a $230 dollar cancellation fee for breaking your contract. 

Customer: Never mind then! (Hangs Up)",215,0,0
"It's been years from calls like this, but yisus","Man, I stopped working there at least 3 years now. I knew this kind if stuff happened but I never thought I was going to help someone with an issues like that.

I was working for a credit card phone line on a disputes department to put it lightly, about 2 weeks in my new position (I already worked there for a couple of months, I was moved to that specific department). 

Thing is that I started recieving calls about a dollar or a cent charge on a card followed with a big charge for a 100 dollars. This first one, I got a gentleman. He was confused where this charge was comings from. The only thing he knew was that the website was asking for a card for a few cents. So we decided to call them.

The lady responded on the other line.
Thank you for calling MBIprobiller, how can I help you?

Then she explained that it was a one time charge for a trial, and then a bigger charge would be on for a whole month of access.

And then, he had to ask;

Cost: I'm sorry, what is this service for?

A guy from a remote Pacific island waits for his order to arrive,"I used to work as a customer support agent for Amazon Germany. I received a call from a dude telling me his order is late. This is a standard issue, so I looked it up and I've noticed that the expected shipping time was more than a month and that his parcel is late for more than 10 days after the expected delivery date. That's when I saw that he's living in Vanuatu, an island country in the Pacific ocean. 

This was highly unusual. He's from a remote country which many people have never heard of, let alone met someone from there. Also, this was German Amazon, focused on customers from Germany and the EU, so his shipping fees alone were in the triple digits.

Nevertheless, I followed the standard procedure and I proceeded to give a call to the carrier to see what happened to the order. Apparently, the guy doesn't even live on the main island, he lived on a small island with around 500 people on it, which was remote even for Vanuatu standards, so the carrier just left the parcel at the post office in the capital city and let them deliver it.

So I called the Vanuatuan post office and it was painfull to get information. Vanuatu doesn't have zip codes and the operator at the post office isn't sure where the customer's island is, so I was constantly putting them on a hold to get specific info from the customer and then telling the operator and listening to the operator's extra questions. 

So, apparently, only once in two weeks the mail is being delivered to the customer's island and that date has passed and the parcel is on the customer's island for over a week now. In the end, the operator, despite being complicated, has helped me and gave me the phone number of the ""post kiosk"" on the customer's island.

To keep a long story short, I called the number I was given (the conversation with the customer has been going on for around 15 minutes now) and the Vanuatuan version of a local mayor answered the phone, telling me that the only postman on the island has recently passed away and there's no one to deliver any post, so they were waiting for a new guy to arrive from another island.

At this moment I was trying not to sound shocked by the bizzarity of the entire situation, so I resumed the call with the customer and tried to calmly say what happened like it's a normal occurance and the customer replies me with ""Oh, you're right, I knew that guy...""

At this moment I was just like WTH IS HAPPENING!

This is a case I'm going to remember for the rest of my life. Since he didn't call as instructed if he doesn't get his parcel by the certain date, I believe he got his parcel in the end. If boxes could talk, this one would have an adventure to tell...

Update: The customer lives on the island of Sola, north Vanuatu",633,1,0

I just quit my call center job of almost 2 years and I’m so happy. I realized I have so many awesome stories though so I thought I’d start sharing them now.

(K gives me the order number)

Me: Thanks for that! Looking here, I can see this order is over a year old. Our return policy is only 30 days from the date of delivery so I can’t accept this. 

K, very snottily: Well it wasn’t installed until last week so it wasn’t a year old. 

Me: Ma’am, the policy is 30 days from delivery. You bought these last year so the 30 days has passed, plus you just said you installed them and we can’t take back any thing that’s been installed anyway. I’m sorry, but no.

K: FINE! I was a really loyal customer (with 3 orders total) and I will never be a customer of yours again. You’ve always worked with me before on returns and I don’t understand why you can’t now! 

Me: It’s possible they were closer to the date of delivery, not a year old. Our system literally won’t let me do anything. You can call the manufacturer though, and I’d be happy to provide their information.

K: No, I bought these from YOU. YOU should be doing whatever it takes to make me happy but I’m never doing business with you again!!

Me: Ok ma’am, is there anything else you needed help with? 

K: NO.

Me: Ok then, thanks for calling, and have a great day!

"Husband not on loan, but wants info anyways.","We are all big kids not apologizing for the format.

her- ash better than Pokémon
3rd party husband- brent

So ash had a caller named brent call in pretending to be his wife “Sarah”. Until he was found out when he stated during phone verification that “that is my wife’s number.” Ash said ‘ok sir what’s your wife’s name?’ And he said “Sarah is the one on the loan.” Ash said ‘sir I would have to get your name and phone number’ after he yelled about it. He gave it to her and she said ‘sir I would have to look into your authorization.’ After a lot of cussing and swearing at her and he said that “I’m her husband and you have to give account specific information” (this is illegal it violates so many protection laws). Ash warned him time that if he doesn’t stop swearing then she will release the call (we can release if they swear after we warn them, just can’t release if they yell). He proceeded to yell at her and call her names without swearing so she couldn’t release the call (so he can give her his lovely demeanor). (She muted the call and lit up a cigarette and just listened as he ranted and raved (she works from home)). After about 10 minutes enough time to finish a cigarette and half a soda he yelled “are you still there?” She unmuted it and said ‘yes sir, is your wife there to authorize you?’ He did NOT like that!!! He proceeded to yell again and said “my wife is a nurse and she is on the front line and she doesn’t have time to deal with your ‘crap’” (folks he said something worse than crap) (ash zoned out his rant and forgot she already warned him about it but she warned him again not to swear). So after even more yelling she got permission to transfer to a supervisor he said “you damn well better”, ash said ‘sir I warned you not swear, but I’m gonna have to release this call, have a nice a day’ and she hung up.",46,0,0
Christmas isn't going to arrive,"This was from several years ago when I was WFH, it was actually a decent company to work for. I was working a retail company customer support. That was rough, I was hired for the Christmas season, so I only worked like a week before the rush hit, that was rough, but we got backed up pretty good by management. 

So anyway, I get a call, and the woman is pissed. She just got her tracking information and her package wasn't scheduled to arrive until Dec. 27th. So I listened to her yell, scream and cuss for about 5 minutes, before I made the fatal mistake of trying to identify with her. I told her that a few years before, we had ordered something for our son, and  it didn't arrive until sometime in February, so I understood her anger. That was the wrong fucking thing to say. It didn't matter what I had been through it was nowhere close to what she was going through, I mean after all my son that the gift was for was only 11 or 12 at the time, and her son was almost 30. Her son should be old enough to understand and be ok with the situation, even if disappointed. But explain to a 12 y/o their gift isn't arriving until February.   

So that was about another 8 minutes of her getting increasingly mad at me now for trying to sympathize. Then she ask for a supervisor. I tell her (as we've been directed to) maam, I would be glad to transfer you, but it will be at least an hour wait, I would be glad to look at your file and see what I can do to expidated the shipment and get it there on time. HELL FUCKING NO she wants a supervisor, and I explain that I will put her on hold, transfer the call, and she will be answered by the next available supervisor. NO, I was to let the supervisor know she wanted to talk to her, but I wasn't to put her on hold for anything. I told her that I would have to put her on hold long enough to send the call to the supervisor department, and then I would be right back, she got my first name, I wouldn't give her my last no matter how much she complained, I gave her my operator number and all that, so that she could complain if I didn't come back to her. 

So I put her on hold, then jumped on our in house chat program and sent a note to the supervisor department about what was going on, and that she wanted me to sit on hold with her until a supervisor came on the line. It wasn't but just a few minutes I got the message back to do that, just whatever she wanted but go ahead and try to reroute the package, or find one closer or whatever and get it sent to her. So that's what I did, by the time the supervisor came on I just knew this woman was going to have a stroke, her blood pressure had to be pushing out the top of her head. I've never dealt with anyone that furious before, no body but myself, anyway. 

I told her, I don't blame you for being upset, she had every right to be pissed, she ordered because the website said it would get to her in time, now she's being told a couple of days after Christmas. But I didn't get that mad when I found out my son's gift wouldn't be there for two months after Christmas.  Those calls I hated taking, I can usually calm anyone down, no matter what they are mad about. I just have what it takes to talk to them, and calm them down. But those I can't calm down, they bother me, not because of the customer, but because I couldn't do what I normally do. I've managed restaurants.,  pizza delivery, you get some really pissed off people in that industry, but every time there was a problem, no matter how furious the customer was, I calmed them down, and when the office called to see how we could improve our service, every one of them said, I'm glad we had the problem, now I know that your company stands behind it's promise, and will fix whatever is wrong. Usually I just gave the customer two or three options, not these are your options, but well, you know, we could do this, or we could do that, or I'm not supposed to, but for you I""ll do this other, you just tell me what you want to do. This was planned out, I gave them three things that would make them happy, but not cost me an arm and a leg. They picked the one they wanted, or they mixed and matched whatever, and I did that for them, and they were happy. It's all in how you talk to them. But these calls, like this lady unable to do anything for her. Whatever she ordered there wasn't but one available in the whole country, and it was snowed in somewhere, and there was no getting it out. There was nothing we could do. I made notes of everything, to pass along, finally after an hour and fifteen minutes, the supervisor buzzed me, so I transferred her and the notes, and just prayed the supervisor could do better than I did, for her sake.",16,0,0

Funny thing is once you tell me the charges your asking for a refund, I place the call on hold for like 10 seconds only to come back and tell you guys, nah, sorry, cant refund this, refer to our terms and conditions!


P.S. Not really complaining since you guys bring down our AHT a lot. If its evaluated too, its auto 100 right away so.. cant complain, plus taking a call like this brings me again to the bottom of the queue.

"""It was 5 minutes early so it's their fault!""","Hey everyone! I worked at a call centre where I took calls from car insurance clients about their accidents for 2 years and had to leave as I was thisclose to having a mental breakdown because of the work. I was probably too soft for it anyway, as the people on the phone were often upset or angry because of their accidents and tended to take it out on the unlucky person on the other line (aka, me). However there were some really funny calls as well, which is what I want to share with you today.


A man called in saying he had reversed off his driveway and hit a bus whilst doing so. I took all the details - time, date, location, damage to his vehicle and the bus etc. Now, we always had to ask them whether or not they thought the accident was their fault as well, and the response in the title is what he came back with.


Yeah... so a bus was the one at fault because... it dared to be there 5 minutes early...? 

I kept it together somehow, but he quickly became one of the stories we laughed at when we needed cheering up later on. 


So remember kids - it's not your fault if you were expecting the bus to arrive later and then hit it! /s

[M] don't you love it when you speak with adjustment abusers??? I do,"Just finished up a conversation with a Karen, he account is flashed in all our systems that state to sustain all charges on her bills due to her calling in every month and abusing the adjustment system. She tells me that he TV/internet bill is too high (which it's actually not), and that it's racial profiling to charge her tax (actually, it's not, and you're not tax exempt). I explain the charges, politely inform her that charging government taxes and fees happen to everyone, not just her. So Karen gets all huffy, starts screaming and hyperventilating, then admits to calling every month and demanding we credit her account, and the only reason why the agents do is because she pulls her big girl card of, ""I guess I'm just going to have to call my lawyer then won't I?"" So she asks me what I think of that, I let her know that she definitely has the option of contacting a lawyer about these charges. So that sets her off, she starts swearing at me, calls me a ""white trash racist honky"". During the time she takes a breath I let her know that if she is going to insist on using vulgar language and racial slurs, the call would end. She starts laughing at me, tells me to what I can do with her bill, then hangs up. Good job making a complete ass of yourself Karen!!!",30,0,0
Excuse me???,"Years ago I worked for a satellite tv company. Customer calls in, mad about something. Was still in his explanation rant, not letting me speak and getting more worked up. I turned to a co worker to mime 'shoot me' or something like that and then tuned back in to the call. It sounded like he may have asked a question that I missed so I said, ""Excuse me?""


Not a question, he had actually been swearing and immediately said how sorry he was for taking that tone with me.

"I either don't know our policies, or I'm just being lazy","This just happened this past Tuesday. It was a whole morning of absolute ridiculousness. Anyway, for our luscious  cast we have:

Me: Me

Sharon: Caller who had the nerve

And so, we begin our tale on Tuesday morning, around 8:45, I believe. Let me preface this by saying that at this point, I've worked here for just over a year and a half. I know what I'm doing. If I don't, I'll bug a supervisor until I do.

Me: ""Thank you for choosing Local FI, my name is TamHawke. Can I get your name?""

Sharon: ""My name is Sharon Who Had The Nerve."" 

Me: ""And how are you doing today?""

Sharon: something along the lines of ""Good.""

Me: Proceeds to verify member with info on the account and then: ""How can we help you today?""

Sharon: ""I want to transfer funds from my Local FI account to Federal FI.""

Me: ""Well. Apologize, ma'am, but we can't do that for you over the phone, you'll have to go to a Local FI service center to do ant shared branching*, or you can log on to your Local FI account online and transfer the money through Online Transferring Service Partner. You can do standard 3 businessdays delivery for free or next businessday for a $5 fee.""

Sharon: ""They did it for me over the phone last time. What changed?""

Me:  Immediately rolling my eyes because I know where this load of bull is going. ""We have never done shared branching over the phone, as we cannot access that system. If they did it for you before it was with a branch over the phone and it was a one time courtesy while we were closed due to the pandemic. We have never done those transactions over the phone. Do you remember the name of the rep who did this for you before?""

Sharon: ""No, but it was just a few months ago.""

Me: ""They likely did you a courtesy when our lobbies were closed, but we've been open since mid May, you'll have come inside to transfer funds from Local FI to Federal FI We cannot do this for you over the phone.""

Sharon: ""They did this for me before, so you should be able to.""

Me: ""We cannot do this for you over the phone.""

Sharon: ""I don't mean to be rude, but you either don't know your policies, or you're just being lazy.""

Me: Uses every fiber of my being to not reach through this phone and alter the fabrics of time and space to smack this person. ""Ma'am. If you have the name of the person who did this for you before-- which was a one-time courtesy --I can get you to them. As I said. We cannot do this transfer for you over the phone. You'll have to go into a branch or do it through online banking.""

Sharon: ""I'm really not trying to be rude, but this is ridiculous.""

Me: Wishing I could call her out on her obvious rudeness without being fired. ""Is there anything else I can do for you?""

Sharon: ""No. Bye.""

Made a Point to be Nice,"I don’t work in a call center but I’m a long time lurker because.... I don’t know why, you guys are interesting writers I guess.  Also on phone and hoping I format correctly.


Anyway, I had to call in to a store credit card today because when I received the bill I didn’t have the money that day so I set it aside but then forgot until today.  So now it’s late. Dang! I know that’s going to get me a $39 late fee.  I know- let’s try calling in (and being nice about it)

Ten minutes later I’m connected to a guy with an accent and I explain I had misplaced bill, forgotten to pay it, it’s my fault, I’ve got the money right now to make a payment, just looking for some grace.


Poor guy must have heard some stuff because he went on and on about how nice it was that I was acknowledging my mistake and it showed I had good character and he appreciated it.  He took the late charge off, I made my payment and we separated ways.


If I wasn’t a reader of this sub I still would have been nice, but reading your stories made me extra aware of my tone and wording.  And because of you, I guess his day was a bit nicer.

Testing out a theory,"So me and many people in my personal circle work/have worked in call centers and we've noticed certain ""thresholds"" for people insofar as how long they last at a call center.  It seems to be that many people don't make it a full year.  If they do make it the full year, the next threshold seems to be 4ish years, and if you make it past 4ish years then people tend to be in it for the long haul.  Obviously there will be some outliers but that seems to be how it goes for the most part.  I'm at 4.5 years myself and am pretty much done.  Was just wondering what this subs experience with this was!",6,0,0
Oh the irony.,"Two weeks ago (on a Friday) I had a major Karen call in. She was trying to pick up something from our warehouse but it wouldn’t fit in her car. I told her we could add shipping we would just need to charge more and our warehouse team would need to transfer the items to the shipper as she had technically taken the items out of our warehouse and returned them when she couldn’t fit in her vehicle. The warehouse needed to update her order in our system before I could add shipping.

The following monday (1 business day later) she called back wondering where her shipment was saying it “had been a week” and I Hadn’t arranged shipping for her (which I couldn’t do as the order had not been processed by the warehouse). She then demanded free shipping due to the week long delay (try a day lady) and to be escalated to a manager. She ended up agreeing to pay for shipping after speaking to a manager.

Fast forward to today and my favourite customer is back in contact on live chats. She contacted a colleague at 10:30 frantic as her delivery window was scheduled between 9am and 11 am and the order hadn’t arrived yet. He calmed her down and explained it should be there in a half hour. At 11:15 she chatted in again - no delivery. So I called the delivery team. They told me they had called her for delivery around 10:30, and had knocked on her door and waited outside for 10 minutes before moving on to the next delivery. She was literally on chat ignoring the phone calls complaining about late delivery when the delivery people were outsider her door. 

If you were so desperate to get a delivery as to call and chat in multiple times, exaggerate about a “delay”, escalated to a manager and demand compensation, you’d think a fraction would of that effort could have been applied to actually being vigilant and receiving a shipment.

In the end the shipper was able to return and delivered very the same day, even though the customer missed the delivery initially. But the items were damaged in transit... so I guess I’ll be speaking with Karen again on Monday.",52,0,0
oh the call didn't end did it....,"I'm watching scam-baiting videos on youtube right now and their frustration reminded me very suddenly of the worst troubleshooting call I ever had to do when I was helping old ladies with their MLM accounts a few weeks ago. The whole company was a total scam, and even though working there was necessary for my continuing to be alive, it was a bit hard on my morality (I did quit though). 

I had this lady I was helping who just didn't know how to use a computer, which was fine since we figured the problem out eventually. After about 30 minutes, she figured out how to open the reset password email. She apologizes that it took so long and honestly, I love how polite she is. I'm not mad, I'm just done with my job at this point and it's hour 6 of my 9 hour shift. I spent a minute promising her I was fine and letting her know it was all okay. So when I hear the click of the phone hanging up, I take a second and let out a very loud groan. Not at her, just general life, tired, sick of working from home stuff. 

And then I hear ""uh hello?""

Ahhh... crap. For some reason, there was a click on the phone but the call didn't end. 

I panicked and hung up, but I still feel bad about that one. Sorry lady! You were fine! I just hated my job!",160,0,0
"Yeah, nah","So, my TL is out for the day. I will say that my TL is a stand up dude. He has consistently gone to bat for us, listened to what's causing problems, and will get it fixed. Seriously, 10/10 leadership. 

And last time he was out, he got us great stand ins to support us. Today though, just... the worst pick possible. 

We have a team meeting over Zoom in the mornings to discuss numbers, best practices, and important updates. We are scheduled for these, and when he wasn't there last time, we still had it at the same time. We all log into the call, and... it's just us. Just kinda wondering what's going on. We decide to just go over best practices, figure out where we need help and asking and helping. Productive use of our time. 

We get on with our day. 2 hours later, long after our scheduled time, the other TL pulls us off the phones for the meeting. Awesome. So we idle out and join the meeting. Provided we weren't on a call. Some of us were. The TL didn't wait or verify we were all there either. Just started without some people. 

First and foremost, they want us to have our cameras on. Like it was a whole production of getting everyone to turn them on. We work from home. We aren't ready for face to face meetings. I personally look homeless at the moment. But apparently, they needed to see our faces. Oooookay, well, my camera is ""busted"". Sorry. 

From there, we're admonished for having our meeting. At the right time. The time on our schedules. That's not efficient apparently. If I'm understanding their point correctly based on their actions, efficiency is using time we don't have scheduled for a meeting, to have a meeting. That not everyone was there for. Because they started the meeting in the middle of the say. When we're on the dialer. Guess efficiency means something else, fuck the dictionary. 

Then comes the snark. Keep in mind, this is the first time  we're interacting with this person. They admonished us for using the time we have scheduled for a meeting to have that meeting. And they decide to get sarcastic about how quiet we are being. Oh wow. We don't wanna talk to someone who has criticized us for doing what we're supposed to do and is a hypocrite? I'm flabbergasted. Absolutley stumped. Why might that be? Could it be that you've shown that you're kind of the worst? 

It goes on, goes over some stuff that... honestly we already knew. This was such a waste of time and energy that it makes me think this person totally ignored what our TL said and assumed she knew best. Everyone whose camera wasn't ""busted"" was just... staring at the camera. We were just done with it all. ""Why do you look so bored?"" Because you're a pain in the ass and the alternative is glaring daggers. That's why. 

At the end, they say ""you should be on team [name]"". And thank fuck I was on mute, because my first reaction was to blurt out ""yeah, nah, that's the stupidest thing I'm gonna hear all day"". I do debt collection. I hear some seriously dumb shit. And I'm 100% confident in that statement. I stand by it. 

Just... fucking hell. I do not like that TL in the slightest. I do not like people who are snarky, inefficient hypocrites. And I especially do not like them when that is the first time I'm interacting with them.",122,0,0
People who bully to get their way,I won’t post too much detail because this just recently happened. People who call into places trying to bait reps into arguments to then try to get some kind of compensation for their “bad customer service experience” are the worst. I had to spend an hour with an individual personally attacking me and wanting to confront a previous rep to see if I would take the bait. Thankfully I didn’t engage and he ended hanging up saying I was impossible. This person even boasted how last time he had to argue to get his way and has done it before then. People like that deserved to be banned by companies.,31,0,0
Boomer: It's our fault,"Had an elderly customer ring last month, a boomer. I'm in my early 20s myself.

I helped him with his account etc, I threw in some small talk as well as you do. We ended up talking about holidays, the world right now, the economy etc. I usually end up venting about the shoddy work of our (UK) government and customers will agree.

M:me C: customer

M: well this economy has gone down the drain hasn't it. Wasn't very strong to begin with.

C: well that's my generations fault, and the generation above mine.

M:sorry? It's my generations fault, the millennials. That's the usual thing right?

C: no not at all. We set up the economy like it is, we were wasteful and were greedy. You millennials are living in the world that my generation created and it's a shit show.

Now I'm sure it's six of one and half of the other with how things are, it was just strange to hear someone of that generation acknowledge something like that.

Edit: people saying he's GenX and not boomer when I say middle aged, I personally wouldn't day boomers are elderly so

I swear I don’t know why this charge is there.,"Today is my first solo shift (after 5 days of mentoring) working remotely for a call center on behalf of a southern based wireless service provider. Had a customer call in. They wanted to ask about a charge on their account that they claim was not supposed to be there. Go through basic verification, check their account. They had just opened their account with us. They had said they had called in to get a new phone, that they didn't qualify for the device they wanted, so they went in store and paid cash for another device. I can see on their account that there are 3 events, all charges. 2 charges at a store, 1 charge from the call center. Look over the charges, they seem to be standard charges. One of the charges is for a case. Another is a phone. And the other is a phone plus activation fees, plan fees and E911 fee. I try explaining that to them that the charges look standard, but I would check with one of our account specialists (L2) to be sure. Checked, they told me that everything is normal and theres nothing we can do. I tell the customer as much, that the charges from the call center are for activation fees and plan fees. They do not like that, and they ask if I can escalate it or if there's someone they can speak to. they insist that there arent supposed to be any activation fees or anything, that it was supposed to be free. Thankfully, they aren't upset with me. So I call up one of our L2s, give them the rundown. The L2 agrees, the charges are standard, but the customer might need to hear it from someone else, someone with ""higher authority"". Before I can transfer the customer, they hang up. And from what I can tell, they called in later, not satisfied with the answer, and then disconnected when they still didn’t get the answer they wanted. But frankly, looking over that call center charge, it has their card info on it. Meaning they gave the rep that info. So that charge was supposed to be there.",21,0,0
Another tale from the Ash chronicles!! White people are horrid (people ash is so white),"Still not apologizing for that formatting. 

So this older lady called in we will call her Stacy. (Ash can’t see what color this lady is (no matter how much they think we can)) she started out very polite and very sweet.  Until it came time to verify phone number. Then she turned into a racist bitch. When ash asked for verification on last four digits of phone number. 
Old lady (Stacy) said “two white women stole my phone number you should know this (in southern accent)!” 
Ash said ‘I’m sorry to hear that ma’am do you still remember the old phone number so I can verify it?’ Stacy: “fine, even though those white women stole it” so she rattled off the number. 
Ash said ‘do you want me to update your phone number?’
Stacy: “yes”, gave her the information and went through the script and asked to hold, ash said her system was slow and it would take a moment to catch up. 
Ash immediately got her supervisor called Hyde (for obvious reasons). Ash asked if she could listen on the call as racism was noted and didn’t want anything coming back on her or the company. Hyde said ‘sure’ and got on another headset to listen. 
So Hyde gave thumbs up ash brought Stacy off hold and thanked her for waiting. 
Ash asked ‘what can I assist you with today?’ 
Stacy said “I got a notice of transfer, are you transferring me because I’m black?”
Ash said ‘no ma’am this is common practice with loans. Loans are bought and sold all the time’ (keep in mind she’s looking at Hyde like wtf, Hyde is shaking her head like idk). 
Stacy decided to rant about how we were being prejudice and that we were racial profiling because she was black. And ash is obviously white according to her and Stacy not isn’t wrong she is white but ash doesn’t care cause Stacy just another customer that she deals with a hundred a day. 
During the rant Stacy threw out that she was just as white as any other woman because she was raised by nuns. She already made it very clear that she was black and proud of it. 
That line caught ash off guard because that literally went against what she was previously ranting about. 
Hyde told ash to hard close (that means do closing wether or not they still need assistance)(you fucked up if you get a hard close) keep in mind this call was going on 40 minutes all about her race and how we are racist against black people because we sold her loan. 
Ash said ‘I’m sorry I can’t be of more assistance ma’am’ and hung up the phone. 
Keep in mind her only experience with prejudism when she was in the army and she was told by a Sargent that she was a piece of crap because she was white. Ash had know idea how to deal with this and Hyde told her to go on a break.",0,0,0
Karen gets angry that I'm doing my job.,"Y'all, today has been one of those days.

Anyway, here's the tea.

I'm enjoying my shift which happens quite often.  We all know this is Karen bait, as they love to ruin a good day.

*Cue entrance of Karen via phone call.

I answered the call and a lady said they had a company refer her client to us, as their company doesn't handle something that we do. I was trying to make sure I was spelling the referral company name correctly and she snapped she didn't have all day and to get on with it. I gave up trying to spell it and moved on because I don't have the energy for this.

I framed the call, told her we need basic information before we can go over how our service works, the pricing, and then can get her scheduled.  

I got her name and the address. I asked her for the phone number and she countered by saying she would give it after the quote if she decided to go with us.  I told her it is just part of the basic information I am required to get and assured her that we don't sell her information.

She asked if I had to have the phone number and I reiterated the point above.  I told her if she didn't want to give the number, that is fine, but I couldn't move forward with the call.

She scoffed in disbelief and asked if she could speak with someone else.

 I took a big swig of my flavored water and replied matter-of-factly (and slightly sassily) a finalized ""Nope"".

She gasped in disbelief and responded about how we just lost two jobs and explained what we wouldn't be doing for them. I had a hard time refraining from telling her we wouldn't want customers like her anyway.

She then proceeded to tell me how she was going on every social media she knows and badmouthing us to all her friends.
Then proceeded to tell me ""Well Done"" twice and hung up.
Lol.
Stupid Karen's. I have no tolerance for them lol.

Edit: I noted that I hope that they respond to her reviews about how it is common policy and about how rude how was to me lol.

I lose my temper at a Grandma,"This was not my proudest moment.

This is the jist of the situation.  I answer the call and ask if the lady is a current customer.  She says she is, that she signed up with a door sales rep and wants his name.  I tell her I am just a phone sales rep and don't have access to that information, but our current customer team in her area might be able to help.  

Then she FLIPS HER LID.

""No! You give me his name and number now! All you have to do is look up my information!""

After I repeat myself several times she then screams,

""I AM CALLING THE POLICE ON YOU! I AM MARCHING DOWN TO YOUR OFFICE WITH THE POLICE AND YOUR COMPANY IS IN BIG TROUBLE!""

At this point, I think she is just another Karen flipping her lid because I didn't tell her what she wants, plus I don't work at her local office lol.

I think I told her there was no need for that and that the the current customer team would get her the name and number.

It's a bit of a blur after that, but she eventually yells that the door rep took her money and never did the services.

After she screams again that she is calling the police on us...this is where I lose my cool and raise my voice so she will shut up and listen.

I said ""MA'AM, I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU AND YOU WON'T LISTEN.  I AM TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT WE DO NOT STEAL AND ANY SALES REPRESENTATIVE NEEDS DEALT WITH APPROPRIATELY.   WE DO NOT TOLERATE THIS AND WANT TO TAKE APPROPRIATE LEGAL ACTION AND JUSTICE AND YOU ARE NOT ALLOWING US TO TO TAKE THE APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO DO SO. I AM TRYING TO SEND YOU TO THE CURRENT CUSTOMER TEAM SO THAT WE CAN HELP YOU.  I WANT TO TRANSFER YOU SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS CORRECTLY, AS WE DO NOT WANT ANYONE WITH OUR COMPANY WHO WOULD DO THIS!""


She lowered her voice to just being raised and stayed her frustration because she has called every day and the local office refuses to answer her or the other neighbours calls who have had the same thing happen to them. 
I gave her their number and after calming her down and letting her know I will stay on the line until.someone answers since her call is always dropped. (I'm not supposed to, but I felt it was the right thing to do.)

She apologized for having to be angry on the phone and I apologized for being short with her and she was cool with it.  After 10 minutes on hold I asked if she wanted me to wait on the line still or for her to get a callback.  

She said she never gets a callback, but she knows I need to do sales for a living and doesn't want me to get hurt sales wise.

I thanked her and told her I hope she reaches someone soon and hung up.

You better bet I took a break after that.",171,0,0

Bank call center,"I have two stories to share. Once I was working at bank of America call center during the great recession. I haven't worked there in years and I feel so free. I was use to rude customers, but this takes the cake. After coming back from my ten minute break, I plug in and take a call. The man was friendly at first giving his info. He was calling because he had three 35 overdraft fees. I was like sure I'll take a look at them. I go into his account and of course it was red. I saw they were pending and we couldn't process the fees until they posted. Taking a look at his account he had several in the past and they were always refunded. So he was always overdrafting his account and calling in to get the fees removed. I told him that they were pending and that he would have to call back. The guy sighs and says so theirs nothing you can do right now. I told him no. The guy asked where I was from. I told him ky. He flips out. You inbred moron, I should expect this from a ky fuck like you. All you southerners are trailer trash. The bank should've never got a bailout to screw over customers.  I started to have tears come rolling down my eyes. I had enough. I said fuck you and hung up. I told my manager I'm taking a five and the look on my face made her see how upset I was. Never got in trouble for it.

Later I told a co-worker and they told me never give out location. Because a few years ago a girl working calls who got a call like mine and the guy was friendly. She told him he couldn't get a refund and he was nice. Added her on Facebook over the phones. One day she got yellow flowers that were from a secret admirer. At the end of the day, she walks out with the flowers and the same man who befriended her was waiting for anyone who has the flowers. He shot her dead and went to prison over a couple of overdraft fees. Chilling tale.

Bonus story. One time I was working for monkey punch and a man came in to the shop to have his laptop fixed. He was very upset that he had a virus and was wondering when he could get it back. We told him the next day. He was nervous and said he would pay extra for it being fixed in an hour. I told him that we had a backlog of other desktops on top of that. He relented and left. The virus was caused by the sites he was visiting. Dog porn. Men and women getting knotted by dogs. He even had a picture of him getting knotted. We called the cops and he was arrested the next day.",57,0,0

"I won't give my birthday, but here's my address!","I work for a medical debt collection agency. Sue to HIPAA, I can't tell them anything until I confirm I'm speaking with the party, using their birthday or address, if they're hesitant to give any of that information, I'll ask for year of birth and zip code and let them know I wouldn't be able to take their identity with that information.

Sometimes, I don't even ask for the address, knowing that I'm even more hesitant to give that out to a complete stranger and just go to year of birth and zip code. What surprises me the most is there is at least one person a day that will say, ""I'll give you my address but not my birthday!"" And then give me their entire address.

I just don't understand. I would be worried a scammer would be more likely to find me with my address than my birthday. Can anyone explain this to me?",30,0,0

You Need How Many Narcotics To Function?,"Many many moons ago, I worked in a Pharmacy Call Center for a state insurance company.

I had moved from medical coding/billing to medical call center and on to pharmacy call over the span of 5 years, so I prided myself on having some common sense when it came to how Doctor's offices/staff and Pharmacy staff ""usually"" operated. However, it also clued me in to how patients (a.k.a. clients) would try to game the system.

One of my favorites was the repeat caller/patient/client who called in on a monthly basis in order to request a ""vacation override"" on a narcotic. If you're not familiar with the idea - our company allowed patients to call in to request an early refill for a monthly medication (whether blood pressure med, anti-psychotics, anti-depressants, etc.) if the patient was ""going on vacation and needed to take the medication with them, but there was a viable chance the medication could run out while they were out of the area."" The script could be filled up to two weeks early, but was usually limited to once every six months.

With this in mind, we also had patients who would ""doctor shop"" - basically making appointments with multiple doctors to have the same medication prescribed *without the doctors being aware*.

Combine these two practices and; if you have a semi-intelligent patient, this could be  a recipe for one hell of a drug supply ring successfully paid-for-in-full by the insurance company. 

Every Pharmacy Rep had been warned to watch for these red flags during training and we were even given actual examples from the system to show us what we would see and who to contact when it happened. *When - not if.* 

Imagine, if you will, the following exchange with Ms. Narcotic-On-Vacation (Narc): 

Me: Thank you for calling MEDPharm101(not really! LOL)

Narc: Hi, my name is Narc, ID#123abc and I need a vacation refill on my Vicodin.

Me: Thank you Ms. Narc - can I ask you to confirm your DOB for me.

Narc: Sure it's Jan 1st, 1899.

Me: Thank you, and I understand you need a vacation fill for your Vicodin? Let me pull up that information.

At this point, if my system had a klaxon alarm, my ears would have been bleeding. *Red Alert, Red Flag, take cover and call Superman!*

Me: Ms. Narc, I'm seeing in the system that you asked for a vacation refill last month on your Vicodin, is this correct? 

Narc: Yeah, I keep running out, the doctor's supposed to up my dose, but hasn't done it yet. 

Honestly, if the doctor had changed the script to a higher dose - if probably would have killed an elephant, but what do I know?

Me: All right, Ms. Narc - may I ask you to hold for just a moment while I get that started for you?

Narc: (totally bored by now) Yeah, sure.

I put Ms. Narc on hold and frantically flag down my Floor Manager. I show her the whole history - Ms. Narc apparently had not one - not two, doctors writing scripts for her; she had a total of SIX doctors writing scripts for the same high dosage Vicodin and was refill all of them religiously on a two week cycle. The account had been flagged previously and she hadn't been able to fill anything in about two months. We were betting her second-hand sales were starting to get a little slim now that her supply chain was running out. However, we couldn't arbitrarily cut her off and were running out of reasons to not refill the script. 

Then something she'd said to me flashed like a light bulb over my head - she'd said the doctor needed to change her script! Well - *we need an authorization from the doctor's office to accommodate that a change in narcotic scripts*! We've got a reason to shut this one down!

Fist bump the Floor Manager and she hovers nearby in case this goes belly up on me. 

Me: Ms. Narc? Thank you so much for waiting, I'm sorry that took so long. Because you mentioned a change in the script, I went through our authorizations from your doctor's office to see if anything had been sent through for you. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find anything authorizing the change in script - so I reached out the doctor's office for a new script. They weren't aware of any new changes in your script, so they need to call you to set up an appointment to come in for some lab work in order to change your medication. This also means that, without the doctor's authorization, I can't release your next refill early.

Now keep in mind - *I haven't done anything of the sort* \- the Authorizations Dept would take care of contacting the doctor's office after I get off the call.

Narc: (somewhere between aghast and enraged) You did what?? Who the H-E-double hockey sticks told you to do that??

Me: I'm sorry, Ms. Narc - but that is normal procedure with a change in script on a narcotic. The doctor's office should be giving you a call shortly in order to set up a good time for you to come for your lab work. I'm so sorry I couldn't help you with that refill - but is there anything else I can help you with today?

Narc: (spluttering, but not able to do a stinking thing about the situation, through clenched teeth) No thank you, I think you've helped quite enough.

\*click\*

I am grinning ear-to-ear and my Floor Manager's doing a happy dance next to me. I send the ticket to Authorizations outlining what happened. Now here's where it's gets even better! Now that Authorizations is taking over - they can contact ALL of the doctors on her file to confirm a script change and ""alert"" them that she's doctor shopping. This will effectively shut down her ring and black flag any new scripts being paid by the insurance company.

Extra for me? I got a nice bonus check and a Thank You letter from the Head of the Pharmacy Call Group.",771,0,0

Depression and stress leave,"Hi all,

Not sure if I’m posting this in the right place, i work for a call centre and have for nearly two years now. When i first started i somehow coped a lot better than I do now and managed to get through a full year with 0 sadness or upsets about work. However since the end of last year my mental health has completely deteriorated and i believe it is down to this job. They have ridiculous stats we have to hit a two page list of things to say every call we do every day, they take a few of our calls a month, listen to them and mark them, if we get below 90% on any of them we get put onto special measures. They change the goals and stats every few weeks and most of them are ridiculously hard to hit. They monitor our call time, in-between call time, whether we hit everything that needs to be said on each call, how many days we manage to extend the call out for (we sent technicians out to customers and have to try and give them as much time as possible) and send every stat out every morning to name and shame whoever isnt hitting them. Im failing to hit any stats they want, i cant even go to the toilet or get a drink without being penalised and just feel like i cant BREATHE or work like this anymore. I work weekends, week days shift pattern so often am there till 8pm at night. Generally most of the customers are nice but i get a screamer or two every day and it just sets me off. And the fact that the calls are CONSTANT and we are not allowed time between them kills me. Im prone to anxiety and was on antidepressants before this job and stupidly went off them just as i started here.

I cant sleep, i wake up and toss and turn all night and have migraines most mornings, feel like i havent slept in months. I cry during the day at work and have constant panic attacks (i work from home at the moment). Im depressed and some mornings i wish i never even woke up, ive started binge eating and im extremely over weight and unhealthy. I spend every day im not at work dreading going back to work. 

Im currently in the midst of waiting for a house, im a first time buyer with my boyfriend and we applied for a house back in January and then corona happened and weve been waiting months and months so i had been putting off applying to jobs, but have now been told that it wont affect our offer much so can go ahead to move jobs as we are lucky to have a massive deposit saved.

I am going to see my doctor tomorrow and im PETRIFIED that they are going to put me on stress leave and then i wont be able to get another job as ive just started applying to other jobs now. Does anyone know more about this?? Will other companies not take me if theyve seen ive been on stress leave as this would be huge for me as i simply can not work here any longer and need to have another job lined up before i quit because of the house. 

Thank you if anyone read this rant of a post, i just feel trapped and that this is all my life is ever going to be. Any advice at all is 100% welcome.",11,0,0

K: OMG I can't believe that... 

Me: Ma'am this is the last warning. I'm willing to help, but for doing so I need to explain the next steps we need to follow. I cannot do so if you keep interrupting me. If you don't allow me to talk for giving you the process required, I will havento disconnect the call. 

KD: YOU CANNOT DO THAT. 

Me: In fact I can because we are running on circles. I need to explain the solution, you're not allowing me to do so, that forces me by the policies to end the call and send the next steps to your email. So, may I speak now? 

K: You are being rude. 

Me: I'm not. I'm remaining professional. So, how I was saying, we cannot process your refund at this very moment because the system doesn't consider the package as lost. We cannot cancel the order either since the carrier is closed since is late, so... 

KD: WELL MAKE THEM OPEN TO CANCEL THIS AND REFUND THE MONEY 

Me: I warned you so I will have to disconnect this call. I'll email you the process and you can contact us tomorrow or refuse the TV when arrives. Bye!

That time I had to call a call centre I used to work at ...,"... and ended up teaching the trainee how to use the system.

While at uni I had a part time job working at a credit card provider to make some beer money. It was not a fun job and consisted of about 50% being shouted at by customers for something they'd done wrong themselves, 25% being shouted at by customers for some system error on our end and 15% trying to fix stuff incompetent management had caused. I quit as soon as I finished unit and found something better. 

About 3 months after quitting I had to call the company up. I'd received a statement with a bill for about £500. I had a few problems with this. 1, I hadn't made any charges on the card. 2, I'd never been to Thailand where the charges had been placed and 3, I'd cancelled the card the moment I left the place.\* So I phoned up the company, waited on hold for about 15 minutes then got through to Tim, the customer service agent.  

The call started going downhill straight away.  One of the call centre policies was to never appear unsure or indecisive on a live line with a customer so if you had to check the manual or ask advice they preferred you to put a customer on hold.  Well I spent about two and a half minutes of the first four minutes of that conversation on hold and most of the rest of the time you could almost hear Tim slowly searching for something on the screen.  It was obvious this was a new recruit and another shining example of the companies training program. 

This is when I decided to be helpful.  I started giving Tim the Trainee hints.  I started off trying to be subtle, saying things like ""You should probably send a note to and investigation team"" when I noticed Tim missed doing it.  This didn't last long and I was soon talking him through the process step by step.    

I don't think poor Tim even realized what was happening until the very end when I asked him to say hello to my old boss.

Training never taught me how to handle filing compliments instead of complaints,"Obligatory mobile alert

Regular call, someone was struggling to apply for the Canadian pandemic help, so it took me like twenty minutes to get her to the website for unknown reasons, Google wasn't showing her the Canadian website's homepage as it normally should. Took at least ten minutes, but finally, we got her there. Then she asks me to stay on the line while she fills the application. I did. Plus, I could have to put up with a Karen or two in the time I'm spending with this nice lady. But as she's doing all the work, I am not really doing anything. I, at most, reworded and repeated about five instructions to assist her and then said ""yes"" when she asked if she had to hit the continue button.

The call was also kind of amusing. This older woman saying her tablet is slow, or ""thinking about life"" as she put it a few times, groaning at how long it takes to fill the application, saying she'll need a drink of ""something alcoholic"" when she's done, it amused me. Finally, after being on the phone for forty minutes, she finished it.

Then she was thanking me profusely, and asked if she could file a compliment to my manager. I had to double take that one, because I've expected getting complaints (and the one complaint I've reported wasn't even about me) and how to deal with that, but a lady to be so satisfied with me saying ""yes"" every ten minutes as she asked if she should hit the continue button when she was done after working basically everything out for herself.

I just obliged as I was kind of dumbfounded. I can't transfer calls, and technically don't have a ""manager"", but I just emailed my team leader about it because I still don't know if it should be the same protocol as complaints. I'll admit, I'm low key paranoid about sounding arrogant for informing my TL about it. I couldn't really forward specifics since I didn't get any, so I just gave my boss the gist of it and the info that the client gave me. But I'm glad she felt so helped.",111,0,0

Getting tired of it all...,"I am a supervisor and the program I am on deals with COBRA and active employee benefits. I have had so many takeovers lately because EVERYONE is backed up from us to carriers because of the sheer volume of people getting laid off and let go. On top of that, the company itself has let go of 90% of call center and 70% of staff, including eligibility processors. The stress on the remaining processors caused all but one to quit and handle 5 million cobra accounts. Needless to say, this has been a disaster. 

Agents are frustrated that we have 60-130+ queues, sups are constantly getting sup requests because people are pissed, people are pissed because they are waiting 5-6 hours in queue (and if it isn’t handled by close the system drops everybody) 

I did get one good call though. Member wasn’t active in cobra, but the hospital was going to reschedule his literally life saving operation and make him do chemo again if it wasn’t active by Friday. I needed a win, so I broke protocol. I had the agent make the case and then reached out directly. Processor said they were busy and would get to it eventually. There were 200 other “urgent” cases in front of that one.  She was frustrated and burnt out too. I told her my method of handling mass issues and address multiple issues by account. She got it approved by her sup and cleared out 50 cases in one hour. She felt energized and took care of the one I asked about immediately. Within 4 hours he was good to go. Most people had been waiting 10 days for what he got in 4 hours. The new method should help ALL cases go faster, but it does put more pressure on my agents as now they have to confirm completion instead of the processor. 

I let the i original agent call the person back and he cried, I cried, and the agent was on cloud 9. I needed that win. 

If you made it this far, how can I increase moral for my team? I can’t do that for everyone, and the queues will be here for a while. We are not on site or even all in the same state/country. I just want to give the agents a little happiness while we get pounded. Any ideas are welcome.

Being 24 and living at home doesn't make someone a minor,"Background: I work for a pretty famous health insurance company (so no, I really don't have a soul anymore). I work in the subrogation department, which recovers money for the health insurance if - say you get into a car accident and the hospital charges your health insurance instead of the car insurance like they're supposed to. I talk to people all day about medical billing. Being in the US, I *have* to abide by the HIPAA laws, which are federal laws that prevent your health information from being shared with anyone who isn't you. We try to call you first to confirm what happened because no one pays attention to their mail anymore. It's an automated system the dials out and if you answer, the call gets directed to us.

Now I've set up the background, I get a call that our automated system sent out. It pops up with some basic info: the patient's name, address, call back number, and what health insurance they have (private vs Medicaid/Medicare). 

Me: Thank you for calling. My name is kim\_ctv. Could I get your name please?

Caller: I'm *redacted's* mom.

M: Oh, is *redacted* available to speak with?

C: They are a minor.

M: My system is showing that they are 24...

C: Well, they still live at home.

M: Ok, are they available to speak with?

C: You can speak with me, I'm their mom.

M: No, I can't. The HIPAA laws are very specific. *Redacted* is an adult and I need their permission to speak with you.

C: But I'm their *mom*!!!

I'm sorry, I must've missed that clause in the HIPAA laws that repeating over and over that you are the parent of an adult makes it *totally* ok for me to disclose their personal health info. I sent the patient a letter so they can call back when they're home.

"Kevin 0, Call center 1","Story time. Last month a guy ""Kevin"" called our center (retirement plan administration) to take a withdrawal. (Pro tip: Don't be a dick to people who manage your money. Also, never call your bank drunk or high. It rarely ends well.)

He told the rep he wanted to withdraw as much money as possible.

A little bit of backstory here: When you withdraw from a tax-deferred account, there is tax witholding. Normally it's a flat 20% by law, but due to COVID the government lets you enter whatever percentage you want as long as it's not a single-digit nonzero number (complicated, yes, I know). In theory this is a boon to most people, but what the authors of the law failed to consider is that for far too many people, having to choose the percentage is VERY hard- TBH most people, secretly, would prefer the flat 20% is chosen for them, they can just make a dry joke about how taxes suck, and move on with their life. As it were, we end up trying to explain the difference between TAXES and WITHOLDING, til we are blue in the face, dozens of times a day. Invariably people ask us what percentage they should go with ""so they won't owe any taxes next year"", which obviously we have no way of knowing. But our man here, Kevin, was not ready to take this for an answer:

Kevin: ""LIQUIDATE MY ACCOUNT AND SEND ME ALL THE MONEY""

Rep: ""OK. What percentage of this are you witholding for Federal taxes, Kevin?""

Kevin: ""Whatever percentage that I don't owe anything on it! Hurry up already. Are you slow?""

Rep: ""You should talk to your tax advisor then. Regrettably we can't guess through the phone what tax rate you may end up being subject to next April"".

Kevin: ""CUT THE BS. You know exactly what tax rate to withold! I know you guys are trained on this so just take whatever percentage so I won't owe any taxes on this.""

Rep: ""The default is 10%, you can go with that if you're not sure.""

Kevin: ""Will I owe taxes then?""

Rep: ""Maybe. Talk to your tax advisor.""

Kevin: DAMMIT IS SAID CUT THE BS. I KNOW YOU KNOW THE ANSWER. PUT THE PERCENTAGE I NEED TO WITHOLD NOT TO OWE ANY TAXES"".

Rep: ""OK Kevin, no problem.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 2 weeks...

Kevin: ""I just got my check in the mail and it was for $0. What's going on?""

After looking into it, yep- the rep put ""100%"" for tax witholding. Kevin's entire retirement account was sent to the IRS. As you might imagine this one got escalated, and the sup told him to pound sand as he'd agreed to everything over the recorded line. The best part is the IRS already has his money, so there is literally nothing we can do to get it back to him. When the sup told him to talk to a tax advisor about his options, he hung up and we have not heard from him since.

Granted, Kevin did not have much in his ""retirement account"", but he learned a lesson about calling the bank after using meth.

&amp;#x200B;

EDITS:

Yes he explicitly agreed to it, we're not retarded. Only an excerpt of the conversation is written, as I didn't hear the rest of it.

The point of the story is he thought ""100%"" meant ""100% of the tax he owes"", rather than ""100% of the distribution"" and refused to be told otherwise.

Also, it sounds like a few people commenting here have worked with pensions and annuities, which are a whole different animal from the 401(a) plan Kevin had. Those products are still paper-based, and, as is the intent of that system, yes is is very hard to make stupid mistakes. As it were, 401(a), 403(b), and other private tax-deferred plans do not work this way. Heck, last year I closed my state pension- the stodgiest, most conservative retirement plan out there- and they took everything over the phone. No papers at all. In any event, the CARES act turned all of the usual rules on their head, leaving even old hands with spinning heads, which is the point of the post.

The good news on the ""newer"" ways of administering the account is that transactions happen fast. People can be reasonably certain of what NAV/WAP they'll get, and this reduced uncertainty is one of the things that makes people comfortable contributiing in the first place. As a 90's kid, if I had had to sell stock by mailing in a paper and waiting for the price to do God knows what over the next 2 weeks, I'd never invest in the first place.

The semi-bad side of this (for me, not the participants): Transactions happen so fast that people think a 401(k) is like a regular bank account- and get all bent out of shape that transactions take 3 days not 1. They call, like, the day before buying a car and are shocked we can't send a direct deposit during the phone call. But that's a good story for another post.",835,0,0
"I was having a good day, until Karen refused to fix her problems.","Title could really say it all, but honestly... I've been at this call center for around a year, been in the general work for longer, and this was the call that got me further on my nerves.

It was as if I was guessing, because my eyes zoomed to the little blurb left by the department that transferred her while I was greeting her.

Karen couldn't use her mobile data. She refused to talk to tech support, she refused any and all troubleshooting and just wanted to cancel her two phones (note: as far as I could tell from her ramblings, the problem was in one number). I try to talk to her, but she's all rage from the get go, flat out says she doesn't want to fix anything, she's done with my company, she's paying for something that's not there, we're failing her, her cellphone records everything, she just wants to get rid of us...

Seeing as the call was going nowhere, I said I'd go and get her numbers cancelled... And then I told her that since she had a binding contract ongoing, she'd have to pay nearly 200€ for each number as a penalty (it's 10€ for each remaining month).

When I tell you all hell broke loose... She screamed more than ever, she told me I could put the penalty up my mom's ass, said we were thieves, she said she was right, we were in the wrong, she had proof, she had witnesses, she wasn't going to pay anything, we could take her to court...

Honestly, anything I said set her off, she kept raging, me saying whether or not she paid was up to her made her angry, me saying she didn't *have* pay anything if she just tried to fix it first talking to tech suppprt, but she refused any and all attempts to help or diffuse the situation.

Then she had the nerve to ask why we were like this, saying she was a customer for so long, and I pointed out she refused any all help or fixing, which just set her off on her rant about she didn't want any help or to keep our services...

At the end, my own supervisor was telling me to just hang up, I'd told her everything, she was just going in circles (which I did point out to her), until I basically just told her the call was over, there was nothing else to discuss, and just transferred the call so he'd hang up.

Tier 2 is way easier than Tier 1. I just got promoted.,"I just got promoted. 

Tier one is exactly what it sounds. Password resets, trouble shooting, listening to people bitch, paperwork, and generally just dispo’ing calls and getting them to the right place. It’s calls that take an average of 15-20 mins to complete, and I took between 14-30 calls a day (longest calls could take up to two hours per call). 

Now, it’s 20 mins to lunch time, and I’ve taken 6 callers since 8am. I’ve had more time to play on my phone than work on my computer, and I can actually click those magic buttons callers always want clicked. We are also the escalations department, but I’d been deescalating my own calls before this promotion, so I’m quite pleasantly surprised at how easy this job actually is. 

I just clean up the mess that Tier 1 doesn’t have the buttons/security clearances to click. It’s that easy. 

The only risk in my new job? Ya know, messing up people’s taxes and financials. But other than that, I wonder why they hide the easy jobs for those who make it through the flames. I got my promotion in 4 months. I was ready to quit my job and go work in my preferred industry when I got promoted. This promotion is technically easier and pays $1/hr more. Can’t complain. Still hate call center work though. Hahaha",54,0,0
Creepy Caller,"Okay I just remembered this one. Kinda long

Like I mentioned before I used to do phone tech support in of course a call centre.

I am female and this guy calls in for help. I do what I can and it appears his modem is not working properly. So I suggest taking it in to nearest store and exchanging it.

No biggie simple enough. Then he wants to apparently chit chat about that. He lives next town over from where I worked. Let's call him John.
Me well me.

John: you must be really hot, you have a sexy voice

Me: umm okay, thank you???

John: where do you work?

Me: umm at a call centre in canada

John: which province? I bet your close by

Me: I am sorry sire due to safety and privacy I cannot disclose that

John: I bet you work in xyz town at certain call centre

Me: yup you got me

John: tell you what after I exchange modem I will swing by and pick you up for dinner

Tech Support,"So I used to do tech support for a major phone company that also supplied internet. Not a bad job, some great people. Oh the call centre went bankrupt a year after I left.

So I had a lady that in wanting to set up her internet. I pull up her account and start asking the normal questions. What type of computer and stuff. Told me she had a windows system.

We go through the steps and it was painful. Nothing seemed to work. She could not understand stuff, could not get modem working. 

So I ask a few more questions, turns out she had a Mac computer and her cat had peed on modem! Oh and never used a mac before, ever. Just bought last week and left in box.

You people should keep track on if I use my subscription or not!,"So I work call-center / Customer Service for my country's biggest train company where the majority of trains that ride are from our network.

To encourage people to travel with the trains and to make it easier, cheaper and spread people out a little more we also give different kinds of subscriptions so people can get discounts or travel for free during certain hours with not just our trains but also trains from other companies.

Most people like this and because of that many have some kind of subscription where they pay a certain amount of money for every year or month, depending on what subscription they have and how they set it up.

Now due to Corona or Covid-19 it has been highly advised by the government to use public transportation as little as possible ever since March.

Because of this many people have canceled their subscriptions or taken smaller/cheaper ones so they aren't paying for nothing.

Understandable, right?

Well, some people thought that they'd keep it going for a while longer, see what happened and canceled it anyway later like in May.

Also understandable, right?

Well, some people also didn't do that and are calling just now to cancel their subscriptions and many get mad to realize we can't review that last few months that have passed in which they didn't use their subscription but it was still billed like a subscription does.

The reason we can't do this is because it's not allowed by the higher-ups due to it literally being the customers's own faults for not ending their subscriptions sooner.

Just yesterday I had one of these calls again.

To make it easier I'll be M and the customer who was a old man wil be OM.

M: Good afternoon, (train company's name), this is (my name) speaking! How can I help you?

OM: Yes, hello! I want to cancel my discount-subscription!

M: Alright, can I then please have your (list of contact info) so I can find your account?

OM: \*gives info\*

M: Great, I found your subscription! May I know why exactly you want to cancel it?

OM: Well because I haven't been able to travel at all because of that virus! The last time was back all the way in February!

M: Yes, if you don't use it I understand you don't want to pay for it. So I can stop it in a few days on (date, I don't remember which one exactly) and because I can see that you pay a yearly amount ahead, you will be getting money back for the period that is still to come.

OM: But what about all those months that passed?

M: I'm sorry sir but I can't do anything about that.

OM: WHAT?! Are you serious?! But I didn't even use it so why am I paying?!

M: Once again, I'm sorry sir but during those months your subscription kept going and if you didn't want to pay for it you should have stopped it sooner.

OM: But why do I even need to stop it myself?! Can't you people see right now that I didn't you it?!

M: Yes, we can see that now bu-

OM: Then why didn't you stop it?!

M: Sir-

OM: And I know it's not that you need the money from me because I know you have millions of people who keep theirs!

M: Sir, it's not-

OM: You should keep track on if I use my subscription or not and I should only pay then! This is plain thievery!

M: SIR! Sir, we can not keep track of every subscription and if it's being used or not! You just said it yourself, we have millions of subscriptions being used or not every day and it's impossible to keep track of all of them! Also, even if we could, we need a customer's vocal agreement to cancel a subscription due to the law! If we cancel a subscription without permission then we'd break the law! The best I can do for you is cancel your subscription right now so you will at least get *some* money back!

OM: Fine then!

After that I cancelled the subscription and gave him instructions on how everything would go and we hung up.

After that I had to rub my head for a solid minute to make the head-ache he caused stop.

Don’t want to talk to me? Ok!,"This was a few years ago. After about a year of being on phones in a call center, I found myself on the escalations team. In our center, escalations are transferred to this team, and managers only take them if escalating higher.

After about 2-3 weeks of taking escalations, I got my first “screamer.” Agent told me “sorry man, she wouldn’t even give me her name, she just started screaming.” I’d heard that before, but they always were nicer once talking to somebody they mistakenly thought had more power, so I confidently had him transfer her over.

“My name is fhornofvalere, and I’m a manager at Online Retailer. I was told you asked to speak to a manager?”

Caller: [unintelligible high pitched screaming]

Me: “I’m so sorry for whatever is going on, but I’m here to help. Could I get your name?”

Caller: “NO, I WON’T GIVE MY NAME” [more screaming]

Me: “Ok, again I am really sorry for whatever has happened. Do you have an order number I could reference so I can help you?”

Caller: [More screaming]

This went on for a little while longer, and my peers started to notice as they could hear her screaming from my headset. 

After trying a few times, she said “I don’t want to talk to you, BOY.”

Me: “OK.” Then I obliged by hanging up, for the first and only time ever.


Aftermath: I wrote my manager a novel since she’d likely hear about it. She listened to all 5 of her calls that day and pieces together that a stupid sales agent asked for her order number repeatedly when she clearly was asking for help to place a new order (odd since sales doesn’t even use order numbers, at all.) turns out her dad died the day before, and she was calm for the final agent who was not a boy.",68,0,0
[Rant] Now I know how Sam and Frodo felt on the way to Mordor,"Typing on mobile, sry for format snd spelling. 

tl;dr: Becoming a senior advisor and already dreading the entourage of Karens and Kevins. 

Finally couldn't escape the draft to becoming a senior advisor. I've been working for this company for 3 years. Normally, anyone who'd survive this long would be a lvl4 advisor by now. (To clarify, we have 4 tiers: L1 is mobile, L2 os computers, L3 is senior mobile and L4 is senior computers) Each tier gets its own calls as well as calls for the tiers below it.

Now, you're probably thinking: ""But, Okinage, a promotion means more money!"" except... It doesn't...

We work customer support. Now... There are dumb and I mean DUMB, customers in every brand, but even our trainers can attest that ours take the cake. As a L3 I was making decent money, especially since our bonus is 160 euros, and I mostly get it in full. We depend on our metrics, quality evaluations and customer satisfaction surveys.

As a senior advisor, however, I'm earning 60 euros more on my base pay and my bonus is slightly higher. Here's why I'm going to lose money, though: my responsibilites will involve following up on tough cases that need engineers to step in, providing appeasements to idiots, taking over calls from L1s and L2s that can't handle the customers or that already spent almost an hour being unable to resolve the issue, and unless it's a good advisor, I will be getting pissed customers who are fed up with it all.

As L2 I have been working on the best lob. I still get a lot of Karens and Kevins, but honestly? Computers are just techy enough for me to enjoy poking around. I actually felel like I solved something and the customers that are cool are honestly appreciative. I hate mobile because you do the same steps 90% of the time and it always boils down to restoring or repairing, and no matter how much you try to put in real effort, they always sigh and give you the eye-rolling tone of death. 

This also means that they are less likely to give me a satisfied survey as our customers are usually under the impression that ""I paid a ton of money so this shouldn't break, waaaah"" Karen... Even a damn Porsche will break if thr driver is as dumb as you, or just because sometimes technology is technology!

So, unless I'm consistently making 101 euros in bonus, every month, I'm legit losing money, working more, and ripping more hair with every call.

Maybe I'm just jaded and completely worn out after 3 years of putting up with people stupid enough to understand that sometimes tech will break and take a bit to repair.. Maybr I'm just sick of people in general and every second of this job wears out my remaining sanity that much more. Can't even quit because by my country's law, if I'm the one quitting, I do not have a right to receive unemployement allowance. 

I'm constantly looking for other jobs, and fingers crossed I'll get some replies come September. In the meantime, any senior advisors (aka managers) that want to share their stories?",12,0,0
"Took my first call today out of training, I did horribly and cried.","So my company has been training us for the past few weeks to prepare us to take calls. This includes mainly learning how to navigate the software used to track and ship orders and how to set up refunds. The software itself isn’t hard to navigate and theirs a lot to remember in what I consider a short amount of time. Up until today we haven’t learned ANYTHING about the phones. We never got into putting a customer on hold, transferring calls, going from offline and online, contacting vendors. Using the software dialer. I’m talking NOTHING. On Monday we were due to start taking calls and begin getting graded to see if we can pass on to the next stage. My trainer decides to have everyone take their first call today that’s ungraded so we can get our feet wet. She has what they consider “ mentors” on the floor that are supposed to help us  navigate the system if we need help, help take over if we mess up. I got the WORST mentor ever. The lady just sat their while I had the mentor on hold critiquing the whole system, she was getting frustrated with me, she kept wanting to put the customer  on hold. She had no idea what she was doing and didn’t know how to articulate that to me so she threw me under the bus. Then my customer decides that they’ve had enough and just wants the company to follow up with an email/chat. I completely understand. I tell her I’d be happy to send in that service request and have the correct team follow up with her. During the time I’m saying that my “mentor” is in the background speaking with another co-worker loudly exclaiming how “ I didn’t tell her to say all that, I said to put her on hold” you guys. I died inside. My customer heard all this. This whole time my mentor was no help in helping me contact the vendor to find out when the package needed to be shipped, she was no help in helping me transfer calls. I didn’t know how to use the dialer at all! Anyways, I felt so overwhelmed I wanted to run out and quit my job. I literally cried to my trainer after work and told her how embarrassed and upset I was with how the mentor handled coaching me and I cried on the drive home.

"COVID positive employee, Business as Usual","I just want to share that where I work at, an employee has been tested positive for covid and all they did was just disinfect the building and told us to where masks at all times and sanitise regularly. That's it. We were not even offered a work from home alternative because they say it's big risk since we're dealing with people's bank account information. I'm so appalled. Everyone is up and running like nothing serious happening, and if you even think about just not showing up to work at all you'll be hearing lectures from your higher ups. I think this industry is probably the worst at dealing with it's people *sigh*

Edit: we just heard from our local news that a call center agent died due to covid just few days ago, and our center is finally attemping to implement the WAH. News broke (this is a different call center btw) and apparently so many agents were tested positive and had to be quarantine. Our management was alerted because our center's name was mentioned on social media being one of the few who currently still has their employees onsite. Funny how it took someone literally dying before they could take action but I'm just glad they did and I hope this will eventually be implemented somehow",61,0,0

Customer wants to speak with the CEO,"I worked tech/account support at a large fintech company a couple years ago. You needed to be an active customer to call the support line (there was a code), but there was a sales line that people would sometimes find. I was in a small group that took the redirected support calls. It was a mix of people who were new and had questions, people who lost their code, and people who were banned for fraud and were not allowed to call in or have an account. This is paraphrased to what I can remember. 

Customer: Hello, I can’t access my account or money, what’s going on?

Me: Let me take a look at that for you, what’s your name? 

(He gives me some account info and I locate his profile. As suspected, he has been terminated. Policy now is to inform him and exit the call as soon as I’m able. )

Me: thank you for waiting, I’ve found your account. It appears your account has been terminated, please refer to your email for more information.

C: what email?? I never got an email?? What did I do wrong?

(I’m not allowed to say the reason for termination, since I’m not in charge of those decisions and we don’t want to help fraudsters gain info on how to avoid being caught, but looking at his account it was pretty clear it was money laundering. )

M: I am not able to see the reason for termination, as that is handled by our account services team. It looks like you received the email this morning, but I can have them send it to you again.

C: What does it say?

M: (reads email. It’s vague and mentions violation of terms of services). 

C: That’s ridiculous! Set up a new account for me.

M: You are welcome to try, but as the accounts are tied to your SSN, new accounts will also get banned.

C: This is crazy! I have a ton of money in there! You won’t give me my money! For no reason!

C: I wanna talk to your manager!

M: I am unable to transfer you to a manager. 

C: yes you will!

M: My supervisor has the same information I do. They will not be able to change anything.

C: Then I wanna talk to that account team!

M: They do not speak to customers, and they don’t have a phone line I can transfer you too.

C: What?! What kind of company doesn’t let you talk to them? There’s no way you can transfer me? Can’t you just walk over and talk to them.

(I absolutely can, or slack the guy that froze him, but I won’t.)

M: We don’t have an internal phone line. I have no way of transferring you, and it is against policy. Please refer to your email.

C: then I wanna talk to your boss!

M: as I said, the supervisor -

C: No! I wanna talk to CEO’s Name!

Don't joke about bringing a gun,"So this literally happened today. 

Rep = representative 
Garage = tow company 
Sup = supervisor 

I work for emergency roadside service as a dispatcher. Basically we deal with both members and tow companies after the member has placed the call and are waiting for service. 

Now, due to Rona we have been letting members know if they want to ride with the tow driver that they have to wear a mask. 

Well we had a customer call for a tow today. When the representative got to the part about asking if the member had a mask, the member said yes and made a comment about if not he'll just bring his gun or something along those lines.

If you don't already know, this is NOT something you joke about which the rep told him when he said he was just joking. Also, not sure whybhe thought it made a difference but he mentioned he was blind. 

So the rep put the call in after making sure to notate what he said. Well another dispatcher called the member back to clarify what he meant but the guy became argumentative and defensive about the situation and kept saying that if we don't want to send service that he doesn't need us and he has someone else that can do his tow. 

My coworker tried explaining that we want to send him service but want to ensure that the driver is not going into an unsafe situation. The guy was still defensive amd was saying that our company was ""soft"" just like the rest of the country. So after some deliberation it was determined that we were not going to send him service and send his account to escalations for review. We canceled his call and told him we weren't sending service. 

You'd think that would be the end of that but no. He ended up calling back and placing another call. I guess he thought that he was talking to the garage the whole time because he requested we send a different garage. 

We didn't catch his call right away but when we did I called him and explained that due to safety concerns we can't send him service and that his account had been sent to our escalations team for review and until they determine how tp proceed, we can't send him service. 

He started going on about how it was just a bad joke and we're making a bigger deal out of it.l ext ect. He also said he has 15 vehicles and we're not gonna have to service them anymore all that bull. I don't remember a lot of what he said but he did say he was going to sue us and the hung up after saying he's sorry we're not fully fledged Americans. 

FYI yes we are located in America so I thought it was a bit rich of him to say we're not American because we were taking his joke about bringing a gun to his service call seriously.",52,0,0

What do you mean I live in NYC??,"A few years back I was working for the state in a call center, specifically the personal income tax line. I ran into several versions of this story, but this was the best one. 

For background, the ole big apple is made out of 5 boroughs. Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx, and Staten Island. Each is their own county, and used to be independent but in 1898 they consolidated under one city charter. 

Now in NYC you get income taxed 3 ways, Federally, State, and there is also a resident NYC income tax. So if you live in NYC you have to pay income tax to the city. There is also a form you need to file with your taxes when you move out to tell them to STOP taxing you like you live in the city. We got lots of calls over this. I know this all a lot of background but I swear it gets funny. 

One day I get an irate caller that wanting to know why the FRENCH TOAST we assessed him NYC taxes? He doesn’t live in the city!! I apologize and ask if he lived in the city previously and moved, and maybe didn’t file the form letting us know when (happened all the time)

I wished I could glide over the tools without a second thought. I wished I knew exactly what to tell you. I did stumble. I no longer sounded confident. I was confused about why your question morphed as you began to complain about the length of the call.

Caller is going to 'rip off some heads',"I work customeer service for a hospital system, and take calls from people who want to pay their medical bills, update their listed insurance, apply for financial assistance, etc. And today i clocked in and literally the first call i got was some lady (who we will call Karen) calling in and demanding that we just completely erase $15,000 of debt that she had with the collection agency since 2018 for plastic surgery that was deemed ""not medically necessary"". I tried to explain that we wouldn't be able to do that because 1) the balance was no longer with the hospital and was in collections. 2) because of the amount and the nature of the services and 3) because she signed at the time of service saying she would be responsible for the cost and never paid it.

She doesnt listen to me at all. Instead she immediately starts cursing, yelling, and hurling insults at me. I warned her that if she continued to be disrespectful i would disconnect the call (which we are allowed to do at the call center i work at if callers are belligerent) and she demanded a manager, in true Karen fashion.

As I reached out to one of the reps in escaltions, i noticed the notes on her account. This lady had called in 3 times every day for the past week demanding the same thing, and one of the reps who she spoke with before even noted that she told them 'she'd call back the next day and rip some heads off then'.

Ive been working custoner service 5 years and I've had my share of angry callers but this one takes the cake due to the sheer dedication to being terrible.

Edit: the escalation rep just messaged me back. Turns out she had to hang up on the caller because she could not be civil. The caller kept throwing more foul language towards them, which i wont repeat here. Escalations just gave her an email address to send her complaints to but i doubt that will stop her from calling back again.",54,0,0
These huge cable companies are out of touch on reality,"I work for one of these huge companies. They have no grasp on why we are bleeding customers for TV services left and right. There are so many competitors out there now that are better and yet I have to sit in this stupid meeting about how we just need to convince people that spending money on an outdated product is best for them. No it’s not. Learn to compete with the market you have not the market you wish you had. People hate their bill going up each year, like despise it. They don’t need 200 channels, because they only watch 10 of them. So they cancel. And at the end of the day I can’t even blame them. 

So now my life just consists of answering back to back calls, praying that they don’t want to cancel their services but secretly agreeing with all of their reasons for doing so. This job is just so taxing.",843,0,0
Help Us Help You,"1. ""Darlene"" calls us to waive a late fee for her. I see the payment was made 12 days past her due date. 

Darlene: Can you waive my late fee? As you can see, we've (her and her husband) been with you a long time and we always pay on time. 

Me: \*sees there's two late fees on the account and sees the payment was made way past the due date\* I do want to let you know that you have another late fee on here.

Darlene: Oh...well I'm only asking you to waive one. 

Me: Was there any reason or circumstance to why you paid late? 

Darlene: No. The mail could've just been slow though. 

Me: When did you mail your check out? 

Darlene: On July 5 (4 days after the due date) 

Me: \*realizing any chance of me waiving the late fee without supervisor approval has disappeared\*...Just wanted to ask again, were there any circumstances to why you submitted your payment late?

Darlene: \*honest but not helping her case at all\* No. 

Me: Darlene, I'm sorry, but I can't waive your late fee. I see we already waived a late fee earlier in the year, your payment was 12 days late, and you told me you submitted your check after the due date. And because you advised me no extenuating circumstances, any attempt to waive the late fee would be denied. 

Darlene: \*getting cold toward me now\* That's a great way to treat a long standing client with your company. We've been with you for over 20 years now and you can't even waive one little fee for me? I don't care what you have to do, can you speak to somebody and get the fee waived if you can't?

Me: Darlene, I'm trying to assist you but you did not provide a valid reason to why we would override the late fee. 

Darlene: ...Well, I don't know what else to tell you. I didn't think waiving one late fee was such a big deal? 

End story: I was forced to speak to a supervisor and they gave me approval to waive the late fee for her as a special exception even though she was completely undeserving of the late fee waiver. 

2. Lisa wants me to open a dispute...with nothing to work with.

Lisa: Well can't you just put a date in there for me?

"“You’re you, and I’m me, and that’s that. Goodbye!”","I don’t work in a call center so I hope it’s okay for me to post here, because I think of this story frequently when I read your stories. I’m on mobile, so my apologies for any formatting issues and if I see them once I post this, I’ll come back and try to fix them.

I work in the billing department for a small hospital - all I do is post payments. Once in a while, someone mails in their credit card info and I will run the payment and post it to their account. For every twenty or so of those, one will have an issue and I’ll have to call the patient to get it resolved.

This is the story of the day I had to call Florence, who had neglected to include her card’s security code. It’s worth noting that I always give my name and the name of the hospital first - *always*.

*ring ring*

Florence: Hello?

Me: Hi, my name is jml7791 and I’m calling from -

Florence: Yes, you’re you, and I’m me, and that’s that. Goodbye!

*slams down phone*

It’s also worth noting that Florence is 87 years old and I freaking love old people because they do shit like this. 

You guys, I’m not good on the phones. I hate talking on the phone and one of the best things about my job is that I rarely have to. So this interaction gave me pause because I had to call this woman back and I didn’t know how to go about it so that she didn’t hang up on me again. But alas, all we can do in life is try, right? I did decide to change my opening tactic this time, tho.

*ring ring*

Florence: Hello?

Me: Is this Florence?

Florence: Yes ...

Me: Hi Florence, my name is jml7791 and I’m calling from Small Hospital.

Florence: Did you just call me a moment ago?

Me: I did.

Florence: Oh my God. I’m so sorry. I’m so embarrassed. I’m so sorry. 

As it turned out - and I’m sure this will come as no surprise to anyone - Florence was sick and tired of telemarketers, hence her initial reaction. When I pointed out that’s why I’d tried to identify myself at the start of the call - so she would know I wasn’t one - she said, “Well, dear, they all do that these days - especially the ladies.” I decided it wasn’t worth pointing out that she’d cut me off before I could actually say where I was calling from. lol

Florence turned out to be a super nice lady who explained that she doesn’t let calls go to her machine because she lives alone and due to COVID, she doesn’t want her family to worry if she doesn’t answer when they call to check on her. And she apologized to me 27 more times. :)

Anyway, it’s an anticlimactic story but it always makes me laugh when I think of it - I hope it makes you guys laugh, too.

Will Quality get me for lying?,"TL;DR at the end 


I work in customer service in the credit card company for a U.S. bank. It was early in the day and I was not yet jaded and demoralized. 

Me: Thank you for calling BigBank my name is OP, how can I make your day better? 

C: Hi OP! I would like to add some of my kids to be able to use my kids to be able to use my card. 

Verification... blah blah blah 

I add his kids and we have a fun conversation as we both have a lot (6) of kids in a short period of time. 

It was a bit of a long call because we were having a fun conversation. My stats are good and he’s not yelling at me, so all is good. 

I get all his stuff done and go to wrap up. 

Me: Besides adding your kids to the account, what else can I help you with? 

C: Hmmmm, well can you tell me why the sky is blue? 

Me: Oh, yes (in my most confident voice). The sky is blue because most of the earth is made up of water and the sun reflects off of it giving the illusion that the sky is blue. 

C: OMG! Are you serious? Is that true? 

Me: yes, absolutely, I majored in biology! 

C: Ok, do you know why concrete cracks? 

Me: Oh, of coarse. That is because of the water molecules that expand and contract during extreme hot and cold weather. 

C: For real? 

Me: Absolutely! Any other questions? 

C: No, my mind is blown. We should sit down and have a drink sometime so you can solve the rest of the mystery’s of the universe!

Worst person ever,"Worked for the Google Play Store at a call center. Graveyard shift - Pacific time so it was day time Australia and India. About 80% were Indian, 10% Australian, and 10% USA. 

This dude from the US called. Apparently his tablet updated without his permission and he was flipping out. He wanted to know exactly how much space it took. We’re tech support for androids and anything Google Play related, but not system related. I Google searched it, asked other employees, asked the only manager, couldn’t find any answer. 

He demanded one. I told him he’s not getting one. He hung up, called back immediately. We weren’t busy on graveyard shift so there’s usually enough workers not on the phone to get him passed around 40 people within a short time frame. He kept calling back and getting other people, getting the same answer (we all had a group chat and everyone was notified) and he just kept doing it. I got him about 25 times in an hour. 

He literally started calling, not saying anything, and just hanging up. He did it to annoy us. It got to where I got pissed and yelled, “look I know you don’t have a life and are bored and miserable, but stop fucking calling and move on with your life. You’re pathetic as fuck wasting all time on something we can’t change!” He wasn’t speaking, but by this point he was the only one calling and we memorized his number so we knew when it was him. Luckily I didn’t get in trouble, my manager actually laughed, but damn that was so annoying. It got to where he kept calling back, but when he heard it was me he’d hang up immediately so that’s funny. 

Are people really this bored with their lives?! So he kept calling for the last 6 hours of my shift and when I left, he kept calling for an additional 9 hours on top of that. He knew we couldn’t help, he just loved pissing us off.",490,0,0

Maybe don't expect regular updates on reports you haven't made,"I do tech support for an ISP. Customer opens up by asking to be ""transferred to reclamation"". This is before I have any information about who I am talking to, what their issue is or even if they are a customer. Already know it'll be a fun call.


It is technically impossible for me transfer someone to the reclamation department. If you want to speak with a manager about perceived wrong doing on the part of the company, I need to create a fault ticket connected to your contract, put you on hold, call up a manager, discuss possible solutions with them, get back on the call with you and if you don't accept any of the possible solutions to your issue I'll escalate the ticket and give you a time estimate to when someone from reclamation will call you. If the manager I speak with deem that your perceived issue is already being handled according to standard term and service agreements, they will rarely agree to talk to you. You can't just call to complain about shit.


I ask what the issue is so that I can help out.He says he called earlier in the morning due to a damaged fiber cable in his neighbourhood and was told he would receive updates about when the issue would be solved but it's been a few hours without any updates. Now, we don't sent updates on larger scale operations such as fiber breaks for several customers. If you report the issue you get an automated text message when the ticket is closed, but you won't be informed about complications or delays unless they directly relate to something you need to do, like unlock your gate. I explain this to the customer and apologise on behalf of my coworker for not making sure he'd understood the process of communication. If you've already reported it, you just have to wait.


This does not calm the guy down. He says there is no saved report because he didn't give out his ""personal information"" the first time he called but that it is still ""unacceptable"" to not receive updates on delays and he ""needs"" to complain about this to reclamation.


I explain the process of getting into contact with a manager but subtly suggest he take a chill pill and return when the issue is resolved for compensation because I know this is not a thing a manager could nor would do something about. It's how the system works and literally the first time I've heard someone have a problem with it. He says he wants to continue.


Me ""I'll do what I can to help you here. I need your customer number so that I can confirm the issue and report it.""


C ""WHY?""


Me ""... So that I can confirm the issue and report it.""


C ""WHY?""


Me ""You wished to speak with reclamation? In order to continue the process and possibly get you in contact with them I first need to create a ticket for your issue.""


C ""SO DO THAT THEN???""


Me ""Of course. I just need your customer number to begin.""


C ""WHAT IF I DON'T WANT TO GIVE MY INFORMATION OUT TO JUST ANYBODY?""


Me ""Then I can't do much to help you unfortunately.""


C ""That's just great! That's another thing I would like to complain about! Just transfer me already!""


Me ""I won't be able to that. If I am to help you I need to know which contract has an issue.""


C ""I ALREADY TOLD YOU WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS! WHY DO YOU NEED MY INFORMATION?""


This goes on for a few more minutes.

Callers from India wouldn’t even try because of their language barrier.,"So in a previous post, I said I worked for the Google Play Store for a year and a half. Graveyard shift in the west coast of US. 80% of the callers were in India, 10% were in Australia, 10% were in US. 

About 60% of the time when Indians would call, they’d immediately hang up the moment they heard an American on the line. They usually didn’t even bother trying because of the barrier. The ones that did try would end up frustrated after a while and usually hung up. It was rare when I’d be able to successfully help a member. You know it’s bad when you answer the phone:

“Thanks for calling the Google Play Store, my name’s Jessica. How can I help you?” 

And half way through you hear a sigh and a hang up. I always felt so bad they they didn’t have a department that could help them more. They have other languages, I’m surprised they didn’t have one for them. The calls were always short so it was cool because of that, but I’d always feel bad for making them feel so helpless.",42,0,0
"Faster than overnight, now!","Cardmember Boy Genius had attempted to dispute a charge in the app. His process resulted in him creating a security closure, which he did through the app. This put him without a card and this presented an inconvenience to him.

So I get the call and ... our app is stupid because he had to close his account. Uh huh. Why, why, why, waaahh, waaahh, waaahh. I volunteer to expedite him a card and he wants to know if he can get it quicker than overnight. I pull up my big girl panties and say, “how do you think that would happen, Mr. Schmuck? “  and he is able to peek through his blind rage to see that what he is asking is impossible.

Good Callers,"I'm no longer a CSR, thinking about getting back into it. But I had an experience the other day, I had to call a support line because something wasn't working, I was my usual pleasant self. I've always been this way, I was raised to be kind to every one. So when the CSR answered, I could immediately tell he was well, frustrated wouldn't began to describe his mood right then. I could tell it had been a day from  hell for him, so I kind of upped my game, and went from just respecting him, and being pleasant to actually trying to make him laugh.  

He kept saying, ""thank you for being so nice and understanding"". Then at the end of the call he was like ""Mr. Man, you don't know how much I appreciate you being so great, you have really made my day, I can't began to tell you what it means to me"", and he just kept going on about how it wasn't normal and in his 5 year career I was the first caller that had been nice to him.

Does no one understand we're in the middle of a pandemic?,"This call came in today, and after it was over I took the 5 seconds before the next call to honestly wonder about our survival as a species.
I work for a major appliance company, and I only sell the parts for those appliances. Because of covid I'm now working at home. From what I know our office is the only one that gets the mail-in offers we send out (automatically), to reorder water filters for refrigerators. Due to no one being in the office since the end of March, the department that handles those mail-ins haven't been able to process those orders, and we've been telling people this as they call in asking where their orders are.
We have a few people who are understanding and are fine with placing an order over the phone with a credit card. This one woman did not want to hear it. 
Me=ME Crazy lady who don't understand why nobody is in the office to process her mail-in order=CL

Me: Thank you for calling blah appliance parts. My name is blah, with whom am I speaking with today?

CL: Hi, I want to check on an order.

Me: Yes ma'am I can assist, do you have your order number?

CL: No, you people haven't sent me anything, I placed this order at the beginning of July and haven't received anything.

Me: Okay, well what phone number did you put on the order?

CL: I didn't put a phone number on it, it didn't ask. You people have my check I sent in, and I want to know where my filters are! 

*Realization Rainbow sprouts from my head

Me: Oh so this is a mail-in?

CL: *sighs Yes

Me: So unfortunately since we're on a work at home situation we're not able to process mail-in orders. At the moment the only way we can put in those orders is over the phone with a credit card.

CL: I'm not giving you my credit card! Why didn't the flyer say that? If you're not going to send out my filters then send me my check back!

Me: Unfortunately ma'am there's no one at the office that can do that, you would have to wait until the office opens up for them to do that.

CL: When would that be? And how is it they're not at the office, but I'm still getting these flyers!?

Me: I'm not sure ma'am. Those flyers are sent out automatically.

CL: This is just bad business! And what do you mean automatically, someone has to put it in the envelope and send it out. You know what just send me my check back, and take me off your mailing list. This is ridiculous. I'm never buying another blah appliance again!

In her little fit of rage, she hung up so I didn't get her information to either take her off the mailing list, or send any information to the mail-in team to send her check back when they got the chance to.
Like I don't understand how people can be so dense, we're in the middle of a pandemic! Mail is slow, warehouses are short staffed, and yes some places are not able to run at full capacity. Nobody is going to go to the office and dig through months of old mail to find your order and process it.

'I think you'll find that you owe me money',"Got a call the other week from a really nice customer. I'm customer service for an energy firm in the UK.

C- yeah I'm calling for a refund on the credit on my account. Should be about £300 there.

M - Well sir you are in fact in debit as of your last bill. You have smart meters fitted so we are billing you for exactly what you use as well.

C - well I spoke to someone a few weeks ago and they said I'm £400 in credit

M - looking at your bills, you've never been that amount in credit. You've actually been in debit alot.

I checked the previous call notes and there was no mention of this credit amount.

C - no, based on what that woman said to me a few week ago, by my calculations, YOU owe ME £300. So get it refunded now.

M - I'm not going to refund you for an amount that isn't in your account sir, plus, if I told you you had 1 million in the bank, are you gunna take my word for it and spend stupidly, or check it yourself first?

C - I see what you mean but I haven't been able to get my bills cause they're online and my account is locked.

M - and did you not let us know if the issue to fix it?

C - well no why do I need to?

Stupidity ensued for the rest of the conversation as this guy swore blind he was due a £3/400 refund. Towards the end of the call was my favourite bit.

C - well I'm gunna take this complaint to the regulator and you will give me my refund

M - ok

C- are you not gunna try stop me? You'll lose your job mate

FD apologizes for bothering me after I repeatedly tell him that he can't call employee's personal phone numbers. I know I should have hung up, but I feel like he would have likely complained and I would have gotten in trouble. 

I spoke to leadership about it, unfortunately there's nothing they can do...so that'll suck a lot if FD attempts to dox me or something. 

I know, very anti-climactic story, but I've never had a customer with a company I've worked for FIND my phone number and think that it's remotely acceptable to call and then demand technical support.",60,0,0

Here's All My Significant Life Stories. Thank you for your help!,"So I just had the most confusing call I think I've ever received. Even outside of work. (Obligatory mobile alert)

Got a call, start with my usual ""OP speaking, how may I help you?"" bit. My client was talking about her situation, but kind of repeating herself. Saying something along the lines of ""I'm on the benefit, and I'm pregnant, and I'm [so many months] pregnant, and I'm receiving the benefit."" So she asks about  who to talk to, and I give her a number to talk to an agent who can actually give personal help.

She says she's seen so many numbers and it's stressful, which is fair. To which she then starts telling me about her benefit and pregnancy again, then gives me numbers that she knows because of all these things she's going to do. 

Keep in mind, she sounded like she was still explaining her situation, not just making commemtary on the numbers. She knows [this number] because she's going to go sing for this event in front of the Prime Minister, she knows [that number] because of the fact that she'll be traveling to London and Toronto to talk something about residential school surviver, then she'll be going to a medal or badge of some sort, back to the baby and pregnancy, she's had health issues regarding a car crash and I think something else happened with that, she suffers amnesia because of a concussion, she's a widowed, single mother who's pregnant, and she has something in relation to her grandmother or great grandmother (can't remember which she said), Queen Elizabeth II. Then she said ""thank you for the help"" and hung up.

I don't know what to make of that. I am just thoroughly confused, and I don't know what in that speech of hers was true or not. But she wasn't like a Karen, it wasn't her trying to manipulate me or get things from me, it was just odd, and I feel bad for her. I don't know what to make on her concussion/amnesia comment given everything else she said, but I think she's struggling with something... But that was definitely the most interesting call of my day.

EDIT: Just told the story to my mom. She theorizes that the lady was on drugs.",13,0,0
Higher up Mix Up,"So I work in the Resolutions Departement, handling issues that vary from “my item came missing” and “I didn’t get my Gift Card for the promo”. One day I had a customer call in saying she got an e-mail telling her about a hush hush deal if she were to buy a gift card and then send them the number. She called in asking to see what can be done, as per floor support I told the customer that I can create a file requesting that the card be cancelled and then refunded. The customer accepted.

A few days later, I get a message from my team leader saying to call back the customer. I looked at the file again to see if, after our discussion, there was any updates. I see in the file it was written “We will not refund the customer”, “Resolutions will call with alternatives” and my team leader is telling me to refund. I ask her (just to confirm) what the final verdict is as I’m getting 3 different results. She then proceeds to tell me that I just have to call. I tell her again I don’t understand what I have to tell the customer since the newer notes are giving contradicting information. She then proceeds to tell me how she is done arguing and I didn’t read the file (which I did). Also a few minutes later, I get an e-mail saying how my notes from the first time we spoke to the customer were unstructured and unclear. I asked them what they thought was unclear as to me it was VERY clear.

They told me that my usage of the word “Hoax” (despite the notes also including what the hoax was literally right after the word) and also “hush-hush” (I was quoting the customer, however for this one I’ll give it to them). I explained to them exactly what was written, however they wanted nothing of it and my team leader messages me AGAIN to call the customer but will still not give a clear answer as to what I have to do or say. Simply telling me that the company would not want me to call for nothing (despite NO ONE giving me a clear answer).

The next day I see my Team Leader sent an email telling other team leaders to watch me to make sure I call the customer. I went into our chat (we have a TEAMS server) and asked if someone from floor support could help me since I was STILL unclear on what to do and needed help. I got someone and he told me that, despite it being unorthodox, we could refund the customer. So I called her and told her the good news. She didn’t answer so I left two voicemails. Me, finally happy I got this call out of the way, replied to the e-mail saying that thanks to someone finally telling me what can be done I finished the call. 

The nightmare continues...the next (yesterday in case anyone is wondering) I get a e-mail from security and a team leader, telling me to call back the customer to tell them we WERENT going to refund them AND to update my notes so it says the correct information (their exact words by the way). I told them that this made no sense as from the beginning I had been asking for clarification on what can be done and I had never originally received it so I had to look into it myself as I was told to simply call. The team leader who sent the e-mail then replied saying “(gonna paraphrase here) Oh! I believe I see where the confusion started, we told you we weren’t gonna refund the customer but the notes made it confusing since the info said we would have alternatives”. I told him that was not true as, again, my team leader had never told me what could be done, but rather to call (despite me telling her I have no idea on what to say). My Team leader then replied to the team leader’s email with a copy paste of the new team leader’s e-mail in bright red. However instead of clicking reply (to me), she clicked Reply all, effectively sending her copy-paste to 5 Departement team leaders.

So for 3 days I simply got screwed by multiple people and then got thrown (metaphorically) under the bus when it was wrong. I called her back again (for the 3rd time) telling we wouldn’t refund her and got lucky since it was a voicemail, but now I’m dreading to see another e-mail again telling me to change the information....

I won’t reveal them here (clearly lol) but I have screenshots of my chat with my team leader and the e-mails showing that from the beginning they were simply telling me to do something even they had no idea what to do, just so they could go “YOU screwed up big time”. Like a (extreme) example I use when people as me to describe my time so far (ever since COVID-19 hit) working at this call center is “They break your leg, and then punish you by breaking your other leg because your first leg is broken”. At the beginning it wasn’t too bad, simply just your usual Karens and Customers who wanted 19988658$ because a 20$ plant pot didn’t show up, but now it’s insane...Customers will verbally abuse you for up to 2 hours others will call just to complain about and say you didn’t want to help (despite you giving them options that normally would get you in trouble). Now I feel like even the higher ups are trying to either make me want to quit or fire me themselves by inventing excuses... Ok well thanks for reading this, I simply had to get it out but now is the time where you throw away your pop corn and I gotta go work 😉 Remember to tip your waitress and I am outta here.",30,0,0
Ghosts?,"Quick backstory - I work for a company that assists with utility connections when people move home, and our customers regularly call us for anything and everything to do with their house, so we're always referring them back to the real estate agencies.  
Customer: ""Yeah hi, I lost my keys a few weeks ago so I can't lock my front door, and every time I go out, I come home and my front door is wide open. Can you send someone out to check if it's ghosts?""

Me: ""Umm...Ghosts?""

Customer: ""Ghosts, spooks, poltergeists... you know, ghosts!""

Me: ""Are you sure someone else isn't entering your property?""

Customer: ""Well I don't think so because I never see anyone try to enter while I'm at home, so it must be ghosts"" 

Me: ""Well umm... I'm sorry but we can't assist with that, unless your meter box is haunted and affecting your power bill then we can get someone out to take a look, ha-ha. Otherwise, you'll have to call your agent about your keys and the ghost problem.""

A question for my fellow inbound call center reps,"I'm wondering how much time between calls you get. For the mid-size credit union I work for, we have 5 seconds between calls. We don't pick up, it beeps and it goes.

I am stuck constantly feeling like ""I just need a minute."" but that easily turns in to 3, in to 8, in to 20.

Burnout is eating me alive, and I'm dreaming about places where I can take a sip of water between calls and actually be able to swallow it before going in to my greeting.

/edit

I can, of course, change my status for follow up, or for personal breaks. It is very easy to abuse that system, and ... boy, I do. I just wish I didn't have to. At my company, we are supposed to be on calls 85% of the time. The other 15% is for follow up or breaks. V exhausting, personally.",78,0,0
Mary gets naughty.,"So, I posted my [first story about Mary](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/i1mrzu/the_time_the_bank_became_a_fast_food_help_line/) last night.  I know it isn't long since I last posted, but I wanted to share another tale about the sweet and crazy old lady.

If you haven't read the other one, I worked in the call center of a small, local, bank and Mary was one of my regular customers.  She was an elderly, widowed, woman who would only speak to me when she called.

Now, one day I received a pretty standard call from Mary.  She wanted to check her bank balance, see if her great-grandson had cashed the $15 birthday check she had sent him, and just chat for a bit.  It was a slow day and Mary was a wonderful person, so I didn't mind just chatting for a few minutes.  I had no other calls waiting and, thankfully, my boss was cool with us giving a personal touch to calls if it kept long-time customers happy.

I finished the normal bank-related part of the call when Mary hit me with this:

Mary: Did I ever tell you, Onyx, that my sister was also my sister-in-law?

Me: No, Mary, I don't think you ever did.  How did that happen?

Mary:  Well, you see, I married 'George' and then, a few years later, my younger sister married George's younger brother!  So, she was my sister *and* my sister-in-law.  Isn't that wonderful?

Me: That's great, Mary!  I'll bet you two had a lot of fun with that.

Mary: Oh, we did!  In fact, their first date was a double-date with me and George when we were still engaged.

Me: That had to be a good time.

Mary: It was.  Went to the drive-in movies.  I used to love drive-ins.  But, you know what?  While me and George sat in the front, 'Ted' and my sister...the little hussy...were getting it on in the backseat!

Me: Oh...oh my.  That had to be awkward.

Mary: It was!  I told George 'if you think I'm going to do that with you, then you have it all wrong.  I'm going to be a virgin when we get married, God dammit!'

Me: *laughs*

Mary: You know what my sister told me?  She told me that Ted gave it to her up the butt!  Can you imagine?! 

Me: *laughing very hard* Oh no!

Mary:  I know!  She was always a little floozy.  I tried it in the butt once, didn't like it.  Well, I have to go now.  You take care, Onyx.

With that pronouncement, Mary hung up.  I think about this woman a lot.  In my years working retail and banking, I never had a customer quite like her.",1027,1,0
There is no strip club here...,"Hey there, would like to share a funny short story.   So I work for a fruity tech company, I am not sure why, but somehow, I think NSFW calls get routed to me most of the time.


So I got this caller calling somewhat outraged and amused at the same time. He said that his house and that the built in Maps App displayed his property as a strip club. Getting paranoid about this as he apparently shared his address to someone and he never did noticed until someone told him about it just now and apparently he was sharing it to a lot of people before he took note of it.


My manager overheard my probing questions,  ""was there ever a strip club here?"" ""Are you sure dont really have a strip club business?""

Dear customer was paranoid about the cops busting in his place to search for hookers and now and how he cannot share the address to people now and might get the wrong idea that he runs a sleazy business and lots of various things.

Anyway I did a research and turns out it is something a T1 cannot solve, escalated it to a T2, he was also laughing his ass off but he'll get it sorted out.

Tldr: guys property shows up in maps as a [sleazy strip club name] and wants to get it fixed aa fast as he can as he is super paranoid the cops are going to break in to his property for being a strip club.",105,0,0
The time the bank became a fast food help line and caused an old woman pain.,"Hello, all.  I just found this sub and have spent the last two hours reading posts.  I am no longer a call center rep.  However, I was one for quite a while many years ago.

So, on to my tale...

I worked, at the time, in the call center of a small, local, bank.  To give you an idea of what I mean by ""small,"" there were only 10 of us in the entire call center (including my boss).  Because of this, and because the bank only had about a dozen locations in total, the call center reps all ended up getting a handful of regular customers.  Someone would call in and request a specific rep to handle their call.  For a small bank, that's no big deal.

One of my customers, who would only talk to me (for some reason or another), was an elderly woman I'll call ""Mary.""  Mary was sweet, retired, widowed, and approaching 80 years-old.  She lived alone and, I think, used the times she called in to the bank as a social outlet.

One evening, I see her number pop up on my screen.  I had talked to her enough that I recognized her number on sight.  I smiled, because Mary was always pleasant...if a bit weird.

Me: Thank you for calling [Local Bank], this is Onyx_Owl, how can I help you today?

Mary: Oh, good!  It's you, Onyx.  I am so happy it's you!

Me (already pulling up her account): How are you tonight, Mary?  Everything okay?

Mary: Oh, yes, dear.  Everything is fine.  I just need to know how much is in my account.  You see, I really want nuggets.

Me: Excuse me?  Nuggets?

Mary: Nuggets, yes.  My neighbor is going to take me to [Fast Food Place]!  I haven't had chicken nuggets in so long.  I love them with sweet and sour sauce!

Me: Well, you have [low balance, under $10] in your account right now.

*Note: Mary lived off of social security and this call happened a day or two before her next check would be deposited.  Sadly, getting under $10 was normal.  It broke my heart, but that's another conversation altogether.*

Mary: Oh, dear.  I didn't know I was that low.  How much do chicken nuggets cost, honey?

Me: I'm afraid I don't know, Mary.  I would guess a full meal would be about six to eight dollars.

Mary: Well, I don't want the full meal, just the nuggets.  Could you find out for me?

Normally, looking up fast food prices for a customer would be *well* outside my job responsibilities.  But, when you're asked by a 80 year-old to help her find out the price of chicken nuggets, you just have to go along with it.  My call center, though, had an insanely restricted internet.  We could access our company website, sites for the federal reserve, Kelley Blue Book, and other such sites.  Fast food places were NOT whitelisted.  So, I placed her on hold and called over to the [Fast Food Place] that was nearest her address (after looking it up in a phone book).  A few minutes later, I was back with her.

Me: Mary, it looks like an order of ten chicken nuggets is [whatever price...like three to four dollars].

Mary: Wonderful!  Thank you so much, dear!  Have a good night!

Now, if this situation had ended here, I would have just smiled and gone on with my life happy that I helped a sweet octogenarian find nugget nirvana.  But, it continued the following afternoon.

Me: Thank you for calling [Local Bank], this is Onyx_Owl, how can I help you today?

Mary: Honey, I'm so glad it's you.

Me: Are you alright, Mary?  You're not sounding too good.

What Mary said next is indelibly burned into my brain.  

Mary: Oh, I'm not good, Onyx.  The chicken nuggets gave me the shits.

Me: The...oh...I'm sorry...I...

I stuttered for a moment, unsure of what to say to that comment.  I've never had an old woman tell me about gastrointestinal problems before.

Mary: It was awful, Onyx!  I was up half the night with my ass glued to the toilet.  Oh, dear, I haven't had diarrhea like that in ages.

Me: *stunned silence*

Mary: I know it's not your fault, honey.  But, I wanted you to know that the [Fast Food Place] on [Road] has very bad chicken nuggets.  Since you helped me, I wanted you to know not to eat there.  I don't want you to get the shits, too.

Me: Oh...umm...okay.  Thank you for the warning.

Mary: You're welcome, honey.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to the bathroom.

Mary hung up and I, a bit flabbergasted, took myself out of the queue for a few minutes in order to process what just happened.  Mary called back many more times in the years I worked there.  Thankfully, that was the only time I heard about her pooping problems.  I did hear *many* other bizarre and inappropriate things from Mary, but that was the only bathroom-related one...thank God.",938,0,0
My last day working call centers is today!!!!!!!,"I've been in tech support via a call centers for 9 years now and today is my last shift!  I've been at my current company for 5 years, prior to that I was Music/Software/Media/Kindle support at Amazon. My last day being today brought back a fond memory of my last day at Amazon.

This customer had been calling in about software they bought thru Amazon and was having issues on how to use it on their computer.  Dozens and dozens of calls to us, several Lead escalations and constantly being told to call the software company, but she never listens. I'll call her Nancy.

Me: Amazon intro spiel

Nancy: I can't get *abc* software to work on my computer.

Me: What did *abc* company say when you called them?

Nancy: I haven't called them.

Me: Why not?

Nancy: (ignores my question) How are you going to help me with this or are you finally going to refund?

Me: (already having read all notes, emails, escalations to see it's not something refundable, not an issue with compatibility, but either a user error or she regretted it and was trying to play us for a refund) Nancy, we've been thru this with you at least 20 times. This is not an Amazon issue, we didn't make this software and only the *abc* software developers can help you with how to use it. I see we emailed and told you their contact information at least a dozen times, too.

Nancy: I don't want to call them.

Me: I don't care if you want to or not. That is your option, this isn't an Amazon product, we aren't trained on how it works and we will not be helping you with this anymore.

Nancy: (oddly still calm and sounding very sweet). It won't work, they won't help me.

Me; (Knowing full and well from experience and the *abc* software website they do help) You just told me you had not contacted them. You just need to call them like you have called us multiple times a day for the last several days. If you just call them instead you'd be properly helped by now.

Nancy: I want to talk to your superior right now. (still calm and sounding very sweet)

Me: No. Nancy that will do nothing for you. You have talked to them at least 5 times and have been told the same thing by them. They also emailed you saying we cannot help, you must call the software developer. I am not going to waste their time when we have given you the right solution.

Nancy: Get them to me now. (now she was actually sounding angry).

Me: Nancy, stop wasting our time. Stop wasting my time. Stop wasting my coworkers time. I don't know why you are being so difficult. Listen to me carefully THIS...IS....NOT...AN....AMAZON...ISSUE. Do you understand that?

Nancy: Yes. (Back to her calm self)

Me: OK then. Call *abc* software for help now.

Nancy: But I want Amazon to help me, are you sure I cannot talk to someone else?

Me: (bangs head on desk) No, Nancy. We are done. I've left final notes and we will not answer your calls about this anymore. (total lie, but maybe it would work) Do you understand this?

Nancy: Yes.

Me: Good. Now go call the software company like we told you to. (and I hung up)

I wish I knew if she actually listened to me or not. It felt cathartic to do this.",445,0,0
The Case of the Entitled Snob,"This was pre-pandemic, just to get that out of the way. 

I work in the reservations office at a northern Vermont ski resort. Or rather, I would, if not for the current situation. There’s a snowmobile company just down the mountain from us. We mention their presence on our activities page as a courtesy. That being said, we are not associated with them in any way, shape, form or fashion. Now, are you sitting comfortably? Then onto the tale!

(Ring ring)

Me: Good evening, thank you for calling (my office), this is MazdaValiant, how may I be of service?

Thick-headed Rich Guy: Good evening, I’m calling about this snowmobiling company. Can I reserve a time for that?

Me: That’s something you’d have to call the snowmobile company about, since they’re not affiliated with us in any way. In any case, they unfortunately are not doing it this year due to extenuating circumstances. 

TRG: Then I need you to cancel my reservation for a full refund. 

Me: Do you have your reservation number?

TRG: (gives me his reservation number)

Me: Unfortunately, I cannot refund the deposit on this reservation because we are within the cancellation policy, which states that the deposit is non-refundable within two weeks of the reservation. 

(We tell this to EVERYONE who makes a reservation at our resort. It’s written in our confirmation e-mail too)

TRG: Unacceptable. I’ve already spent a lot of money at your resort, so you’re going to do something about it if you want to keep your job. 

Me: I understand, sir, but again, the snowmobile company is not affiliated with us in any way. As we are within the cancellation policy, there’s physically nothing I can do. 

TRG: But you advertise them on your website!

Me: We only do that as a courtesy, it’s just so that people know they exist. Beyond that, we at the resort bear no responsibility. 

TRG: I don’t think you’re hearing me. You promised snowmobiling this winter, but now you’re telling me it’s not possible. So I’m telling you again to refund my deposit and cancel my reservation. 

(For the record, I’ve combed our website numerous times, and NOWHERE on it does it say snowmobiling is absolutely guaranteed any given year. Again, that’s entirely the snowmobile company, not us)

Me: Again, the snowmobile company is not affiliated with us. I could transfer you to Activities and they could arrange snowboarding...

TRG, interrupting me: NO WAY, you asshole! My son is graduating high school this year, and I promised him we’d go snowmobiling! Now you’re telling me it’s not happening. That’s YOUR fault. Now refund my money or get me a supervisor!

Me, trying to tamp down my indignation: All we do is mention them on our website. That does not mean we are responsible for their operations. As to a supervisor, we actually don’t have one on duty at the moment. She’ll be here in the morning. 

(And I give him my supervisor’s contact information)

TRG: She’s going to hear about how unhelpful you’ve been. What’s your name?

Me: My name is MazdaValiant. 

TRG: Get ready to kiss your job goodbye! (Click)

After that, I e-mail my supervisor about how this jerk has treated me on the phone because I wouldn’t violate company policy. 

Fast-forward to the next afternoon. As I’m coming in to the office, she asks to see me privately. At that point, I was sure I was about to get dressed down. 

S: I dealt with that gentleman this morning. He was the kind who thinks he can get everything he wants just by throwing money around. 

Me, surprised: Absolutely. He was being quite a jerk to me last night. 

S: Don’t worry about it, MazdaValiant. You handled it perfectly. He canceled his reservation, and he’s not getting the refund. 

Me: That’s good. Thanks for the backup. 

S: No problem! Policy is policy. 

She is easily my favorite supervisor ever!",116,0,0
Customer accuses me of being part of an Illegal Cartel,"This one goes back a few years when I was working a customer correspondence, and nothing has come close to this tale of crazy. It's another tale linked to my  now previous employed in the energy industry.

The customer had raised this complaint before, it had been dealt with and closed as the customer would stop contacting us but every so often, you'd get a new letter. The letters were very colourful and would accuse water companies, the police, the government and would also name drop people the customer had spoken to at the energy company as being part of a Mafia syndicate.

Just my luck that I picked up this customers most recent ramblings where they accused us of stealing the gas meter whilst they were in Africa. The gas meter was removed due to a large debt, no payments and a semi-derelict property.

On this fateful morning, I had the joy of calling the customer

Me: ""Hello, is that Mr Customer?""

C: ""Who is calling?""

Me: ""My name is Careful\_Garden and I'm calling to discuss your letter about your gas account?""

C: ""YOU STOLE MY GAS METER, BRING IT BACK NOW! GOD TELLS YOU TO BRING IT TO ME""

Me: ""I'm happy to discuss this with further once we've gone through Data Security""

Some how, we managed to get through the formalities of confirming identities before he realised I share a name with someone he'd name dropped in his letter as part of being the Mafia syndicate

C: ""ARE YOU  ""XX XX"" AS THEY ARE PART OF THE MAFIA?""

Me: ""I can assure you that whilst we have the same forename, we're different people and I can assure you I'm not part of the Mafia. I just want to see what we can do for you about your gas as you want a meter back in""

C: ""YES, WHEN WILL YOU BRING ME THE METER?""

The customer did shout constantly on the call so the caps are to emphasise his volume. 

Me: ""When we took the meter out, there was a bill of £xxxx.xx which needs to be settled. If you can.....""

C: ""NO, THAT'S NOT MY BILL. I WASN'T HERE. YOUR ENGINEER IS IN THE MAFIA AND IS LYING""

Me: ""I was going to say, if you could pay a third of the balance then we can look to put a meter back in for you""

C: ""NO, YOUR ENGINEER IS LYING AND THE MAFIA ARE RUINING MY LIFE""

Me: ""I can assure you that the engineer who took the meter out confirmed the reading to bill you for the gas used plus there are warrant charges as well""

C: ""WARRANT CHARGES? THE MAFIA WERE IN MY HOUSE? THE POLICE ARE THE MAFIA""

Me: ""The court granted us access to inspect and remove the meter but in this instance, the Police were not at your property. For us to help you get the meter back, what could you pay today?""

At this point, the customers volume rose again and there was loud rambling noises on the phone before the customer hung up. Standard business practice, we call customers back if the line drops....

Me: ""Hello, it's Careful\_Gar""

C: ""DON'T CALL ME BACK AGAIN, I HAVE PUT A CURSE ON YOU""

And the line dropped again.

From here, the customer continued to write in and my name was included as part of the Mafia syndicate alongside, the police, the government and the waters companies. The customer was referred internally to a specialist team to manage which looking back should have been done a lot earlier than my referral. 

He continued to argue about his gas meter, which never got returned with this specialist team for another 12 months before he gave up the property and letters then stopped as he was no longer a customer.

TL;DR - Customer thought I was part of the Mafia and put a curse on me as he had no gas meter.",21,0,0

MSPH: Hi sweetheart. I have a really bad situation, can you help me?

Me: I’m going to do my best. 

MSPH: *jumps into horrible story of sibling, parent, child loss. Job loss. Identity theft. Has never held a job bc she has a non profit. Female welder. Volunteers putting kids in monster trucks that she works in.* 

Me: *end of the day napping* wow! That is really incredible. 

MSPH: yes, but now I have cancer and have a stay at home order due to Covid. 

Me: so these are our options. You are on a cancellation notice and at the end of our 2 week grace period. If you do not pay by tonight we can not extend anymore. It’s $65 what can we do to pay this? Friends? Family?

MSPH: Sweetie, thank you so much for thinking of me but I’ve begged on my knees for help here. I have no one any more. If there’s nothing else you can do I understand. I wish I could adopt you. You are so caring and sweet. I bet your parents are so proud of you. 

Me: *holding back tears of daddy issues* Youre so welcome MSPH. I wish there was more I could do for you. 

MSPH: you did everything you could. I will come back to your company and pay everything back when I can start making regular payments again. 

*sign off and hang up* 

Guys, I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t help her. I went out on my lunch break and bought a visa gift card, paid her bill on my personal laptop in incognito, and called her back. 

Me: Hi. MSPH, I am so glad I caught you. I just wanted to let you know your Insurance Co bill is no longer going to cancel and you will be good for another month. 

MSPH: OH! When will Insurance Co ask me to pay it back? 

Me: I’m seeing your policy was paid for by an anonymous donor. There will be no amount to pay back to Insurance Co. 

MSPH: *crying* bless this world we live in. If the donor calls in thank them for me. 

Me: will do. Now let’s get this bill down for the  future. 

I managed to miraculously pull a rate of $5/mo out of my ass. It required a lot of paperwork with her state that she will need to do and she won’t be able to drive her car at all until she puts coverages back on but she won’t get her license suspended in her state for a lapse of coverage. (When the insurance is canceled in her state and she still have the license plates, her license gets suspended and she gets fined) 

I know I shouldn’t have gone so far but I couldn’t let this woman down and she was never once entitled or rude. She was a sweet angel who took responsibility for her own insurance and was going to come back when she could.",60,0,0

GET ME YOUR SUPERVISOR!,"We've all had these calls before. The customer who wants to skip the line, refuses to speak to us, and wants THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY!

I told the customer I would be able to help (which I could. This was a minor issue) they didn't want my help. I asked if I could gather some info to brief my super about the issue. They wouldn't even give me a first name. 

So I call my super. Let's call him Dave. Dave is an old African american gentleman who mentored me while I was a trainee. This guy is cool af. I felt bad dropping this on him.

Me: hey dave. I hate to do this to you but this customer is refusing my help and won't give me any information at all. They want a super

Dave: well you gotta atleast figure out what the problem is.

Me: I know but they literally won't tell me

Dave: *sigh* transfer them over

Now I'm not supposed to do this. But after the transfer I just muted my mic instead of dropping off the conference call. I was curious was this serious issue was.

Customer: I BOUGHT GRANOLA LAST SUMMER AND YOU STOPPED MAKING IT! I CALLED IN AND ONE OF YOUR DIP SHIP WORKERS SENT ME A COUPON BUT YOU STILL DON'T MAKE THE GRANOLA! WHAT THE FUCK ID THIS COUPON GOOD FOR IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT!

Dave: ma'am I understand your frustration but that was a limited edition product for the holiday and we no longer make it. I can send you a coupon-

Customer: I DON'T *WANT* A COUPON! I WANT YOU TO MAKE IT AGAIN!

Dave: ma'am I understand your frustration and I would be happy to forward your comments to our marketing team

Customer: YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT TO SHUT ME UP! YOU AIN'T GONNA DO SHIT

Thankfully where I work we have a ""zero tolerance verbal abuse"" policy. We just need to close the call.

Dave: We do not tolerate that type of language. Thank you for calling company and have a nice day.",66,0,0
Sorry your mom is dying but...,"This just happened and I can’t get over it. 

This lady calls in to cancel her moms subscription to the MLM I work for. Because she’s dying. Like in hospice. Her daughter tells me that her mom has days to live. Right off the bat, my heart sinks to the floor because we are so close to the deadline for cancelations and it requires a signature. Like with a pen and paper. And the company NEVER budges on that. 

So I go looking for a supervisor to beg for an exception and the most I can get is “find the family member who has power of attorney”. So, I get working on that, you know, interviewing the various family members of the woman dying in the next room (as one does). They figure out that the brother has power of attorney after a bit. 

I get to the brother and tell him how to cancel the account. He has to attach the power of attorney along with one other form he needs after going through all the bs with breaking into his moms stupid MLM account. Honestly, it’s such a lost cause. There’s so many forms and the deadline is in a few hours before we charge all this money to her account tomorrow. I feel terrible but I am literally powerless to help this family. 

At the end, I’m talking to the daughter from the beginning and honestly I don’t know what to say anymore. I wasn’t freaking trained for this and I feel like quitting immediately and then crying for a long time. But regardless, I don’t know how to end this call, so I say something awkward like “I hope you guys are okay...” and the lady starts bawling. Like crying her eyes out sobbing, can’t talk sobbing, just, heart breaking stuff coming through my headset. I’m pretty sure the jerk not-budging MLM call center employee just kinda needs to leave the situation immediately so I awkwardly work my way to a hanging up situation, put myself on not ready and stare at the ceiling for a while. 

Yeah, this freaking sucks.",869,0,0
Sometimes I want to strangle my coworkers.,"This week's been rough. My head is killing me and right now I hate everything, so apologies if this sounds overly edgy. This is going to sound rather pathetic to those of you who work at standard call centers and probably have even worse volume, but...yeah.

The new norm since Covid started is basically quiet one week, and then ""fucking insane hope you didn't plan to do anything else with your day except take calls and contemplate stabbing your own eyes out as your work piles up in front of you creating a week long backlog"" the next.

We're tech support. 20 people. Rotating phone hours. You know what doesn't help? 

People not getting on during their scheduled hours. 

You know what that means when we're ridiculously busy?

It means whoever IS online gets every single fucking call, every single needy-ass customer with a billion questions that comes through. Watching issue after issue, task after task pile up that I won't be able to get to in a timely manner because I'LL STILL BE TAKING CALLS. Sorry, Shirley, I know you needed me to send you instructions on how to edit your profile, but it looks like I won't be able to do that for the next FORTY FIVE MINUTES.

I should not be getting 15+ calls by myself in an hour and a half of being online. At least based on our team structure/the amount of people we typically have online during certain hours.

Sometimes I'll pull a Gondor calls for aid in our Slack channel if I see stuff piling up, but I can't be doing that every hour, I'm not their babysitter. It's gotten so much worse since we've been working from home and people can just go jerk off in their closets whenever they want to and say they're having ""internet issues"".

Today, after a full hour of nonstop back to back calls because there was only ever one other person active in the queue at any given time....I signed off thirty minutes early. I've *really* been trying not to be that person. I couldn't do it today.

My headache was reaching its peak, I had a lot of shit I had to do for people who had called, and there was no way I was going to be able to do so before the weekend if I stayed online waiting for more of these degenerate needy pieces of shit to call. Friday is ""everyone slam the queue before they close to get last minute shit done"" and everyone knows it, so nobody gets on.

I get it. I do. Really do. But if all of us are sick of the high volume and refusing to sign on out of protest, then guess what, we fuck over the one or two people who are actually on when they're scheduled. And then THEY'LL sign off out of protest because you can't troubleshoot 10+ calls in a row and not need to go dunk your head in cold water for a bit. 

I'll have to bring it up to my managers next week. Or something. I don't know, I'm probably making a bigger deal out of it than I should. One of the absolute worst feelings for me is feeling like I haven't been able to get anything done in a particular day, and that feeling goes into overdrive when I have been forced to literally do nothing but watch my queue populate with call after call after call.

So the cable guy is going to be late?," So this happened a long time ago well before I was a seasoned IT administrator all the way back in the year 1997. I know it was the summer of 1997 since I was working the phones during the week of famous Tyson vs. Holyfield fight; which would later be known as the Bit Fight.

I had a summer job working for a company that was a support phone bank for COX cable. The pay was ok, if I remember correctly it was like $9 an hour which at the time was pretty good for a freshmen in high school.

The building I worked at was about an hour east of Cleveland on the second floor of a bland building in the warehouse district of a city next to the town I lived in. It was pretty dingy; just rows of cubicles with supervisors at the end of each row to keep the phone plebs in line.

The job consisted of taking phone calls from COX cable customers. All the phone calls were from Michigan; specifically many were from Detroit.

The support requests ranged from new cable service, cancel service, add features and channels, remove features and channels, or add Pay Per View events.

So being that most of my clientele was from Detroit can you guess what the call was about 90% of the time? ... If you guessed it was assisting the customer understand that there cable TV stopped working because they had an overdue balance you are dead right.

Needless to say it was not a fun job, lots of I-Rate customers from inner-city Detroit that just wanted there cable TV back on and they did not want to pay the $197 overdue balance.

Anyways there was an incident that happened to one of my co-workers one day. And it went something like this:

\------------------------------------------------------------------

Cox Cable Support: This is Brian with COX cable customer support how can I help you?

Customer: I'm not actually a COX cable customer; I am calling on behalf of my neighbor who is a customer.

Brian: Ok, did you want to sign up for COX cable service?

Customer: No, I am actually calling just to let you know that there has been an incident. I overheard an argument with one of your cable tech's and my neighbor in the next apartment. Apparently his cable is being disconnected at the pole for non-payment or something like that. After some argument your cable tech was working on the pole in front of the apartment and my neighbor came outside with a revolver and shot the cable tech in the leg. I just wanted to call you guys and let you know that your cable tech is going to be late for this next appointment.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

I was told we then advised the concerned citizen to call 911.

P.S. Here is something interesting I just remembered.

A customer in upstate Michigan a few hours outside of Detroit could be weeks late on their cable bill and not be disconnected; a person in Detroit however, if they are late more then three days their cable would get shut off.

You see it all came down to economics; fact of the matter was COX was much more likely to still get paid from someone outside the city. The only way they were likely to see any money from people in the city was for them to call in and be forced to pay because there cable was disconnected.",18,0,0
They Think They Know Best,"So got this call yesterday about an extra charge on a customer's bill. Now we are all going through this pandemic, it has been, and is continuing to be stressful. It is frustrating that these companies think they know what's best for their customers when really that is far from the truth. A carrier network that I work for is doing a Covid Connect, which is supposed to help customers who can't pay their bill. It isn't really much help though because you only get 1 month deferred and you have to make those payments each month for that 1 month that has been deffered. Now I can understand if a customer asked for it, but in this case the customer never asked to have it, but yet was getting charged to make up that 1 month referral. Honestly the phone call was upsetting because I couldn't help her. She cant be refunded, her bill is higher, and she does not have a job right now. She is upset because she is living frugal with savings at the moment and the bill is out of her budget now. From talking with other coworkers there seems to be a ton of customers calling in on this issue because this network carrier has a system set in place that determines what accounts they think are going to be at risk and goes ahead applying the Covid Connect to their account. Customers have every right to be angry because they didn't ask for it, they didn't verbally consent for it. This shit is just beyond frustrating and this company needs to mind their own business. If a customer needs help they will call and ask for it. Otherwise don't give customers an extra charge they don't need.  I really want to cuss these higher ups out.",13,0,0
You want a refund for a complimentary paper?,"I am a customer service rep for a well known paper involving the stock market and other news. I had a call from a guy today that want to resume his weekend paper that he was receiving. I looked into his account and saw he only had digital access to his paper and the weekend paper was free for a year and had ended in May.

Me: I do apologize, sir. The weekend paper was complimentary and only valid for one year. I would be happy to start a weekend subscription that would only be an extra $2 a month on your already existing digital.

C: Can you know just extend it further for another free year? I did not even receive the paper every weekend and want to be compensated for that.

Me: I will not be able to do that, sir. This was free only for the year. We also would onoy be able to credit missed issues only a month back and thus subscription ended 2 months ago.

C: Uh, can I speak with your supervisor so they can give it to me then?

Me: My supervisor is not available at this time, sir. She would not be able to continue this subscription either since it is both expired and unpaid for...

C: Well I want this to be resolved and it appears you cannot do that, so what else can we do?

Karen: I will tweet about this and write to your CEO!,"This happened last week. Enjoy. Dates are in UK format: DD/MM/YYYY.

&gt; **Me:** Hello and welcome to Credit Card Fraud. How can I help?

&gt; **Karen:** I have just seen fraud on my statements and I'd like to raise a claim. 

[Security blah is done.]

&gt; **Me:** So can you go through the transactions that are fraudulent ma'am?

&gt; **Karen:** Yes, they're all the card payments to Bingo from 03/04/2019 through to 10/05/2020.

&gt; **Me:** [***internally***: [*what.the.fuck?!*]]

As these payments were quite far back, they could not be refunded as fraud. Government rules and bank regulations say that customers have ~12 months to raise any fraud claims.

&gt; **Me:** Thank you Karen. Unfortunately, as these are outside of the timescales to raise fraud I will be unable to raise the transaction as fraud and process a refund per the terms and conditions of your account.

&gt; **Karen:** WHAT?! This is ridiculous. I don't remember reading anything of the sort!

Yes Karen, because you did not read them. So I did what anybody would do in a similar sort of situation: brought up our T&amp;C's and read out the specific section relating to fraudulent transactions and the timescale within which customers must raise them with us. 

Also, when I was going through the transactions the payments were made as a subscription basis; i.e. just like Netflix payments. Or in easier terms, she was lying through her teeth, the payments were not fraud. 

&gt; **Karen:** Well, I never said that I wanted to get the payments refunded!! You **need** to raise these! And I used to work for the Bank. I don't remember these processes!

&gt; **Me:** (o.O) So you just want to raise fraud but don't want them refunded? And you're okay with having paid off these payments? Unfortunately, the T&amp;C's stand. We are unable to raise these as fraud. 

&gt; **Karen:** I want to speak to your manager! RIGHT NOW! I'm going to complain about this! If not I will even tweet about this!

&gt; **Me:** As we are all working from home ma'am I am unable to put you through to a manager at this very instance. Also, they cannot and will not go against the bank's procedures. I am sorry you want to raise a complaint. I will write a report for you and the complaint's dept. will get in touch with you within 3 working days.

&gt; **Karen:** Well they better! And I'm going to write to your CEO!

&gt; **Me:** And don't forget to tweet about your experience with the call.

&gt; **Karen:** Hmph!

"""I don't want a Greek engineer"". Reposting as didn't have enough karma first time around","

I used to work tech support for a broadband provider in the UK. Still work for the same company, but thankfully not in the call centre anymore! As tech support I dealt with anything from broadband, land-line, pc/laptop wireless issues etc...

A woman calls and says her broadband isn't working. I run through some tests and find there is a fault on the line and it needs and engineer. I run through the usual spiel about getting someone out, all the mandatory statements about cost if it's her fault etc and get her a date. The conversation that follows is what always sticks in my mind

Me: that's your engineer booked, I'll give you a call after the appointment to make sure everything is working

Customer: thank you. Can you make sure he's not Greek?

Me: sorry I didn't catch that? (thinking I must have misheard her)

Customer: I don't want a Greek engineer. The Greeks have installed listening devices in my garden. I see them every time I look out the window. Your engineer needs to sweep them away when he arrives

Me: erm...

Customer: and while he's at it, get him over to the hospital. I see the mast on top of it. The police have installed it to listen to my phone calls. I'm sick of being spied on by the police and the greeks

Me: I'm sorry the engineer is only able to fix your broadband. As its a broadband fault there may be something wrong with your phone as well so he should fix that as well...

Customer: OK thank you, as long as he's not Greek we'll be OK

It was a very weird conversation to say the least. The call ended and I put my notes on and booked my call back, not putting anything in the notes about the weird conversation.

I went back a few days later to call and see if everything was working following the engineer visit. The visit had been cancelled and there were more notes. The son had called the next day to cancel all services as he'd had to have his mother sectioned. Always thought it was a sad end of affairs",484,0,0

How may I help you?,"
So this is actually a story about my friend (I told him I would post this on reddit he agreed) he works as a call center agent in one of the largest BPO company in my country, this happened earlier this year. 

He finished his 6 months probation period and become a regular employee. We celebrated this and we drank alcoholic beverages his treat I didn't drink so much because I'm driving. Him on the other hand is too intoxicated to stand up by himself.

This is where the fun part happened. We are about to go home and I wake him up shaking him and calling his name ""friend wake up were going home"" his answer to that is ""Welcome to **** Customer Service how may I help you?"" I laughed so hard because his first instinct in his drunken state is his call center agent mode kicking in.

Then on our way to my car he passed out, but he woke up on our way to his place. He's talking again ""You have been such a great customer, and for that we want to share a special offer...."" can't remember the rest but it definitely came from his script. 
After that I told him about this at first he didn't believe me and told me I was making up stories not until I showed him the voice record. On his defense in his six months probation they were not allowed to speak our mother tongue even in lunch breaks. And they were only allowed to speak in english.",42,0,0
Today I realised just how little call centres care,"So my call centre is part of a larger company, which is centred around positive experiences and atmospheres. Today I learned just how much crap that is, at least for our side of the company.

I started this job almost 3 years ago now. About six months into the job, I was hospitalised for what was initially believed to be something really serious. It turned out to be something less serious, although still bad and related to stress. I was told to take it easier, and that if it were to happen again that could be a serious concern.

Work kept me on easy duties for a couple of months, and at the time I really thought they cared.

Now... it should be noted that new management has come in in the last 6 months.

Basically, I've started feeling the same way I did then. Tearful, stressed a lot, shaky and out of control, gradually getting worse. Back then it built and built. I explained this to one of my supervisors, who then reported my concerns to a manager.

My manager said this morning that we all need to be pulling our weight and he doesn't think I'm strongest in a position off the phones.

Have you just blown up your house?,"Back around 2003 I worked for a has and electricity company in the UK. I was on the prepayment team which always had good stories as people who were on this type of meter were people who had serious debt or were generally scummy. It was rare to get the nice people who just wanted to keep track of their bills. One story always amuses me any time I think about it. A guy called in cos he had no hot water and knew there was money there so he figured his meter was broken. These meters tend to be under stairs in a darkened cupboard. Conversation as follows

Me: is there a display on the meter

Customer: I can't see, it's pretty dark. There's normally a light on the meter but that's not on

Me: OK, I just need to make sure there's no display, can you press the red button please?

Customer : I can't see a red button, it's right in the corner. Hang on, let me light a match so I can see better

Now having an open flame near a gas device is never a good idea. Before I had a chance to tell him so, the phone went dead. I started panicking thinking that this guy has just killed himself and blown up his house. I asked my manager what I should do and he said try calling him back and if there's no answer call the police.

I called back and the guy answers

Me: is everything OK?

Customer : yeah, match burned my finger and I dropped the phone, it must have hung up

Me: phew! Don't light a match near the meter, I thought you'd blown yourself up!

Customer: oh yeah, didn't think of that...  Anyway, I did manage to notice there's no display

Boring end was it turned out the meter was faulty and I had engineer replace it. Still, panicked the life out of me for a moment!",805,0,0
Advice for coping with depression/anxiety from call center work?,"I have been doing call center work for an Internet/Phone/Cable provider for 4 years now. It is my first real job, I got it straight out of high school. 

For the first year, I had a decent time. There were still a lot of people from my training class that I had become acquainted with, I was excited to have actual paychecks &amp; was hopeful for the future.

I think I started truly hating my job a year ago. Over time I have become more aware of how customers act when they're on the phone with me. I no longer have empathy for anyone if they act condescending or sarcastic to me. I no longer ""understand"" why you would treat someone like shit who is just doing their job. For some reason, the longer I have been at this job the worse I have been able to handle it emotionally. I requested 2 weeks of personal leave off due to stress &amp; mental health but it was denied so I asked my manager and they gave me 4 days off instead.

Even though I am working from home for now, I still feel crippling anxiety and depression from this job. I hate waking up in the morning because I know I will have to talk to assholes for 8 hours that blame me for things I have no control over. I hate the anxiety of feeling like I cannot step back for a moment if I am stressed, because management will begin asking questions. I hate the anxiety of spinning the roulette wheel every time I end the call and possibly end up with an even angrier person. I hate the things that I have to say, I hate the things I have to try to make sense of because they make no sense, I hate the headaches, I hate that this job made my voice raspy, I hate almost everything.

BLM BLM BLM,"This happened a couple of hours ago and I am still perplexed.

I am currently in a leadership position that basically helps our agents with issues for policies, keying, and take escalations, including sup calls.

I got a message from a pal of mine and she said, oooh I know you will love this one.  Oh boy, I think.  She goes on to tell me that the customer is insisting that we have her SSN incorrect (its mostly blacked out) and thats why the system says she has to do one of our two deposit options to get service.  Customer also claims they were told by the original agent they would not have to do any deposit options, the equipment will be mailed out right away.  Not so.

You have deposit, you get two options.  You will not get any service with us or equipment sent until one of two is collected.  National policy.  (We have had a string of new hires lately and I bet they were the original agent).

Coworker also tells me she thinks it is fraud cause the address that popped on screen was disconnected and it is RIGHT next door to this woman trying to not pay her deposit.  Probably, yea.  But ok, we will update the SSN and run it again.  So we do.  Same results.  And now it says her SSN is invalid so now she has to come in person to a store, which are all closed, to verify her info.

Customer still irate with my coworker and coworker tells me she wants a sup.  Ok, here we go.

Customer comes on line, I ask her to tell me what is going on while I have her on mute because I know this story (we have heard it a thousand times).  Basically repeats she's expecting the equipment but its not here because no one told her about the deposit (5 different people did) and she is tried of waiting around.  She goes on for 5 minutes.  When she is done, I unmute and apologize the original agent was incorrect, this is a national policy, and nothing will be released until she does deposit and ID check.

I am continuing to tell her that we even updated the SSN for her to make sure she didn't have a deposit when she interrupts me.  I tell her ma'am, I listened quietly to what you had to say, I need you to listen to me while I talk, so we are both being respectful.  Her reply, shouting to the man in the background cussing up a storm, oh she just told me to shut up - who's your supervisor.

Ma'am I did not say anything like that.  I asked to be able to speak without being interrupted just like I gave you that same respect.

So then there is some back and forth about nothing is happening unless you pay.  All the time she is half paying attention to me and the screaming man in the background, so of course I have to repeat myself.

Suddenly the man is in my ear and he is babbling something about BLM to you white folks only when it looks good to you (yea, im white) but when it really comes to it BLM aint shit.  BLM aint shit to you whites.  I want my MF'ing services.  Show me BLM matters to you!

I'm silent because, did I just hear what I think I heard?  He is using the BLM movement to justify getting services without paying???  Uh....

Sir, yes BLM is important and I totally support BLM.  But that doesn't mean we can give you our services for free.  According to company, all lives still have to pay their bills.

Why I quit my call center job.,"I got a call center job with an international package delivery company based in the US that I will call Brown Parcel Service (BPS) in May of this year. It was the height of Covid 19 restrictions and a lot of people were ordering packages because they couldn't leave their homes. Highest package volumes were in California and New York, because those places were hit hard by the pandemic and were on strict lockdowns.
 
Naturally, I got a lot of calls from those areas because there were a lot of weird things happening, such as packages getting delayed, not getting picked up, showing as out for delivery for days at a time and packages not showing up when a customer paid for them to show up (overnight delivery, two day shipping, etc.)
 
The call that made me decide to quit was regarding the last issue.
 
The man was from an area with a high volume of packages. He had paid a high price for overnight shipping, and from what we could see, the package did get to his city the next day, but it had been five days since then, and every day the package read as ""out for delivery"" but hadn't shown up. He wanted to know when his package would come and frankly, I didn't know what to tell him. The most recent update on my side was ""out for delivery"" but I know he didn't believe that, and frankly neither did I. He was also asking about a refund because it didn't show up on time. So I put him on hold and called the help line to ask what I should say and to ask about the refund.
 
The woman who answered told me the same thing I had already told the guy, the delay was caused by a high package volume and a lack of staff due to the Covid 19 pandemic. I asked if I should transfer him to billing to see about a refund, to which she said the following:
 
""Because BPS can not currently guarantee delivery times, we are not doing refunds for late packages.""
 
So I went back to the guy and told him again why his package was delayed, and I told him that his package was getting priority because it was late, but there were just so many packages. He said he understood, but then he asked again about a refund. I begrudgingly told him what I was told about a refund, and he gave me a scoffing laugh before hanging up.
 
I couldn't disagree with that judgement, if I'm being honest. The way I see it is that BPS is not only screwing over their customers by charging ludicrously high prices for services they can't promise to deliver on, and won't refund, they're screwing over their **highest paying customers** by selling them a lie. The worst part is that most of the customers don't get a say in being customers, they're customers of online stores that choose to use BPS. Since quitting I've ordered a few packages that were delivered by BPS and I didn't get to pick a different shipping method.
 
I quit the day after I had to tell that guy that he wasn't getting a refund. I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't lie to customers that their package was coming when it wasn't, and I didn't want to tell another customer that they got scammed.
 
Edit: just wanted to add, I went through a week of training, a week of nesting, and only lasted three days taking calls on my own before I quit.",20,0,0
No longer required.,"Used to work answering phones for a disabled equipment office, that lends out walking frames, raised toilet seats, bath lifts, and other equipment to clients to have more mobility and independence at home. 

In the UK the service is provided **free** between local council social work/occupational therapy, and the National Health Service district nurses.

""No longer required"" is the usual euphemism for a **client having** **passed away**. 

All the loans were recorded on a computer (on floppy disk), but that didn't mean they were always easy to find, or the address was right, etc.

Nurse phones up: 

*I'm ever so sorry snivel, sob, but can you come and collect, sob, snivel, Mr Thingy's stuff? Snivel. It's no longer required. Sob. Mr Thingy's gone to Rose Cottage. Snivel. Sob.* 

I pull up the record on the computer and make a note to contact the next of kin to arrange a suitable time for uplift. 

About 10 minutes later (in fact it might even have been the next call):

*Hello. This is Mrs Thingy. My husband's died. Can you come and collect his equipment. Next Tuesday? Super. Thanks awfully. Bye.* 

Fortunately I still had the record to hand so was able to be totes professional, not ask the client to spell the address, etc. 

One might have expected the nurse to be a little calmer and the wife a little more distraught, but death takes people in different ways and perhaps the wife found sorting things out to be therapeutic.",12,0,0
The most unnerving call I've ever taken,"I work in retail customer service for a company that allows split payments on some items. One day I take a call from a man, he gives me the account details of a woman we'll call Jane. He confirms Janes security details all fine and states hes calling about an overdue payment. Due to data protection laws in my country, even with security confirmed we have to confirm with the named person on account before we can take the payment.

I tell this guy about the data protection laws and he claims to be Jane's boyfriend. I apologise and explain again and ask if she's there just to confirm we can talk to him. Firm no. 

Me: ok so we've got the telephone number xxxxxx on account, would we be able to contact Jane on this number on a specific date and time? We're open 24h.

Him: No that's my number. She doesn't have a phone and won't be available. She can email you. 

Me: sorry but we would need to confirm it's her first so this would have to be done via phone with Jane. Is there maybe a medical reason she cannot come to the phone?

Him: no she just can't come to the phone. Ever.

Me: unfortunately I can't do anything further today but i will pass the details to the finance team so they can contact Jane. Is the address on the account correct?

Him: yes but she's not here

Me: ok well do you have contact details for her so we can clear this up? Or if you have power of attorney we can speak to you but we'd need the documents posting to us?

Him: no she lives here. There's no power of attorney needed. I dont know her well. The details are all correct. She just won't be coming to the phone again *hangs up*

So i had a quick look at the previous notes on the account as i had a feeling the man I had spoken to may have been Jane but I found that Jane had personally called us a few months prior about a different overdue payment and our finance team had done all the necessary security checks to allow her split payments.

I passed the details to our fraud team but i always wonder what happened to Jane and if she's ok.",17,0,0
"why treating your support agent badly can backfire, a lot!","somewhat long, but i got encouraged by u/Cylys to write it.

so, the Cast.

me, tech support agent for several companies in a third party support center.

one of my female co-workers.

Mr H., a british ""customer""

Our contact person at one of the projects, that was in the callcenter visiting.

this takes place in 2002(I quit to move countries in 2004, just for background)

The story starts with with a call on a line for a now defunct producer of gaming accessories.

The call starts badly, someone is cursing and I just barely get out a name, luckily the number on my display matches up on our phonebook search app.

It seems his joystick short cirquited and burnt his pc down, which is completely impossible and rather a stupid argument, but okay.

After being treatened with ombudsman, lawyers and some kind of tv-show about bad consumer goods, he shouts some more how we'll regret not giving in to his demand of new gear, he hangs up, I close the call with a warning that he might be a scammer and that's it.... or so I thought.....

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks later, one of the project supervisors takes me off the phone to ask if I remember the call?

Sure, he was just about memorable enough to remember the general gist of the call.

Turns out, mr H. had been trying his trick on a lot of companies and some where other customers of ours.

This wouldn't have triggered much of an alarm, except he had called my female coworker a ""dumb cow"" and she carries a grudge....

after she had got her on one line, He had called one of our customers ""insanely large producer of mice and keyboards"", while most of our customers where rather hands off and not to bothered about what happened after calls end, this one is a bit different.

So, customer is now on the shit-list of a company  that has more lawyers than some small countries and joy of joys, our contact person is actually coming to the callcenter in a week.

A week of nothing much happening goes by and our contact is standing next to me, the supervisor and the other agents, and joy of joys, I get to be the one calling the customer back....

&amp;#x200B;

Call starts normal and I do my spiel.

company x has checked your request for an non-warranty product and we'll not give you any free stuff.

At this point the usual threats of lawyer, ombudsman and ""I know consumer tv show hosts"" etc. start.

I get tapped on my shoulder by the contact, he says it's his turn now.....

""please hold for a representative from our main office""

&amp;#x200B;

I mute my mic and he unmutes his....In about 2 minutes of uninterrupted monotone speech, he explains the customer that any other threats, calls to our line or third parties about this will be met with the full legal power of the company and he would advise against lying to our support staff or abusing anyone again or there will be consequences. There was a few seconds of stunned silence and a \*click\* and we never heard from mr. H ever again!",522,0,0
Life Insurance Customer Service Hell. Rant,"I've been at this company six months. This was due to losing my job. I work as part of a large pension/life insurance company. Not directly as I'm employed through a company that manages a specific part of the company.

I'm at my absolute wit's end. To think I believed their promises. The systems are an absolute joke. Archaic. The processes are incredibly labourous. It takes multiple steps to do something that should be simple. Our knowledge system?Yeah no search bar. The names often don't match the exact content. You are expected to memorize where every single PowerPoint is tucked away or you get pulled up for it.

Management don't give a damn about you whilst simultaneously (when top brass appears) pretending to care. The senior management are made up of two-faced back stabbers and borderline sociopaths.

We get tons of wrong calls for other departments. Most of which are impossible to transfer to because they are always busy. So when the lines are closed, we are the ones to be the bearer of bad news.

We are watched like prisoners. Quality assurance emails constantly. Financial integrity email you about the fact you didn't put the customers name in the format they like, even though that is the format on the bank card. I have to sit daily and listen to people tell me they got screwed over by a financial advisor and have to tell them they can't get their money back. Financial advisors (who are mostly clueless about the products which is really concerning) speak to you like garbage and complain about you wasting their time. If you are on a late shift, they expect you to wait until the lines are completely clear before logging out. I've been stuck on for 15 minutes past finish. If lines close, the lines close imo.

Worst of all, due to lockdown, sackings are coming. I'm likely going to be out of a job in the next month. Part of me is glad and part of me is terrified as a parent.

You sound fine to me,"I’ll set the scene: it was 2018 and I was working as a telemarketer for a major Australian telecommunications company. This story is about the lovely kinds of management you find in call centres.

They had a really high turnover rate and poor retention. When you needed a sick day, you needed to make “voice contact” with your team leader an hour (not more, not less) before your shift starts and they would “assess” if your sick day was legitimate. Every sick day was assumed to be work avoidance and it was guilty proven innocent. Then, you had to get a medical certificate as well. (That part is fair, though).

The call centre I worked in was really disgusting and unhygienic. There was someone always really sick with something they’ve caught at work. Even during my training there, 6 out of 15 people came down with the exact same infection (cold or flu or something) all at the same time two weeks into training.

I had just gotten over this infection and it was in my first week onto the floor. It was 4 days into being out of training, that it started. I started to lose my voice (along with all the classic infection symptoms), which I noticed straight away as I was talking all day every day. Because there was no rest or let up, I eventually couldn’t speak in full sentences, as every second or third word just couldn’t leave my mouth. I had three customers complain on my calls saying that the line was bad because my “voice kept cutting in and out”.

I went to the team leader after the third call and said I really had to go home as not only did I feel like I was getting sick, I had no voice. I needed to take a breath after each word. She said that losing your voice is not a valid reason to leave work, but would let me leave since I had cold symptoms. There were 3.5 hours left in my shift.

She said me in a funny way as I left, “I’ll see you TOMORROW, thebiggestyikesever, but you need a medical certificate for the time lost today!”

When I was home that night waiting for an after hours doctor to get the med cert, I kept “testing” my voice to see if it was getting better or worse by saying random words. I believed I had laringitis. The after hours doctor agreed and put that on the med cert and said that I really need at least 2 days off, but I said no no, at least put tomorrow’s date on it but not 2 days. I knew there was no way I’d get that much time off knowing how she acted towards me.

In the morning, I could say probably one word in a sentence so it was worse and there was no volume at all. I call the team leader and after telling me “pardon?” and “what did I say?“ many times, she said “yeah no, you sound fine to me.”

Apparently, when you’re a call centre worker and you have laringitis, that’s not a legitimate reason to have sick leave.",340,0,0

“I’ll take you and your company to the cleaners!”,"Hi all! First time posting so be kind 😂

So a bit of backstory: I work for one of the UK’s large internet, home phone and TV providers. I deal with tech support, sales, general customer relations and so on. 

Now my company only suppling home phone services opposed to business phone lines is important to the story as you’ll soon find out

So a customer who I shall call MK I.E Male Karen calls in to express his rage that we’ve “been overcharging his phone bill for months. I used to pay £10 per month but now I’m paying £70.” 

Checking his account he’d downgraded from paying a set £10 to make unlimited amount of calls to a pay per minute plan and due to making 90 ish calls to the same number per month he had been charged for the usage per minute, which racks up huge costs. 

Of course MK is furious. States he doesn’t use his house phone to make calls so shouldn’t be incurring charges. He only has his house phone to divert calls to his business as his house number was being used as a business line, we should have told him this would happen (a typical line from customers in my industry.) MK wants a refund for the £210 in charges he’s incurred due to his own error. 

***For those who don’t know much about phone calls etc. - when you divert a call from line A to B it is actually line A (MK’s home phone) calling line B (MK’s business phone) in order to transfer the line to them and therefore counts as making a call, therefor still charged per minute.***

I inform MK that diverting the call is the same as his home phone calling his business and this is why there’s charges. I also inform him we provide domestic and not business lines and that using the line for business is a breach of his contract with us, so I can’t refund him for the charges. 

Long pause on his end and then I practically hear the foam coming from his mouth as he starts screaming at me that “as a customer of 6 years I’ll take you and your company to the cleaners if you even think of cancelling my contract and if I don’t get my charges back I will sue for loss of earnings and the stress you will cause me, the loss of my f-ing customers and blah blah blah”

Being an experienced agent I’ll usually warn customers 3 times about abuse and then will disconnect the call. However, through the whole experience something isn’t sitting right with me about the info he’s giving and how his bill is so damn high from diverted calls all to the same business number...

...So I ask about the volume of calls that are coming through and what business he’s running. By this time he’s so furious and acting like an invincible big man and so sure he has grounds to sue if we disconnect for breach of contract terms that he reveals he’s running a call centre with 36 agents using our phone line service. 

Basically his customers would call his house phone number he was paying us for, it would divert to his call centre, where his customer service agents would then answer the diverted calls and arrange boiler repairs and installation etc. 

This of course is a huge breach of contract and a massive cost to the company I work for. 

Usually at the point a customer telling us “I use my house number to run a business” it’s not huge. It’s more along the lines of a designer, DJ, hairdresser, freelance IT,  who gives clients their home number because they don’t have an office etc. This guy however, takes first prize for his audacity of running a call centre from our services. So I tell MK that I’ll speak to another department and call him back. You know, “yes mr customer, I’ll see what I can do mr loyal customer”.

So I speak to our compliance and fraud teams to investigate the breach of contract.

The fallout: 
They issue MK with a 31 cancellation letter, informing him that:
1. He has 31 days to find a new provider before we cut him off for breach of contract 
2. Because his line rental was still within a minimum term contract, he has to pay early termination charges. (18.99 per month for the 15 months left of his contract =£284.85 additional charges to him)
3. He will not be receiving the disputed charges because he’s broken his contractual agreement with us. 

Funny thing is if he was nicer I’d have let it slide. I’ve never emailed compliance on a customer except this guy.

My experience with a Call Centre company,"I’ve been a redditor for 8 years, and figured I’d give my opinion of working there on the appropriate subreddit, of course!

I worked for a place called....well...We’ll call them Datachoice. Think of two good words that come together that are smilies to the words data and choice.

[This is my first post about the story on the CC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/callcentres/comments/hyn1q0/didnt_receive_my_work_schedule_online_after_first/)

[This is my second post about the story on the CC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/callcentres/comments/hznx2q/update_on_schedule_issue/)

This is more of a response to what I posted in this sub, or, my *tale*. 

Let’s just start from the beginning: 

I started working for datachoice last Wednesday for training. It was basic training: watching clock-and-go  videos that lightly and animatedly addressed their issues. I really didn’t even see a script that day. 

The next day, my dog ran away. I had to go find her, and one thing I appreciated was the fact that datachoice let me go for the day.

However, that meant rescheduling my training.

Here is my email regarding my SECOND training experience to HR:

My name is Puffpuffpolo, and today was what I am going to forever call my first ""Inaugural"" day working at home for datachoice. I am working from the ************ ""server"" location (you could call it)?

I started training OFFICIALLY last Wednesday. I had an African American lady as a trainer, and for the amount of time that we met I did the basic tasks that are assigned that day: paperwork and some online course training. This was a basic first day, nothing to complain about that has not been said to you a thousand times already. 

The next day, unfortunately, I had a family emergency (*yes, sigh, I consider my family my dog*)and could not attend training, which forced me to take my training the next week. This is where the trouble began: I met my trainer. Upon arriving into the Google Meet conference there were no issues at all: in fact she was very kind and professional with how she first handled the training seminar. While in the group, I had the pleasure of making my acquaintance with another trainee, D. D has worked for Datachoice AND other call center companies before: and knew exactly what was going on for the entirety of the training seminar. 

However, even she can verify the true ethical culprit of this complaint is my trainer. 

At first, I was going to send this message and inform you that the way she was training us was the ""Laissez Faire"" approach by only telling us what online courses to take; helping us with one of the courses to ensure that we passed. 

As odd as it sounds, It seemed as if understanding our job at Datachoice was what she did not intend to teach us while in fact training us to work at Datachoice. We did watch the required videos, listened to the required short irrotic call clips together and witnessed the required template being used (aka only read to us by someone else slide for slide). While in the Google Meet, we very (and i use this word broadly) seldom discussed the main point of our business: communicating with THE PEOPLE who call us. Each hour that passed these past few days I feared the underlying fate:

""What is going to happen when I speak to a real human being""

This is coming from someone who is accustomed to serving in an ultra-fast-paced restaurant, with additional working background following Forbes 5-star resort standards: I do not usually fear these things unless I know I am not well prepared. My evidence for this are the first calls I took when I entered the call system. You will hear me actively pass every single caller that was forwarded to me because I was frantic. Additional evidence of this is the phone call I took with Mrs.N, an employee on Slack that holds the title of ""Learning Engagement Supervisor"", who was responding to other employee's issues with their calls (I did learn in training that this was the way to figure out some problems, but was NOT given instruction on how to correctly insert my name OR, simply, use the app.) I also have messages with Mrs.N and Mr.A who both helped (N more so than A) me not only calm down and assess what was really going on at Datachoice, but practically trained me properly within 20 minutes, a task my trainer failed to do with (in her own words) EXTRA days to work with. 

The ethical dilemma that I wanted to address was what was told to me by an employee that so happened to be on the Google Meet the moment I was booted from the meeting (which I had asked her to stay on the line for, I wanted quality assurance my first time around, another issue that I originally wanted to address to you before even more drastic news came to me that did bring up cause of concern). Once she omitted me from the meeting, she made remarks to D about me that no higher-standing employee should ever tell another training employee.

 Apparently, the phrase ""I can't stand around and hold puff’s hand all day, he needs to learn on his own"" was uttered. I find this kind of behavior among my superiors to be uppauling, especially having to endure seeing this person AGAIN only moments later inside of a randomly-made Google Meet meeting (which people started to FINALLY get what working at Datachoice is truly about)

There is a lot more to the story, and I can just as easily provide proof that my training did not go well due to an exposed judgemental superior training Datachoice employee from comparing my first calls taken to my last wave of work starting at 1:10 as well as messages that are on my Slack. 

I hope we can at least discuss this matter professionally as soon as possible so that future employees may not have to endure the same process I went through: at least for my own sake going forward with Datachoice (which i do plan on doing)


Thank you,

Puffpuffpolo 

Hereeeeeee Weeeeeeee GO:

In regards to why I left: well, I didn’t want someone who I reported to HR listening to my calls and judging me for my bonus. If you can get along with your coworkers in this work environment you CAN achieve success. 

To take it a step further, I was making a couple of calls to Comcast about my cable bill and service (I’m moving in a few days). I used the line that I ordinarily used on their app...and received two different people, one of which transferred me to a ‘sales agent’. Their names were Mark and Hellen (sadly I do not remember the sales agents name). 

I just decided to tell them my story: what the hell happened to me. They were shocked, but told them I would give them props on the xfinity app. 

I feel as if some of the calls I made to cable company were that of people that are EXACTLY like me: ill-equipped ordinary people that have no true knowledge of the company: they’re just given a script, and you read it AS TO THE POINT AS POSSIBLE. 

If you do: Horray!

If not: expect to hear from it at some point.


Question: While working for a WAH CC,
have you ever felt like you’re being watched? Do ya know how they required you to have a webcam to work for them? Sometimes a company will actively make you sit there in front of it, and you will be punished if you move. 

Luckily for me and this job, I don’t think that occurred. 

But know that shiny new computer they gave you? I guarantee you if you put it in front of someone who knows computers, it’d be scary to find the hardware that’s inside that the employee may be unaware of.

Again, I used my computer, and their software: which was mainly just one window on your computer that you can even detach and allow you access to your computer while using their software. I’ll give it to tech: they did a GREAT job on getting the software in front of their employees as quick and as user-friendly accessible as possible. I could log on anytime 24/7 365. I just didn’t know if they had access to everything else on my computer, or if they simply just sent me access to their server and they could see everything on my window.

HR:

Oh boy. Here we go. Let me explain post 2. 

The initial call that I picked up I was asked to hold as the other 2 datchoice HR employees were added to the line by the companies Corporate HR Manager. I was joyful that I was on the call, but a little nervous and 100% going to loose and not get additional training. 

What I didn’t know is that they’re about to tell me I cannot receive additional training REGARDLESS of the fact that an investigation was being taken place.

To make matters worse, even if the trainer was suspended, she would still come back and have to do her job: which includes:

- Helping out all employees whom she trained (I could really only have access to her as my official trainer in the end, that could not change) 
- Helping out in the chat rooms answering questions (her and the other upper management were the ones who would help me....or *not* help me *as fast as possible*. If you were in upper management of a company, want to help an employee who is on the phones with a problem, who reported you (or your friend) to HR, possibly putting their job in jeopardy? IMO the answer is no, ESPECIALLY if that person is brand ‘spankin new. 
-Help rate people’s calls (Listening to employees calls ANOTHER PROBLEM I have with someone reported to HR), which determine bonuses for people (“Hey...that sounds like puffpuffpolo!” Just the fact that she recognizes my voice: due to the fact that she does WILL impact the score that I receive which IN THE END DETERMINES MY TOTAL PAY. She works at a call center, dealing with different voices every day: she knows what her trainees sound like.) 
-Be a superior (just...I think she’s a fantastic person, but IMO shouldn’t be a trainer for datchoice. But as a human I am well aware, nothing I can do about it)


Those were the opinions I have about what their department told me. In the end, I climbed to the top and was told there wasn’t much they could do. 

I feel as if they think I left because of the training situation. No, I left because they told me even if they tried, she’d be put back on staff...and that’s not fair. I know there are lots of managers who do the same thing she does, but I don’t want to risk that with my family: even if she has a good heart.

Laughed whilst my friend and colleague got screamed at by a Karen. Then she called again and the it came through to my phone.,"I had two close friends whilst I worked in the call centre and the three of us always found amusement in each other getting screamed at by Karens. To us, there was nothing funnier than watching one of us try their best to stay professional whilst getting abused. We would giggle uncontrollably and be happy that this time we were not 'the unlucky one!'

Well, this time it did a complete 180.

My friend had 'the worst customer we've ever had' on the phone. Stereotypical Karen, screaming at him for something completely out of his control. Watching my friend try to deal with it whilst giving us glances that could only be interpreted as him saying 'please end my life' was hilarious. The call finally ended after about an hour of abuse. My colleague told me the full story and said she apparently ended the call so she could 'calm down'(her words!).

A minute later my phone rang, and it was her. I don't know what she did to try to calm down, but it clearly didn't work, she was even angrier. For the next hour she tormented me non-stop whilst my two friends then had their fun laughing at my misfortune, exactly what I deserved!",811,0,0

Specialist: Hi, I have customer on the phone who has been very difficult.
Me: What is making him difficult?
S: He took so long to find a hose.
Me: Okay I have his case here you can bring him on.

The customer is brought on the line and I go through my normal script and confirm things with him. He wants the items shipped to his house then wants to know the cost of his order. With shipping it was more expensive and he asked if it could go to his local store for pick up as shipping wouldn’t be charged then. I confirm the address of the store as well as his total and then he asked for the stores phone number. I kindly and calmly explained to him the stores don’t take phone calls so they do not have a phone number. This is our interaction:

 Customer: So they don’t have a phone number, huh?
Me: No sir, they don’t. All calls are routed to the call center.
C: So this number that I call *gives call center number* isn’t the number to my store? But it calls you?
Me: Yes sir, that is correct.
C: Why didn’t you volunteer that information to me? You should know what the customer wants. I shouldn’t have to listen to you beat around the bush for 5 minutes over a phone number. How long have you even been in customer service?!
Me: Two years sir. I’m willing to volunteer information to you, you just need to ask and I’m happy to oblige.
C: You need to learn what your customers want instead of wasting their time. So anyway, let’s move on because time is money.
Me: I’ve been waiting for you to confirm your information. I’m ready when you are.

Mind you, he spent 15 minutes trying to figure out what he wanted done with his order. After the order is placed, I give him his confirmation and the date and time the order would be ready for pick up.  I get off the phone and I get on with my week.

Fast forward to today, I get an email from my manager saying that I have an opportunity regarding my phone call with this guy. Apparently he was pissed because I didn’t tell him the store hours and he showed up after the store was closed. Mind you, had he asked I would have happily told him. I was told I did a good job of handling him being rude, but I need to share the store hours from now on even if customers don’t ask. That was not part of our standard work. So I got in trouble for not being a mind reader.",100,0,0
The Night that the phones went out in Kentucky,"So I worked for a large telecom... I guess this was four or five years ago now... And one night, our phone system went down. Nobody in the entire Midwest was taking calls. Everyone was screwing around, phones had been down about an hour at this point. Suddenly, I hear it. *BEEP* Shit, everyon e, it's happening! Everyone is freaking out because we know we're gonna be slammed the rest of the night. I have a technician making a payment, and everyone is on the edge of their seat waiting for the next call to come in.

Another hour and a half goes by without a single call, because that technician got lucky, the phones aren't fixed. I got the only call in the entire Midwest for a two and a half hour period when the phones were down. All these years later, I'm still salty about getting that call.",40,0,0
"""I'm calling you as the stress of dealing with your company has killed me""","Lurker, occasionally comments but this is my first time posting.

To set the scene, I work for a large UK Energy company and have done for 12.5 years. We open Monday to Saturday for all customer service and on a Sunday for customers who have a loss of supply. However, we do get some strange calls from customers who chance their arm to see who's in and sound off at some one new.

This customer had moved in to a property around 4 years ago and as part of his tenancy agreement, he was responsible for the electricity and gas. He didn't feel he was supposed to and believed his landlord should be paying the bills

The complaint has reached deadlock where we tell the customer we can no longer help and to go to the regulator. The customer had done this already but he still wanted to call us on a Sunday

This person decided to call us and was speaking to one of my staff working at home, demanding a manager. Call back arranged as I was in the office, blah blah....

After looking in to the account, I looked forward to speaking to this customer and opened the call in the same way to confirm data security and to advise calls are recorded for training etc.

C: ""I wanted to say that I'm unhappy with how your company has dealt with me""

Me: ""Sorry about that, but I can see we have explored everything we can with you and your complaint is now deadlocked""

C: ""Is that how you deal with me? I am not supposed to pay this bill""

Me: ""I can see what we've asked of you before, but at this time, I have to refer you to the Ombudsman in relation to your complaint""

C: ""Can you please add this to the complaint. I'm calling you as the stress of dealing with your company has killed me""

Me: ""Killed you? But how am I speaking to you today?""

C: ""Your company has killed me and I want you to note it down""

Me: ""...... Just to make it clear to you, I would suggest that you give that opinion to the Ombudsman and they can add it to their case file. I won't be adding that to our records here""

C: ""What is your name?"" (Customer classic)

Me: ""It's Careful\_Garden""

C: ""Good, I will take them you didn't take me seriously that your company killed me""

Me: ""No problem. Please contact the Ombudsman tomorrow and they'll take that information from you""

C: ""So you won't speak to me any more today?""

Me: ""No, there is nothing I can do. I wish you good luck in speaking to the Ombudsman""

Never thought I'd get to speak to a corpse and despite being made redundant with my final day this Friday, customers continue to surprise me!

People that use customer service workers as punching bags are despicable.,"So I work at a techy type company where people do internet things. 

Customer comes in at 11/10 mad. She has had a lot of problems, apparently, and is claiming that I personally stopped her from accessing a function of her product by putting a generic error in front of her on the website. 

I then tried to do my “let’s align against this problem and get it solved” thing and put myself on the customer’s side. This was, apparently, a grave insult against her and her family line. For the next 5 minutes she talked very slowly, listing out every sin that she has had to suffer at the hands of the company I work for and blames me personally for all the technical issues she’s been experiencing with her websites. Her words said she hated me, but the way she said them made me feel like she thought I was the dumbest creature to be rejected from my mother’s cringe womb. 

I really felt the love. 

During this rant I refreshed the page and the error was gone. I tried to inform her but she only talked louder, working herself into a frothy lather of rage for several more minutes while the issue she was having sat in front of us both, completely fixed. 

As she was still going, the putrid stench of her hateful rant spilling from her lips and into my ear. I could practically hear her hooves stamping the hardened earth of the deepest pit of hell she had dug her way into. It was the least appealing soundtrack for my casual reddit scrolling I could think of. 

With the bile finally emptied from the core of her being, the conversational back and forth finally allowed me to speak. 

“Well it looks like that error cleared up. Go ahead and refresh the page an-“

“No! You do it! Do SOMTHING!”

“Alrighty!” And I did what she wanted with literally 2 clicks and let her know

“GOOD. BYE.” 

“Have a wonderful rest of your day!”

And as she’s hanging up the phone she said “F*cking reject” loud enough for me to hear. 

If I had one iota of respect for her I might have been hurt. 

Anyway, if you ever treat other human beings like this, you are not a good person. I hope she gets better someday, but probably not.",779,0,0
It finally happened,"Well, the one thing I have always waited for finally happened today. I've never been told to do this by my company, but I feel it is common sense. I work tech support for a local ISP.

Call comes in. Customer is angry, says internet is not working. I pull the account up, and can see from the activities there is already a history. She tells me that she has been told numerous times that the internet is not working in her back bedroom because her wifi signal does not reach that far, and she needs to purchase a range extender. I verify this with the activities on the account, however it looks like we also had a tech go to her house and check things, who determined the cheap wireless chip in her tv's is the problem, and verified everything else is working.

Based on this, and the info she gives me, I come to the same conclusion. She gets livid. She starts yelling, and threatening to cancel. I apologize, and tell her if she wishes to cancel, she can call on Monday when customer service is here. She tells me she is coming into the office, and not leaving until a manager speaks to her. Our offices are currently closed due to a Global pandemic, so good luck with that.

She asks for the supervisor, and I smile and let her know I am the night shift supervisor. She says she hardly believes that, and hangs up.

The real magic happens after the call. We get a chat request, and it is her threatening legal action.

I reiterated the 3 different options we gave her, all of which she refused, and then let her know that due to legal action being threatened, she will have to go through upper management with any further contact. She keeps messaging in, but her chats are being ignored.",108,0,0
Ridiculously high bill confusion,"I worked for Nextel 17 years ago, before the Sprint merge. I was in the catchall customer service call center. We did it all, trouble shooting, bill disputes, etc. One day I got a call from a very angry man, he needed to discuss some over charges on his account. The customer had a fleet of phones, he owned a trucking outfit. His bill was typically $150 for one of his employees but somehow that month it was in the THOUSANDS. I was confused, he was confused. I started going through the call log, I informed the fella that his employee was making long distance calls late at night. Well. The man was upset. He prattled on about how the employee was sleeping in his cab at those hours so there MUST be a mistake. Ok, I investigate further. The man is calling the Bahamas. This caused further confusion with the customer, he again went on about the employee being asleep at those hours. So. I asked the man to hold, that I'd dig deeper. I pull up the phone number that he had been calling and dialed it myself. Can you make a guess of what I heard? A sex chat line. Yep. So I get back on the phone, by that time the man has lightened up and we were friendly to each other. I giggle then explain the situation. The dude was super chill and told me that he needed to have a talk with his employee. The call ended sweetly and the issue was resolved. 

Tl;dr bill was thousands more than it should be, investigated and found it was his employee calling sex lines.",569,0,0
Laptop Karen,"I worked at a call center for a very popular worldwide warehouse until recently right? This is one of the most entitled dumbass’ I couldn’t stand. 

So he bought a Lenovo laptop that’s super slow and all that. A month ago, he got an $80 credit as compensation for him not being so happy with it, only catch is you have to exchange it with the exact same brand and model, not one close to it or same brand but different model. No, the exactly same one. 

He wanted to return it and get a refund so he can get another laptop. We approved it. He spoke to someone before me and wanted to see if he can get the Apple MacBook Air this time instead of a Lenovo and get transfer the $80 compensation to this order. I can see he asked the girl before me because she left notes stating so and showing that she said no. I explained to him that he can buy what he wants, but he can’t get the compensation of $80 from the Lenovo. He argued saying that he had that laptop for close to 90 days and put up with so much shit for it. I replied saying, “no offense sir, but no one told you to keep it for that long. You could’ve returned it after a week and not made yourself so mad over time. You’re the one who decided to keep it for that long.” He kept arguing that he deserves it for the bother and hassle. I told him that I don’t make the rules and can’t do anything and since he won’t be having the laptop anymore, he won’t be having any issues. I also explained that I see the notes from the previous agent as well and she said no as well and by policy, we automatically have to agree with what the first person said either way (they don’t want us to seem like liars or whatever.) He said he thought he should try again because she might be having a bad day and just wanted to say no out of spite. I explained that no, she said no because those are the rules. 

He wanted a manager because I wasn’t budging. I told him no because there’s already so many supervisor calls waiting and so little managers available and I’m not going to waste their time just because he thinks we’re saying no because we ‘might be having a bad day.” He started saying things like, “excuse me?! Do you know who I am? Do you know how much money I make!?” So I said, “if you make sooo much money, why are you wasting both our time over $80?! If you’re willing to spend $1500 on a laptop, you can afford the $80.” He hung up and didn’t call back again. 

And yes, I know I wasn’t the most professional, but we all have had ‘those calls.’",181,0,0
Customer owes over $1200,"I know we usually complain about the customers but oh my goodness I sided with them on this call. So I get a call from a lady let's call her K. K tells me she got a very big bill from her dentist and she isnt happy. I pull up the account and there are 2 claims for her children that were denied.

Now just to let yall know, sealants on every dental plan always have a tooth restriction and age limit on them. On this one the only teeth allowed are numbers 2, 15, 18, and 31 with an age limit of 15. Now, I take a look at the first claim and see they enter the sealant code 10 times. We only covered two teeth. I explained it to the customer and she was understandably upset. 

She tells me the provider called in and we told them it was covered. I look into our call records and see that no, they did not call in for either child. I tell the customer and she wants me to check her son's claim. As soon as she says his age (16) I'm like oh no. I pull up the claim and sure enough there are sealants on 8 teeth submitted. Not even for the tooth numbers we would have covered. 

Ended up doing a member grievance for this poor lady to try and help her out of her $1200 bill that easily could have been avoided had the dentist office actually called us.",853,0,0
Barred out Karen’s,"I worked at a call center for Humanas Mail Order Pharmacy. It was only for senior citizens and only for those on Medicare. Literally about 85% of these members are either currently on or used to regularly be prescribed Xanax. 

We’re a 90 day mail order pharmacy, meaning we mail you 90 days worth of your medication. Everyone always joined assuming that they’d be able to get their Xanax, Percs, and other controlled substances for 90 days. I’ve had to explain too many times that by law we cannot send them out for more than a month at a time. 

We also are able to do short term scripts. So if you ran out of your meds early and will have to go a week or so without it, we can ask your doctor for a short term script (up to 10 days) and have it sent to a local pharmacy so you can go get a 10 day (or for how ever many days you need from 1-10 days) supply. 

Sooo many people would call in and try taking advantage of it. They’d call in every month saying they ran out of their Xanax early. A few even started yelling and crying that they’re going through withdrawals. I’m a drug addict myself (heroin and meth, I’ve used Xanax but was never addicted) and I can easily spot the ones who purposely abuse it and the ones who did take too many because of their anxiety. 

This lady did it for 5 months in a row, so by the 6th month we had to refuse to request. She was screaming and cussing at me saying, “I’m so sick and need my Xanax! I ran out early.” And was being so damn rude about it. Eventually I stopped trying to calm her down because I was mad and said, “look, you wouldn’t be out of your script or withdrawaling if you took it as prescribed!!” For the first time since that call started, all I heard was silence. She always so confused and shook that I said that lol. These Karen’s are crazy.",64,0,0

Customer complained about me,"I work high level complaints for a UK energy company.  Cust is having building work done and needs his electric meter moving.  Another company alters his service but we need to remove the meter beforehand and reinstall it afterwards.

I called him yesterday to tell him I couldn't book the job for him but I would try and find a solution.  He.  Went.  Off.  Shouting, swearing, telling me I wasn't going to help him, I don't care about him, he will sue my company in general and me in particular.  Whatevs, I told him I'd call him today and I hung up.

Spoke to a very senior manager who said we could try to get an emergency call the morning the work was due and then another one when it was completed.  Not guaranteed and not the best way of doing things but the only way to proceed atm.  So I call him today to tell him and he's immensely grateful. 

I then go to update my notes and I realise he called back yesterday to complain about me!  The notes say the cc agent apologised but explained I'm higher up than them so they couldn't do anything about me 🤣

No wonder he was so different speaking to me today, he probably thought I already knew he'd called in...

"""I want satisfaction""","I have worked as a CS representative for a large online retailer for a while, and it isn't often that I get calls that end in a very specific way. After all, people call in to know what is going on with their package and if they're going to get it. Very simple stuff.

However, once in a while I get a case that well and truly baffles me. It's not all that absurd, neither is it outrageous. All I can say is that it confuses me quite a bit.

I received this call a month ago. C is customer, BB is me.


&gt; BB: Heya, this is Blastoise from Azalea. How can I help?

&gt; C:  I have a package that's going into the West Coast. The delivery location for that package is on the East Coast in Buttfuck, Tennessee.

&gt; A shipment for the same item on the same order is coming to me directly and I need this package for an outdoor barbecue next week.

&gt; BB: Oh dear, I'm so sorry about this. Let me just check this package for yoy and find out what's going on.


So I check the package, it's being sent by the postal service and it is indeed going west when it was supposed to go east. I thought that maybe I could call USPS to inquire about the destination scans for this package.


&gt; BB: I can indeed confirm that it is heading west which is weird. We'll have to check with USPS about this since the address you entered is correct.

&gt; C: No no, don't bring them into this. This is Azalea's product you fix it.

&gt; BB: Um, sir. I get what you're saying but since this package is being shipped by the postal service I have to speak with them in order to get this package over to you.

&gt; C: No, I have already done my part and I expect that your company do the same. I have waited long enough.

&gt; BB: I get your point, and I'd feel frustrated about this too but I have to call the postal service about this so we can find out how to get this resolved.

&gt; C: Listen here, you people used to provide excellent customer service and I demand that same service now. I want satisfaction!

&gt; BB: ... I am truly sorry. I'll be honest, I would like to get this package for you myself, hand deliver it to you right now even. But since this package is how many states away, I can't just make magic here and redirect the plane this chair is in. Not without help.

&gt; C: I want this chair, I paid for it! Give me an immediate replacement.

&gt; BB: I would like to do that. I would have already done that if the option was available, but we can't replace items in transit that are still within the delivery time frame here.

&gt; I really have to call the postal service before we can proceed with finding our options here.

&gt; C: This is awful customer service. I'm not standing for this, get me your manager.

&gt; BB: I most certainly can. I just need to place you on hold for-

&gt; C: No, I am not waiting any longer. I am no longer shopping with you again.


How wrong he was there.

This was a ""No"" call, and I get that I snapped a bit on that last one. My dry tone wasn't helping since people mistake that for condescension most times.

I still don't know what that guy wanted me to do. This chair is still in transit and is within the delivery window so I can't replace it immediately, and even if we could the replacement would be arriving days after they needed it.

Since everything is in flux in our center, no real coaching was given to me until recently. So I never got closure as to what the customer may have wanted me to do or how I could have saved that call.

me - sir we won’t be able to put A through F on your account. That promo is only for new customers. 

customer - I AM A NEW CUSTOMER. i’ve never had X service before. now this is fucking ridiculous and pardon my french but i have been a loyal customer with you guys for XYZ years and i’m not asking for a lot. all i’m asking for is the same thing i get with Y. i’m not trying to take advantage i just want the same stuff i pay for with Y at the same rate. 

me - i understand but it’s just not an offer we have available for you. 

customer - as a matter of fact i’m standing OUTSIDE A STORE RIGHT NOW. let me go in and tell you what I see. there are posters ALL AROUND HERE saying get A through F for free. 

me - realizing this was a losing battle. i’ll have my supervisor call you.

customer - yeah do that because i need my same plan and i’m not trying to get over on you guys i just want the same thing i been paying all these years for thank you very much. 

context - this guy was getting A through F for free on his current plan. If he would’ve been willing to listen to me and didn’t have a little self guided conversation model already lined up before he started talking to me, I would’ve been able to tell him that his current plan is better, more reliable and cheaper. There’s no doubt in my mind that he canceled Y and signed up for X where A through F are not free.

"""I thought you guys would take care of it""","I really do appreciate the customers I speak to every day. Yeah, some people are assholes, but it gives me a chance to learn and get better at my job, so that when a decent person calls in, I can provide them better service. 

Sometimes though, I get people where the only thing they teach me is that human stupidity is limitless. 

Call comes in, and the person is the spouse of the primary on the card. No problem, wait, no, Wisconsin. Which means we need documented verbal authorization to speak with the spouse. Shame. I look through to check, because sometimes it's lost in a mess of other notes, but nope. Only authorization specifically says ""one time"". Oh whale. 

I inform him of this, and instead of respecting it, he says ""I'll just tell you anyway and my wife can verify it when she gets back from the store"".  At this point I'm just thinking ""I'll take a peek, see what's going on"". He explains that he's been continously charged for a bogus charge and that we've credited him before. Welp, that does suck. Still not allowed to discuss it. And I mean, I can see the information. I know he's telling the truth. But I'm not looking to break any laws, so I just apologize and say I can't discuss. His wife comes home, and authorizes him. Dope, we can discuss it now! 

So we start discussing, and he recognizes the charge, and he knows what it's from (it was a subscription service). Now, apparently this has been going on for a long time. As in, past 12 months had some activity in that regard, and he said it occured even outside that range (I couldn't see that far, so hey, I'll take his word"". Now, heres where I realized he might just be a total moron.

 ""Did you ever get in touch with [subscription service] to get it cancelled?"" 

""No, they never billed me. Why would I get in contact with them""

""Well, they'd be the ones to get it cancelled. We can't cancel it for you""

""Well you're the ones billing me, so it should be your responsibility. I thought you'd take care of it""

Dude. No. For one, they wouldn't speak to us about it, because we aren't your representative in anyway. We can't speak on your acct, or lack thereof, with them. We could've issued you a card with a new number. We could've cancelled the card outright. And you could've called them, explained the situation, and unfucked this situation long ago. Long before the 2nd round of bullshit. I try to explain this but he isn't having it.

So, I tell him I can't fix this for him except by processing the payment for the amt on the acct. He doesn't wanna pay it. Cool, I'll get you to fraud. 

I was on his side until he told me he never attempted to contact the subscription service. I've had to do the same thing before. Called the service, they said ""oh, well let's see if you recognize anything"" and when I didn't, they unfucked the situation and profusely apologized. I also went through my bank and got a new card, because if someone has my card info and is using it, I wanna stop it. Not this guy.

My Best Day in a Call Center," 

About 5 years ago I was working for a call center company that was handling the phone customer service for various companies. The company I was handling phone calls for was for handling HSA's, FSA's and HRA's (for those who are unfamiliar with those they basically are accounts that involve both medical and financial, so I got a double whammy to the frantic/rude customers).

I do not have authorization to retrieve that information. (M),"I work for a company that employs us by a very popular newspaper mainly involving the stock market and such to be customer service reps. I believe the title is something I say a lot to the annoyed customers. Mostly they are asking for the contact information for their local carriers. One of the convos I had with a customer went like this. (C - customer)

C: The carrier is very incompetent and not doing his job. What is his information so I can speak with him directly?

Me: I do apologize, sir, for the inconvenience. I can credit this missed issues here to extend your subscription term. I do not have the authorization to that information and will not be able to provide it to you.

C: I am the customer and I want that information! You work for XXX!! You should take the initiative to get that information! I'm not going to be hateful towards the guys, I just want to inform him that he is not doing his job.

Me: Sir, I do not have the authorization to get that information.

C: You should go above your superiors heads to get me that information! A company likes when workers take initiative to please their customers! You would not get in trouble!

Me: Sir, there is not possible way for me to get that information for you. Our delivery messages go directly to our distribution team and they notify the carriers of the issue. I do apologize for the inconvenience.

I want a reward!,So I work at a bank and had this happen to me. Customer said there was a deposit into his account by mistake. Mistake corrected. Customer was mad we didn’t give him a reward. He said that he shouldn’t have told us and spent the money. I had to tell him that can be considered fraud/theft. So now he’s going to tell all his friends to break the law because all we did was say thank you.,64,0,0
"Rude guests are one thing, but rude managers? I'm sorry, but no!","Please excuse any formatting issues. I am on my break, and am fuming.

I am currently only 2 hours into my shift as I start this, but I have already had 2 managers cop a nasty attitude with me for no reason.

Some context, I work the Complaint Department for a certain hotel chain, so I get to listen to angry Karen's complain all day about a Dorito that was left on the floor, demanding a full refund for the whole week(true story). These people are annoying, but you expect it.

Call#1

This was a simple call. Basically, this lady left the hotel, but no one was there to check her out, and it was the end of the week anyway, so she just left. A few days later, the hotel charges her for an additional 4 nights, and she's not even all that bitchy about it. She was so calm, and just wanted to get this fixed. Who wouldn't want to be refunded if they were charged for 4 days long after leaving the hotel?

I reached out to the front desk and spoke to the Team Lead, who told me that they went to check the room since she hadn't paid for the next week yet, and saw she wasn't there anymore. They got her checked out for that day, and charged her for the past few nights. I was just going to advise her and submit a case for a request to get refunded, but we still would have taken their side if they refused, since she technically didn't get checked out properly. But then, he got pissy.

Me: Okay, I'll go ahead and let her kno-

TL: You know what? I'm not going to argue with you. I'll go ahead and refund her, but you need to let her know that she has to tell us next time when she is leaving. She needs to take responsibility for herself.

Excuse me? I'm sorry, but no. I will not tell her that. I told her how long she could expect the refund to take, and advise that I was asked to advise her to make sure she checks out at the front desk, but I am not about to yell at this nice woman.

Call#2

A bit more of a complicated call, this woman arrived to check into her room, but was told there was no room. We are a reasonable company, and most General Manager's understand that it's not the guest's fault if there's no room. Overbooking happens, but sometimes the front desk is too lazy to actually pull up the guest's reservation and cancel it, so the computer charges a no show fee.

As is standard with these calls, I pull up her receipt to confirm the no show, and almost face palm. Back in spring, there was this weird glitch that made no show fees read as Advance Purchase rooms, which are non-refundable. I confirmed on her reservation that it wasn't AP, and was going to submit a case, but then she told me that she'd already called and got no response. I find her case, and sure enough, it was closed.

There was a note from GM stating that it was for the wrong hotel, and they put the address of their hotel in the notes, but the reservation, receipt, and site numbers all matched up with the hotel. It WAS the right hotel.

I call out to the hotel and speak to GM, and as I'm advising her, I bring up the incorrect documentation on the Folio.

She then starts YELLING at me about how it's not a glitch, that it's SUPPOSED to look like that (it's not), and that ALL no show fees are non-refundable. She's been yelling at me for about 2 minutes, and since our calls are timed, I try to get her off that subject.

GR: Okay, well, regardless, will you be able to refund it?

GM: It's non-refundable. She should have canceled it when she arrived at the hotel. That's not our fault. I'll go ahead and do it this time as a courtesy, but I won't be doing this again. She needs to be more responsible,

Excuse me? My jaw would be on the floor if my desk wasn't in the way. What the hell is her problem?

I go back to the guest, and leave out all of the stuff GM said. I tell her when she can expect to see her refund, and she was happy.

I'm just so flabbergasted. I almost wish the GM had refused the refund, so I could escalate the case to the District Manager. Had that been the case, I would have DEFINITELY noted exactly how rude she was, with quotes and everything. However, I decided not to, because I didn't want her taking it out on the guest and refusing the refund.",48,0,0

The Last Straw for me,"I was taking a call from the customer, answering his question, when he interrupted me with, ""Are you a human? You sound like a \[redacted\] robot."" I assured him that I am not a robot and we continued the call. After it was finished I went to my manager so she would know about it.    I told her how I was somewhat angry with the caller, because I am careful to modulate my voice, and vary my speaking speed so as not to sound monotone or bored. She agreed that I had a good phone voice and told me not to let the caller get to me. 

Two days later I discovered this call had been selected by the Quality Assurance people. They took off ten points because I did not apologize for not sounding like a robot. I started applying at other places (not call centers) the next day.",531,0,0
"Was offered a management position, but because of COVID they’ve rescinded the offer","On mobile, and English is first language so sorry for anything in advance. 

I joined a UK call centre that deals with technical support for a well known high street retailer. I’ve been in call centres for around 8 years, and applied for a Team Manager training role back in December. 

I was offered the role, but they delayed my start date because I hadn’t finished my probation then. 

After that, I had an undiagnosed gluten intolerance which meant I was off work for multiple instances. 

After a early probationary review, it was concluded that I was not at fault due to the fact that I didn’t know what was going on, and there was trial and error working with the doctors. 

COVID happens and so I’m furloughed. I’m due to return to work next week, and when I agreed to go into furlough, that my new position would start when I return. 

After not having any communication from management or operations, I got the email today so say that because of my time away from the business, and my prior absences they are rescinding the offer. 

So I am now preparing to find another job (wish me luck) and hand in my notice. They clearly only see me as a head that can take calls and not have my best interests at all.

No noise policy,"So, my sister is working from home, and the call center she works for ask that she can't make any noise, so even if our phone is ringing, they threatened to make her return to office, we need to be very careful to not make noise at all. Is this normal?",10,0,0
Finally got a Karen but was spared her wrath.,"Surprised I didn't have any serious Karens call until day 30 of my job. A few idiots, sure, but not Karens. I only know the date because this is a summer job, and I keep track of all my calls just to see how busy it is. Also, obligatory mobile alert.

So I help give people generic information or advice on the federal aid that Canada is offering because of the pandemic. Generic info means I don't know or have access to people's information, accounts, anything. I know how to respond in general situations, but I can't change anything about people's reports, details, etc. But I have several numbers to give clients in the case of them needing someone who can look at specifics. 

One other thing to note is all us summer student employees are working from home, and (I don't know if this has to do with that or not) I **literally can't** forward anyone to any higher up. All I have specifically focusing on me is a team leader who only really makes my schedules. And (one thing I had hoped to use on a Karen one day) I can't transfer them to any higher ups, because I basically have no higher ups. Just the team leader and people who know more information than me who I'm strictly not allowed to give their number out.

Anyhow, I  am awaiting a call (most calls I've had in my 7 hour workday, excluding my two 15 minute breaks and half hour lunch break, is 13 calls a day), and I finally get one. 

(Speech isn't exact quotes, because I can't be bothered to remember speeches on the phone, but you'll get the gist of it)

Me: G33kyArmy speaking, how can I help you?

Karen: Hi, I had called this number to ask about booking an appointment. I don't have a computer, so I called this number and someone was able to email a Service Canada agent about calling me back to talk about claiming E.I. They did call back twice, but I missed both calls, so I decided to call back and get that sorted out.

Me: Alright, ma'am, do you mind telling me what number you called me from?

Karen: ... okay, it was the [Service Canada number that is supposed to go to E.I. but at least one line will transfer to us for reasons I still don't know].

Me: Okay, I would advise you to call that number back, because one of the options you can select redirects to us, this call center focuses on general information regarding the benefit, we don't have access to accounts or details, so you should probably call them back, select a different option, and  you should be able to reach an agent who could help you.

Karen: I called this number, and an agent was able to email Service Canada on my behalf with my name and number and have them call me.

Me: I understand that, but I have never been told that I have the ability to do that. (Also, I don't know anyone who works for Service Canada, much less emails, I don't even know my own co-workers because we work from home)

Karen: Is there a supervisor you could ask?

Me: I'm sorry, we're all working from home, and I don't have the ability to transfer anyone anywhere. Again, the best thing I can advise is you call the number again and try a different option to reach an E.I. agent.

Karen: Last time I called this number, someone emailed them with my name and number, I didn't have to give my social insurance number or anything. But you can't make appointments over the phone, you have to do it online. And I don't have a computer. 

Me: I understand, but I haven't been told I'm allowed to do that.

Karen: So what is the main number that I can call- not the one that has a three hour wait time? But the main one. 

(You don't think the main one isn't the one being overrun with stressed out people in the middle of a pandemic, Karen?)

Me: The only number I can give is (the Service Canada number)

Karen: *Oh my God, that is **so** unhelpful! **Goodbye**!* [hangs up]

So thankfully Karen decided to not take her wrath out on me. I don't know who she's going to call, but if she does decide to be patient and call the number again, I feel bad for the agent who gets her. I would have made an attempt to hold onto the conversation better, but she was mostly put together until she got to the ""main number"" deal, then she Karen bombshelled me. Though, in hindsight, I should have seen it from the ""can I speak to your manager"" equivalent.

Although my next call was a sweet old lady who was very polite (called me ""dear"", that kind of thing), and was a refresher after Karen. Made me smile.",20,0,0

I cried on the phone for the first time yesterday,"I’ve been working in a call center at a program for children in crisis for about 2 years. Typically, people call when a kid is a threat to themselves or others, and we have someone from the program do a mental health assessment on the child. 

I’ve been screamed at many times for various reasons so it’s nothing new to me. I’ve cried in the bathroom or in my car on the way home a couple times, but yesterday was the first time I actually cried on the phone. 

So a nurse called in and I was trying to help her get this kid assessed. I’m not gonna go into detail because I’m still so confused by it, but she just started screaming at me that I’m not helping her and to stop transferring her around (I never said I was going to transfer her?) and I need to “get off my butt and help this kid.” I was like yeah I’m trying to. I have literally no clue why you’re yelling at me. 

Anyway after about 10 minutes of her berating me I started to cry and just tried to get off the phone as quickly as possible. My boss heard me and was really nice about it but I was still super fucking embarrassed. 

My boss listened to the call this morning and got really upset and said I did everything I could’ve done. Then she called this woman’s boss and complained👏  I’m really thankful she was so awesome about it and I hope this nurse gets in trouble and doesn’t pull this shit with anyone ever again.

Edit: I want to say thank you to everyone for your kind words and support! I did not expect this post to get so much attention but it’s so nice hearing from all of you. I do realize that the nurse I spoke to was likely under a lot of stress herself. However, the reason I was so upset is because I have spoken to probably hundreds of nurses/doctors in similar situations and they have all been very professional before. I’m not hoping she gets fired or anything like that, I just don’t want her to treat anyone else the way she treated me. But again, thanks so much to all of you for your kindness. It really made me feel so much better! And yes, my boss is awesome and great bosses can make a huge difference when dealing with difficult situations.",971,0,0
What is a Deductible?,"I have plenty of stories since I have been working in a call center for 2 years now. I am sure I will share more stories, but here is one that stands out.  


I actually work in call center for a health insurance company, so I help people all day with questions about their insurance. A lot of time was spent trying to explain to people what a deductible is. For people who aren't sure, a deductible is basically an amount of money that you have to pay towards your medical expenses before the insurance starts to pick up the bill. If you have a $400 deductible, you have to pay $400 before insurance starts paying anything.   


People hate deductibles and I don't blame them, however, I have never been so utterly shocked as to this story.  


""Hello, thank you for calling plan! My name is OP, how can I help you today?""  
""Yes I want to know why have X amount due on this bill.""  
""I can look into that for you!""  
I spend some time getting the account and claim information up.  
""Well it looks like X amount goes towards your deductible, so that's why you have to pay that.""  
""But I PAY my deductible EVERY MONTH! It should be covered!""  
Me: ...a few moments of silence... ""That's not your deductible, That's your premium.""  
""They're the same thing!""  
""No, they are not the same. The premium is an amount you pay monthly to have the plan, the deductible is a part of the plan and is an amount of money you have to pay before certain services are covered by the insurance.""   
""Well take it off then! I am already paying you my premium every month so that should have paid the deductible!""  
""I can't, it's part of the plan that you agreed to when signing up for insurance with us, and the deductible is not related to the premium. you have to meet the deductible through medical expenses.""  
""I want to appeal my deductible.""  
Again, silence. ""I can submit an appeal for you, but the deductible is a part of the plan that you agreed to having when you signed up for insurance with us. There's not really a way to change it at this point.""  


The caller yelled at me with some choice words for a bit and hung up. I felt bad for them, but I was so shocked that they thought they paid their deductible every month. I have run into people who don't know/understand what a deductible is, but not people who are adamant that it's their premium since most people understand what a premium is and how it works.

I am the most pathetic person this customer has spoken to,"The exact details are a bit fuzzy as this happened almost a year and a half ago, but I still remember most of the situation.

I work for a supply company that supplies specific businesses with specialized equipment, labor, tech, and just general supplies.  Most of the people who call into my dept are people who either have masters/doctorates or are peolle working for those who do.  This caller was a Dr.  

Our dept has two basic roles (we can do other things, but these are the only parts we really focus on) which is taking payments for statements/invoices or sending out invoices/statements to an email or fax.  

This Dr called in somewhat sweet at first just looking for a copy of 5 invoices emailed to her.  Typically due to volume of calls, and the time it takes to download invoices, we are only supposed to send out  a max of 3 documents, and any more schedule a person to send out more when we aren't busy (and since we almost always are, it could be days before these get sent).  

I am not a huge fan of that system, so I still do requests like this myself up to a certain point.  I confirmed the email she wanted these sent to and emailed them over.  

She called back roughly 10 minutes later (and by luck of the draw she gets me again) and she immediately has a change in tone.  She starts yelling about how the previous guy (me) tricked her and is the worst employee she has ever spoken to in her life in any place.  I get her account number and notice finally that this is the same person, and I try to see what is wrong by mentioning that it was me she had spoken to, and wondering if she was looking for other invoices or seeing exactly why she was upset.   

She doesn't really answer my inquiry and gets even angrier calling me slurs and swearing for around 3 minutes before finally demanding my supervisor.  I get her on the line and transfer the call over scared as hell and feeling really beaten down.  My supervisor asks me for the email I sent the customer and I oblige and forward the email.  

I didn't hear anything for roughly 10 minutes from her so I was really panicked.  Eventually I get called over to her desk, and I expect to get talked to about something really bad.  As it turns out however, the entire issue was that she received the invoices, was able to pull them up and view them, but when she went to print, nothing came out of the Dr's printer.  My supervisor had found out that the printer wasn't plugged in, and the Dr blamed me for that situation.  

I don't think I will ever be blamed for something like that again, but I don't think I can ever forget.


TLDR: I am a terrible employee because a Dr forgot to plug in her printer 7 states away from where I live.",54,0,0
you’re calling me a liar!!,"this happened moments ago. we’re a pretty small department so it isn’t uncommon for us to speak with the same people more than once when they call in. i had spoke with this lady on 7/16. she had spoke to another agent in our dept 7/13. called back today and spoke with me.... again. 

we received a refund to the account and since it’s a closed account, we have to send out a check

caller: i think i spoke with you last time... on the 16th? the check should be here by now. 

me: yes ma’am you did speak with me.
 and i advised you it can take up to 30 days from the date the credit was received to process the request for a refund, generate the check, and send it out. 

caller: well you people have been telling me for 2 months now that this check is on its way.... so where is it?

me: no ma’am. we received the refund on the 13th of this month. you spoke with another agent that day who advised you of the same thing. we haven’t spoke with you prior to that and no one else has told you anything has been sent out

caller: EXCUSE ME. i don’t appreciate you calling me a liar!!!! your company has told me multiple times for MONTHS that this check is in the way. so i suggest you apologize right now for calling me a liar. 

me: *sigh* well ma’am, i did not call you a liar. i’m simply looking back on my notes and reading what was discussed in previous conversations. the day the refund was received was the 13th of this month and you spoke with an agent that day as well. that agent did not advise you a check was sent. you spoke with me on the 16th and i did not tell you a check was sent. now we’re speaking again and im still not telling you a check was sent. you have not spoke with my department prior to the 13th and we would not have discussed sending out this refund check prior to the 13th because we wouldn’t have even had a refund on file yet. 

caller: ...... well i think you need to apologize for calling me a liar because i’m going by the notes i have wrote down. i’m sure all the calls are recorded so you can go through and listen to every call. 

me: ma’am, i did not call you a liar. i’m sorry if there was any type of miscommunication that’s making this situation harder for you than it needs to be but i’m just letting you know what our policy is and what the expected time frame is for your check.

"No, Mr. Customer, we won't buy your non-incorporated ""company"" from you for $5 million dollars","This is when I was working customer service for a major US cell phone company.

I was in an escalated department where we handled customer complaints, and customer letters.

This came in via a letter.  

It was very amateurishly formatted, like a C-grade assignment in a high school business class in writing a business letter.  In it, someone was offering to sell their apparently unincorporated cell phone company ""Revolve Wireless"" to us for $5 million dollars.  

The letter explained that he had a few friends that didn't have good enough credit to get cell phones on their own, and even if they did, that our company had a bad reputation, so he got as many lines as we'd give him, and he just leases out those phones to his friends.  He concluded that we should buy his ""business"" for $5,000,000 and use the name as another brand to operate under, to get around our bad reputation.

Well, besides the fact that it's strictly against our terms of service to sublet the service like that, I also did a quick online check of active trademarks, and he certainly didn't have a registration on the name, and I also verified that there was business incorporated under that name in the state he was writing from and no business account in our system under that name (and his personal name was common enough there was no way to ID him from that alone in our system, and of course he didn't include an account number).  

He DID include a phone number he could be reached at to ""discuss"" this ""business proposal"".  Well, I plugged that number into our system. . .sure enough, yeah, there was the account.  It was even listed ""C/O Revolve Wireless"" in the mailing address.

Well, if I wanted to be a jerk I could have started the process to have Legal look at it, and close him down for illegally subletting service from us, but instead I just decided to decline his request.

Besides the fact that I certainly didn't have the authority to approve such a deal, I wasn't even going to waste anyone elses time with this.  There was no way we were going to hand a 7-figure check to someone for this.

So, I dialed the number on the letter, the customer in question:

Me: Hello, this is \[MyNameHere\] with \[Company\] Customer Service.  Am I speaking to Mr. \[CustomerName\]?\\

Customer: . ..uh. . .yeah, that's me dude. . .(he seemed spaced out and incoherent, I think he was stoned, which certainly would explain the letter.)

Me: Yes, I am calling regarding your letter dated XX, XX, 2009 in which you proposed that \[Company\] buy Revolve Wireless, and your opening offer was to sell us the company for $5 million?

Customer: Oh!  Yeah, man!  That!  So. . .uh. . .what do you say?  When can I get the check?

Me: Mr. \[Customer\], we here at \[Company\] do not feel it would be in our best interests at this time to pursue a merger with Revolve Wireless, we decline our offer. (I was smiling as I said this)

Customer: . . .oh. . .bummer, man. . .I was really counting on that money. . .oh well. . .

Customer think I'm being rude,"So this happened in May, normal disclaimers. On mobile, English is my first language. No doubt there's mistakes.


I had just been transferred to a new campaign and was taking calls after the training. The systems were old and clunky and for anything we needed the customers details to get into the account.

Cast today - me(duh) -k(Karenzilla)

Me- hi there youre through to bucky at (company) how can I help today.

K- yes I have an issue with my order and I need it fixed now.

Me- okay not a problem, let me get into your account, may I have your account number?

Now at this point i hear her say under her breath ""please"" in an awful tone, which set me off. Im a very polite person and tend to ask things in the most polite way possible, however please is not always required in ever sentence.

I hatched my plan. After I got into her account I read out my script for dpa stuff, which is what we need to read out, no please in any of the sentences and I could hear her get more and more annoyed with me. I said to her I was going to speak to my advisor so I could get this looked into further and she said:

K- can I give you some advise?

(Me being me)- sure, of course!

K- not once in this call have you said please or thank you to me. It is utterly atrocious customer service and I will be putting it in my review of you and your company.

So i apologised, said that I had to read from a script for the dpa.

Me- im very sorry but PLEASE  let me out you.on hold while I speak to my advisor about this THANK YOU.

Making sure to stress every please and thank you. And it got her livid.

After fixing the issue and coming to the close of call:

Me- THANK YOU for being patient with me, thats everything sorted now and you'll get your item kn xx date, Is there anything else I can help you with?

K- no

Me- well PLEASE have a wonderful day and THANK YOU for your call. She hung up super quick.



Not much but my compliance with what she wanted really made my day. I hope you guys enjoy the read

Oh really?,"TL; DR Don’t blame my company for your stupid and threaten to take it to social media. Want to close your account? Done.

Although I should cease to be amazed at people, I still get surprised every now and then and frankly, it just makes me laugh. 

CM: card member, male, loud, opinionated, I would guess a real douchebag
M: me

CM: yeah, I was declined tonight. What’s wrong with you people? 
M: I apologize for your inconvenience, let me take a look at your account. Okay, I see that the account has a past due amount. Could I help you by taking a payment to bring it current?
CM: No, you people are wrong. I am on autopay and it should have come out. 
M: just a moment. (I review the payment history, clearly showing he has made payments through the app for the previous three months. History has nothing on adding autopay.)
M: okay, I don’t see where autopay has been added to the account—-
CM: you know, this is stupid! I have never had any problems with any other credit card and I make my payments and this decline is the thanks I get? I am just going to close this card and get on social media and tell everyone how sorry (company) is. This is ridiculous. Mislover never did this to me. I’ve been with them on autopay for years. 

At this point, I’m so over this cm because a) he has run up a balance between 5-10k and is about 1k short of his credit limit and NOW he is bent about not making $300 monthly payments that are barely covering his interest and some balance ; b) blaming the company because he is not set up for autopAy; 3) clearly knows he is not on autopay as evidenced by his most recent mobile app and online payments; and d) his generally surly tone and social media threats.

M: I can connect you with a specialist to close your card. 
CM: what? Close my card? (Dumbfounded and incredulous that I would not crumple from his social media threat)
M: yes, I can connect you if you would like to close your card.
CM: oh okay yes I guess so. 
M: thank you, I’ll put you on a brief hold.
Call into retention—-
M: (to closure team member): so yeah, this cm wants to close his account. (I share the details with her and we laugh.) have fun!

So I would be willing to bet that we did something to keep this cm, but for someone to come on the phone, blame us for his stupid and use loosely veiled social media threats — I’m done.

'can you reduce my debt?',"I work for a home energy company.

We seem to get waves of customer enquiries. One week we will get a lot of people wanting to change their energy deal, the next it's customers in debt etc. It's just the way it seems to happen.

Recently we have been getting calls about customers in debt wanting to pay it off/manage it etc. One customer did stick out to me in particular.

This customer called and they were £1k+ in debt for their energy. Just hadn't made a single payment in their time on supply. Didn't feel like it? Forgot to do it? I'm not sure, but a lot of money was owed.

M:Me
C: Customer

C: Yes I just noticed today that I owe over a grand. What can I do about that? I'm not working and I can't afford a huge amount to pay.

I thought, okay, the world is what it is right now, so the customer is likely to be out of work.

M: We can offer you a scheme to pay the debt off over a period of time at an amount that suits you. Can I refer you for this today?

C: oh no no, is there any way you can knock some of my debt off?

M: no

C: but the bill is so high the amount is too much

M: we have billed you using the energy reads that YOU are giving to us. We are charging you for energy that you are telling us you're using. Also you haven't made a payment since you joined us.

C: Well I can't afford to pay it, I'm not going to pay it. Il just leave (company) and not pay it. How do you feel about that?

I could sense the customer thinking they won over me with that one. I don't appreciate the tone they used either. Yes I work in customer services, doesn't mean I'm not a human. If you're a dick to me, il be a dick to you. Professionally, of course.

M: if you try that you'll find you won't be let to leave us. If a customer has a debt of over £50 on their account closure, we object to all energy switch requests. So you won't leave us, and debt collectors will be sent to you if you don't pay what you owe.

C: well I will consider my options and get back to you

M: really, your only option at this point is to pay what you owe

After a 3 second pause and a loud *harrumph* the customer hung up.

Do you understand how hard it was writing the notes after? Having to convey the message of 'CUSTOMER TRIED TO GET OUT OF DEBT' without actually being able to say that, to keep it professional?",63,0,0
IS YOUR ITEM DAMAGED?,"Excuse formatting, on mobile. 
I work for an online retailer’s customer service department, and regularly get customers who just don’t seem to want help at all. I took this call yesterday. 
Me - me, obviously 
AL - Angry Lady 

Me: thanks for calling (company), my name is (me) how can I help?

AL: my package arrived damaged I want a refund

Me: oh I’m very sorry to hear that! Can I take (insert account details needed for verification)? 

AL: *sigh* you should have these already. (Gives information)

So we’re already not off to a great start, but I can understand being upset that your package arrived damaged. AL goes on to explain that her order was fine, but the package had a large hole in it and she wants a refund for the delivery charge, and a replacement *insert skincare item* because she’s worried it has been tampered with. I can understand that, it would be a concern of mine too. The company I work for is pretty easy to get a refund/replacement from honestly, but there are certain rules for getting said refunds/replacements. One being that we can’t replace items from a damaged package unless the items themselves are also damaged. I explain this to AL, who becomes increasingly angry and is just repeating “no I want my replacement”. 

Me: AL, I understand you’re worried that your *skincare item* has been tampered with. I just need to know was your item damaged?

AL: no it wasn’t 

Me: are you SURE it wasn’t damaged? I can’t replace it for you unless your item was DAMAGED. 

AL: no I want my replacement 

Me: was there any evidence of the item being tampered with? Was the seal broken? Was your ITEM DAMAGED?

AL: why are you asking me the same question? I’ve told you no. I want my replacement. 

Me: I’m sorry, I can’t replace the item for you unless the ITEM IS DAMAGED. IS YOUR ITEM DAMAGED?

At this point AL goes off on a rant about how useless I am, how shes told me no already and she wants her goddamn replacement. I can’t get a word in. Then come my favourite words. 

AL: I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER

Now, we’re all currently working from home. I physically cannot put a customer through to a manager. I tell her that I’m not able to transfer her over right now, but I can arrange a call back. The wait time is 72 hours. I tell her this. 

AL: why are you asking? Just do it. Are you really so incompetent? Are you really that stupid? Are you just doing this to spite me? You’re fucking useless. 

Me: ok AL, I’ve done that for you. Again, our current call back wait time is 72 hours. 

AL: WHAT?! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I’M CALLING MY LAWYER THIS IS THEFT. 

Me: as you have now threatened legal action, I can’t assist you any further. A manager will contact you in the next 72 hours. Have a good day AL

AL: *random screeching*

Any other call center workers have terrible phone anxiety?,"I know it sounds crazy to work in a call center if you have phone phobia, but I gotta make ends meet somehow.

Finally Put In My Two Weeks,"I've been lurking on this channel or making posts regarding call centers for the last year or so. It has been a long ride, but I finally decided to call it quits last Friday and put in my two weeks. This is scary during the biggest unemployment rate in history due to the pandemic--BUT--I am pleased with this decision and let me tell you why. 

I am done. 

100% done with call centers/inbound sales forever. 

I worked at a call center for pest control sales. I sold inbound. It was a GREAT job for a while--I did very well--was a nationally recognized sales rep for the first year and a half of my job. Then things just went completely downhill, and at this point, I have no choice but to quit. 

To give you an idea of the stressors involved: 

1. People being assholes all-day long--People, when searching for a deal, are conniving little shits. They will try to manipulate you, cajole you, harass you, scream at you if you do not give them what they want. 

2. Incompetent management doesn't communicate with the rest of the company or its databases/business rules. Our company relies on communication between branches for services and corporate. My direct manager is wonderful and he does his job well. The managers at the branches, however, are absolute idiots with whom I have massive issues with--they don't know OUR rules over here at the contact centers/headquarters and therefore, we are often yelled at in emails regarding ""our incompetence"" when the business rules ""clearly state"" etc. As a result, we get a lot of sales stolen from us.

3. Incompetent corporate--don't even get me started on this one. Corporate is basically filled with money-grubbing animals. We have changed corporate CEOs 3 times in the last two years. One of them simply walked out without any explanation and the rest made so many changes in such a short time that it made our heads spin. We say, ""We really need this to change"" and if it does change to what we need, it's a goddamn miracle. If it doesn't, it goes in the opposite direction and penalizes us for things we were not previously penalized for. 

This is the first time in 10 years I have ever been ""prepared"" to be completely unemployed for a while. I am utterly wasted from this job and I have no choice but to leave. 

For the last 8 months, I have lost a total of 55 lbs due to stress. As in, I literally sit in my chair all day, with 15-minute breaks and a 30-minute lunch break throughout, and I don't eat anything. Once I get home I can't relax because I'm still in stress mode. I have not actually worked out in 7 months or so and yet goodbye 55 lbs. 

I almost stopped sleeping entirely as well. I might get 2 to 4 hours in a night, but most nights I can't sleep at all because I'm so stress-wired from the day previous. I already have PTSD, Bipolar Disorder, and ADHD so this only exacerbated the conditions. I had to go on FMLA. 

Within the last 8 months, the company has made so many changes I cannot recall what the company originally looked like. When our company was doing massive layoffs in October of last year, I remember venting, asking if I should ask to be laid off. Someone told me that I should because I will not recognize the company in six months and that it will be a nightmare. They were right. I wish I had listened. 

We now have changes so detrimental that we get eternally screwed if we fall below a certain ranking. This was not previously the case because it was an even playing field. They started tiering our calls after Covid and we started working remotely. Basically, Tier 1 gets the best opportunities and Tier 4 gets the worst. There was such an outcry from the reps they stopped it temporarily but then started it back up again due to better numbers. 

The problem was, we would fall into Tier 4 if we didn't match up with the new metrics right away, even from the two weeks previous to starting the new metrics. The reps that have succeeded with these new metrics resorted to cheating, changing account statuses in order to actually get back up. Kudos to them for being so highly revered they're virtually untouchable. I doubt Q&amp;A even monitors the calls considering how many cancellations they get. 

We have had our metrics changed 4 times in the last 5 months. So many reps have fallen into this death trap of Tier 4, and more will continue to fall and be forced into a pigeonhole or force quit. A couple have already called it quits as a result. 

They say you can get out of Tier 4, but because their dialer is so messed up and because we get the ""wrong calls"" (aka service calls) we are repeatedly penalized for calls that we shouldn't have to deal with in the first place (current metrics include Sales Per Call, certain products, and the total amount earned). So, we need to push/force sales onto people who literally can't afford it if we want to go anywhere. Problem is Tier 4 hardly gets any calls and if we do, they are either service or they are the worst opportunities available (bad debt, customers who are literally irate from the get-go, wrong number, service calls etc.). 

It is literally a death trap making you fall into a force quit so they do not have to lay you off. 

This sucks for me, but thankfully, I have a husband who currently has a job (albeit a shaky one) and is ready to see me less miserable. I can't collect unemployment because I'm in an ass-backwards at-will state, but I have no choice at this point--my health is reaally at risk.  My therapist and psych have both told me to quit, and I refuse to be fired. 

The last straw for me was when, about 3 weeks ago, I received a call from a customer who wanted to kill themselves due to stress and anxiety. I had to go through protocol, call their local PD to perform a wellness check, but the call rattled me so much I had to use 4 days of FMLA before even considering coming back to the phones. I was penalized for not turning it into a sale again.

On top of this, the longer I'm out, the worse my scorecard becomes because of yet again, more changes to our metrics. We are essentially penalized for taking time off. 

So I turned in my two weeks last Friday. I honestly need to be unemployed for a while because I am SO burnt out at this point that getting back to any job, especially sales or customer service ESPECIALLY on the phones, feels like an absolute drain. I am using as much FMLA and vacation time as I can to detox, but I don't think it will be enough. I told my husband I refuse to touch any sort of job application for the first week of being unemployed. I don't know about the second week yet. 

Kudos to you if you can last longer than 3 years in this job. I absolutely refuse, and I would be happy to never hear another goddamn phone ring in my life.",49,0,0
"The ""retention"" department, the enemy of Customer Service","A decade ago, I was working customer service for a major cell phone company in the US.

We'd often get cancellation requests for accounts, either in writing or by calling in.

However, any tier of regular customer service couldn't cancel accounts, only the ""retention"" department could do so.  We'd have to transfer call-in customers to them, and if they wrote in we'd have to call them, and then transfer them to ""retention"" (the terms of service were written such that you MUST call in to cancel, written requests weren't allowed).

(Also, technically the Legal department and Executive Escalations could cancel accounts but you did NOT want to get involved with anything they were touching)

In any case, ""retention"" was the customers enemy.  They were graded on one metric, and one metric alone. . .the ratio of requests they get to actual cancellations that happen.  To that end, that would engage in some very unethical (and probably illegal) conduct to ensure nobody quit.  If you wanted to stop being a customer, you had to be very persistent or lucky to get a ""retention"" person who would actually cancel an account, get a lawyer, transfer to another provider, or just stop paying your bills long enough and take the hit to your credit.

For a long time, we'd just transfer those calls to ""retention"" and consider it handled. . .but then we started to notice the same people calling in month after month, saying they've already talked to ""retention"" and were told their account was cancelled.  Sure enough, I'd check the account and it would say in the notes that they called in, were transferred to ""retention"", which would say that the call dropped, or the customer hung up, or that the customer had agreed to not cancel, which they would say they didn't agree to (or say that suddenly they were hung up on).

So. we started to conference call them with ""Retention"" instead of transferring, and then mute our headsets and listen in as sometimes they would be promised that the account is cancelled. . .while we'd look at the account and see it wasn't.  Or they just suddenly hung up on.  Or sometimes they'd make outrageous, silly promises to get someone to stay, like promising them months of outright free service. . .then not implement that ""plan"" (or document the promise) and of course they'd call in next month wondering why they got a big bill instead of free phone service.

Before long, we were told that we could ONLY transfer customers to ""retention"" and under no circumstances should we conference call in, on the grounds that ""retention"" has ""proprietary techniques"" to retain customers and dissuade them from cancelling their accounts, and we aren't authorized to hear or know about the techniques they use to talk people into remaining customers.  From listening to their calls, we realized that ""proprietary techniques"" was a euphemism for ""lying and atrociously bad customer service"".

We took the exact literal wording of that order and complied maliciously.  We'd transfer customers to ""retention"", then check back on their account an hour later. . .if it wasn't set up for cancellation, we'd call the customer back to check and see if they'd agreed to stay with the company (especially since account notes would always say they had, or that the call had dropped).  They almost never said they actually had, and were enraged to hear that the person they had just talked to lied to them.  They were told the account was cancelled, that it was over etc. . .but I could see otherwise in the account, and the notes the person they talked to said otherwise.  So, I'd note that I'd called them back, note the discrepancy in the account that the customer said their account had been cancelled, and send them back to ""retention"", this time with the customer very irate.  Usually this would get the account actually cancelled.

Retention was always very upset when we tried to transfer them over.  They'd start to ask if we tried to ""save"" the account and what we did to try to keep them from cancelling.  T

I left the call center around the time the arms race in cancellations got to there.  I presume that at some point the center I left was told to stop seeing if cancellation requests were actually being performed.",784,0,0
LET ME ASK THE QUESTIONS,"Long time lurker, first time poster. English native speaker. This happened recently so not exact wording.

M: Hi, this is Krazy, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?

K: Hi, my name is Karen, and I have a few questions. 

M: Absolutely, I'd love to help you with those questions.  Are you a current customer with us?

K: EXCUSE ME, I'M THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE ASKING QUESTIONS HERE. ARE YOU GOING TO LET ME ASK THEM.

M: Yes ma'am, I just need to know if you are a customer or not so I can submit this as the correct form.

K: THERE WILL BE NO FORM TO SUBMIT!

M: (internally: Ok....?)


K: Does plan xyz cover all  (insert problems here)?

M: Yes Ma'am, the plan covers all covered (insert problems here).

K: That's what I thought. Your website states you offer 24 hour service and that you cover all general (insert problems here).  I called a few times last week and told them about my problem and wanting to upgrade my current plan, and the people on the phone were confused about whether or not the new plan I was interested in covered (insert problem here).  I told them to have the manager contact me and schedule something that night and nothing was done! Y'all are false advertising if you don't do or know what is on your own website.

M: I apologize ma'am, I assure you we are doing our best to help you. Just to confirm you are a current customer?

K: Yes, and all I want is information about xyz plan and no one knows anything.  This is crazy I have not been contacted by a manager yet.  Put your manager on the line NOW.

M: I understand you want someone to contact.  Unfortunately, although I really want to be able to help you more, because I am on the sales team and not the current customer team, all I can do is take down some basic information, make sure I link your account, and then I will send this in to the correct department or manager.  You said your first name was Karen, what is your last name?

K: NO, THIS IS INEXCUSABLE. YOU GET YOUR MANAGER RIGHT NOW!

M: As I stated ma'am, I am just on the sales team and all I can do is send a message.  I cannot contact the manager directly.

K: THIS IS RIDICULOUS. FINE. GIVE ME YOUR SUPERVIASER.

M:  Unfortunately, I can't do that ma'am. As I said-

K: YOU PUT YOUR SUPERVISOR ON THE PHONE NOW!  I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER! THIS IS RKDICULOUS.

M: I am not sure if I can, let me put you on a brief hold and double check with my supervisor ok?

K: *Scoffs in unbelief* FINE. 

M: (puts Karen on hold and messages team lead. No one was available but later on it was confirmed I cannot transfer or put the team lead on the line, as we help multiple companies so we send this directly to the company customer care department.)

After 2 minutes I take her off hold.

M: I am really sorry, but my manager is busy talking with someone else right now.  What I can do at least is send in a message so they can contact you back. 

K:  Right. That is what they said last time and no one ever did.

M: I am really sorry about that. I promise we are doing we can.  Can I just take down your basic information so that I can send in these notes so that we are aware of what has happened in the past at the local office, as we are a national (ish)  company and cover many states?

An itemised bill is a powerful thing,"This is from about eleven years ago, when I worked in a billing queue for a large mobile network in the UK.

A woman phoned up huffy but polite, querying the amount on her bill.

“I can see from your itemised bill that your texts ran out on X date, and minutes ran out on Y date, so you started being charged from then.”

“I don’t see how that’s possible, how that many texts and calls could be made? I have loads.”

“Would you like me to go through them with you?”

“Please.”

“Well, I can see one number is repeated a lot. It’s that number the texts and calls run out on on X and Y dates.” 

“Could you read the number out to me, please?”

I do so.

“He said he’s stopped talking to her. Thank you for your help. He can pay for his own phone from now on.”

My heart absolutely ached for her, she sounded *so* weary. I hope she kicked his butt to the curb. Not the only time I wished I could give a customer a hug in that job.

Lady doesn't think I can hear her talking loudly on the phone about me.,"I work for a travel company and currently with everything going on, the rules are we'll be super lenient with changing your booking, refunds etc. if the booking is guaranteed to be effected. 

This lady calls up about moving her holiday, this is a local holiday and the country we're in you can travel, and as this one is at the end of September unless things go backwards her holiday will likely be fine, she may need to wear a mask on public transport or in shops etc but not much else. I explain that to move the holiday would come under the normal terms and conditions of the booking with a small transfer fee to move it, if needed we will adhere to any official guidelines to make sure customers are safe including distancing and masks etc, before I have a chance to say ""let me put you on hold so I can see about waiving this charge"" she moves away from the phone and calls her daughter who she's travelling with and proceeds to talk to her daughter loudly, and I can hear everything, literally the whole conversation, as she has her daughter on loud speaker too. 

She starts off telling her daughter I refused to answer her questions about if there will be procedures in place (I had, multiple times), told her she didn't like my attitude (professional, friendly and understanding she's nervous!), And that I was discriminating because she was older. 

At that point I shouted her name loud enough that she came back on the phone. Me = Me. Cust = Customer.

Me: Mrs Cust (said loudly not disrespectfully)    
Cust: Yes?    
Me: Mrs Cust, I'm sorry if there has been confusion, I can hear your conversation with your daughter and can say that this is our normal terms and conditions you agreed to at booking and is the same for anyone who's trip is still likely to go ahead, and therefore not discrimination as age is not a factor in this.    
Cust: Oh...you can hear?    
Me: Yes, I'm also sorry you believe my attitude is not of our usual standard. I can understand your concern but we must follow the company rules and government guidelines. I was going to say before you left that if you don't mind me putting you on hold I will speak with a supervisor to waive those fees.    
Cust: Oh...right...yes ok.

*Puts on hold, gets authorisation*

Me: Mrs Cust?

*On phone to her daughter again telling her about my bad attitude*

Me: Mrs Cust?!    
Cust: Yes dear?    
Me: I'm happy to say we can waive that admin fee for you today. Though please be aware if you move your holiday again we would have to charge it. To be able to move your holiday do you have an idea of when you'd like to travel next year?    
Cust: Oh no I don't know, can't you just hold onto it?    
Me: I'm afraid we can't hold money for you that is not against a particular booking, if we didn't move your holiday you would be liable to pay the balance.    
Cust: I think I might have to cancel then and lose my deposit. I'd rather do that.

*She goes back to her daughter and starts saying how she's cancelling, never travelling with us again, we have no respect for our customers etc etc*

Cust: Cancel it please.   
Me: No problem, I'm sorry we couldn't move your holiday this time but I understand. I'll get this cancelled and send you the appropriate paperwork.    
Cust: Thank you so much for all your hard work, you've been so nice and understanding.

*Call finishes up*

I told her I could hear her? I'm just glad she's cancelled so I don't have to risk speaking to her again.

I KNEW IT! I KNEW HE WAS A RAT! | Getting An Employee in Trouble,"This happened a while ago so will try to not miss any major details. The dates are in British format: DD/MM/YYYY and mentioned only to mitigate any confusion. 

A company owner (`CO`) called wanting to discuss one of her employees' (`E`) credit card. She was told by `E` that there were a few transactions made to a department store (`DS`) he ('E') did not make. 

On to the call.

&gt;	**Peace:** [Beep] Good Afternoon. You’ve reached Peace at `ABC Bank.` How can I help you today?

&gt;	**CO:** Hi, yes, I would like to report some fraudulent transactions on one of my employee’s card. 

&gt;**Peace:** Certainly `CO` We just need to do some security first if that’s okay?

*Security ensues.*

&gt;	**Peace:** So what are the transaction details, so I can locate them for you, please?

&gt;**CO:** There were two payments of £xx.xx  to `DS` on 11/06/2020. `E` is saying that he did not make the payments. 

&gt;	**Peace:** I see. It looks like these payments were made online. There were some further transactions before and after that. I’m going to go through them with you just to ensure we’ve got all of the fraud.

&gt;	**CO:** Sure that’d a good idea.

&gt;	**Peace:** There was an online transaction made on the 09/06/2020 to `Computer Store` for 

&gt;**CO:** Yes that is genuine. I was there when he made it. 

&gt;	**Peace:** Thank you. There was another transaction on the 14/06/2020 to Just E  

&gt;	**CO:** Yes that was genuine too. We ordered food as we had a late meeting that day. 

&gt;	**Peace:** ah, okay. And does anyone else have access to the card besides yourself and `E`?

&gt;	**CO:** No, we’re the only ones who have the authority to use this card. 

&gt;	**Peace:** Thank you. Unfortunately I am unable to process the transaction as fraud and will not be able to refund it.

&gt;	**CO:** What?! Why?! 

&gt;	**Peace:** Well, I can see that all of these transactions, including the one to `DS` were made on the same device ID and the same IP address. Since you confirm that nobody else has access the card in question, it looks more like the ‘DS’ was made by `E`

&gt;	**CO:** So he would’ve made the transactions to `DS` then because it wasn’t me. I knew! it. I knew he was a lying little rat! And conveniently he’s finished his shift and gone home. Ooh, let him come back tomorrow, I’ll be having words. Thank you for your assistance.

Lady accuses me of wanting her to kill her dog on my very first day working lol,"I’m on mobile so I apologize for any issues. 

I read a post on here recently that reminded me of this story and I realized I never shared this story with anyone so figured this would be the perfect place lol

Backstory: I take calls making reservations for dog &amp; cat services (boarding stays, play dates, daycare, salon appts, that kind of stuff). Ive been at this job almost a year now, but this call happened on my *very first day*. 

Now, this call was for I think a boarding stay, and happened a while ago so I’ll be paraphrasing obviously. Also, for dogs using our boarding and day services we require bordetella, DPP and rabies vaccines. Absolutely no exceptions whatsoever. 

This lady calls in wanting to make a reservation for her dog, and they’ve stayed with us before so I pull up her account. I see that the DPP vax has expired so I go over our verbatim basically letting her know we have to have the updated records and if the pet hasn’t received the vax yet, it needs to be done a minimum of 48hrs before check in. This is essentially the conversation that followed this:

Pp- pet parent

Pp- actually (dogs name) had an allergic reaction to that vaccine the last time we had it done, so he can’t have it anymore. 

Me- I’m sorry ma’am, but to stay with us the dogs **have** to have this vax and we actually don’t have any leeway with that policy. This is for the safety of (pets name), and we cannot have him stay with us if he hasn’t had that shot. 

Pp- ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?! HE **CANNOT HAVE THE FUCKING VACCINE** YOU MORON. HE WILL DIE. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? DO YOU WANT ME TO KILL MY FUCKING DOG??

Me- ma’am, again I’m sorry. However our policy is very strict on this and unfortunately if (pets name) is unable to receive this vax he cannot stay with us. Now, I would-

Pp- * cuts me off * AGAIN HE WILL FUCKING DIE IF HE GETS THIS VAX. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? YOU SERIOUSLY WONT FUCKING TAKE HIM WITHOUT IT? WHY ARE YOU DEMANDING I KILL MY FUCKING DOG?!

Me- MAAM. Again, I’m sorry but we **CANNOT** accept (dogs name) if he doesn’t have this vax. Now, as I was attempting to say, you can always check with vets who offer boarding as they may be able to accommodate your pet in this situation, however we cannot. 

Pp- OH. SO AGAIN YOU EXPECT ME TO JUST KILL MY FUCKING DOG. FUCK YOU. FUCK (companies name). I AM LEAVING REVIEWS ABOUT THIS EVERYWHERE AND I WILL BE CONTACTING MY FUCKING ATTORNEY AND SUING YOU PERSONALLY YOU DUMB BITCH. 

* click *

I was so fucking flustered at that point and low key questioning my decision to take this job lmao. Like I get the frustration, but our vax policy TRULY is for the safety of your pet?! What in the fuck did you expect me to do?! Not to mention that the BEST place for a pet that has any kind of health issues to be boarded at, is WITH A VET. Our associates are trained to handle very basic things but they are NOT vet techs and so many people can’t wrap their fucking heads around that. 

Edit- edited some spelling and fixed a few things since I was half asleep when typing this out last night lol. Also, I’d like to mention that this wasn’t a case of her being anti-vax or just not wanting to vax her dog. From what I could tell, she had always kept up on the dogs vaccines up until this incident, and there was another dog on the account that DID have the updated vaccine records.",190,0,0
Don't talk politics with me if you don't care about my opinion.,"Hello, everyone! I've been an avid reader of this subreddit for some time, but this is my first post here. I work at what I would consider a fairly unique call center. We're a relatively new company (under ten years in existence) and we primarily field calls for dental offices across the United States of America (and some in Canada); we will occasionally get a random client that's a chiropractic, podiatrist, nephrologist, etc., but we have a couple hundred dentists that we primarily answer for. For the most part, I enjoy my job. I will not deny, however, that it can become incredibly stressful. Most of the people I speak to are pleasant, The following is a recent encounter I had with a seemingly-pleasant person with very unpleasant views.

Yesterday, I was speaking to a patient of one of the dental offices we answer the phones for. He was very polite to me, despite knowing that I was with the office's answering service (many callers feel at least somewhat slighted that the offices are not answering the call themselves) and we were concluding our conversation when he inquired where I was located. I told him the truth: that our company is located in the state of Georgia—and this is how our small-talk about the hot summer weather turned into a conversation about politics. For reference, I will be ""Me,"" he will be named ""Yankee"" for our purposes.

**Yankee**: ""Wow! You're in Georgia? You're clearly not a native."" (Note: I was born and raised in Georgia, I just don't have a very noticeable Southern accent unless I go above the Bible Belt.) ""It sounds like Atlanta is up in flames right now.""

**Me**: ""Haha, yes, it's sure to be very hot this weekend, too.""

**Yankee**: ""No, no, I mean with all of these protestors. I can't believe that they're tearing down monuments--it's unconscionable.""

**Me**: ""Oh, well... yes, sir.""

**Yankee**: ""Listen, I may be a yankee, but I've been sympathetic to the Confederate cause. Both sides fought and died for what they believed in.""

**Me**: ""Yes, sir.""

**Yankee**: ""Well, if you ask me, those protestors deserve to be shot.""

**Me**: ""..."" (Stunned silence.)

**Yankee**: ""Well, in any case, thanks for all of your help!""

**Me**: ""My pleasure, sir, have a great day."" (Call ends.)

I spent a lot of time thinking about this call. I was and still am absolutely astonished that someone feels the need to so brazenly offer their opinions—during a call to their local dentist, no less—seemingly without even considering the idea that the other person may not agree with them. The truth is, I completely disagreed with him, and, either way, to suggest that someone, *anyone* deserves to be shot is something that I find downright disturbing and inhuman. If I was in a position where I could afford to lose my job, I would have told him just that.

I love my home state, and I love the South; despite what many people believe, it is a diverse place full of many wonderful people. The racism that our country's past is steeped in must never be forgotten but it must never be celebrated. That is what *I* believe, not that the caller ever considered to ask. I suppose that since I live in Georgia he assumed that I must be just as racist as he is. To anyone reading this, I urge you: don't talk politics with someone if you don't care about their opinion. And definitely don't talk politics when you call you dentist's office to schedule an appointment to have your teeth cleaned!

Thanks for reading if you made it this far, and I hope you all are having a wonderful weekend!",19,0,0
My first two-faced customer,"Around 3 years ago I had just started on the phones for a large insurance underwriter. I was employed to sell and service home insurance polices for a large very well known bank/building society. 
One day near the beginning of my time working there I got a call from an elderly customer asking for information on what his policy covered him for. I answered his questions for him and he was perfectly pleasant through the whole encounter. I talked to him for around 20 minutes and had answered his questions then the following happened:

Me: was there anything else I could help you with sir?

Man: No dear, thank you, you were very helpful.

Me: that is no problem at all, you have a lovely rest of your day. 

Man: bye dear.

Me: Goodbye.

Man: (before he hung up obviously talking to himself or someone else in the room) well she was a condescending c*** (sound of call hanging up) 

Me: (shocked)

Problem after Problem,"Hello everyone! Hope you are all doing well! 

Basically I had a customer who had called in because she wanted her shipping fee waived because she did not want to pay shipping. Not because she had a bad experience or something, she LITERALLY told me she just wanted free shipping because she didn’t want to pay. After she told me that I told her, “Mam I cannot offer you free shipping as not only do we use a third party company but this isn’t due to any particular issue (meaning like lost item, customer complain etc)”. I kept repeating myself and even explained again why we couldn’t.

- Customer: But it’s not fair!! Why should I pay a delivery fee?? It’s too high!!
- Me: Unfortunately nothing can be do-
- Customer: NO THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!! GIVE ME YOUR SUPERVISOR RIGHT NOW!!!
- Me (already regretting coming in): Mam even a super visor cannot-
- Customer: GET!!!THE!!!SUPERVISOR!!

So I put her on hold and get my supervisor. He tells me that he won’t take the call because this is a ridiculous issue. The company I work for is actually pretty understanding most of the time but then there are cases where like with other companies we have to draw the line. So my supervisor tells me just keep repeating what you’re saying.. I go back and tell her that nothing can be done but still apologized to her.

- Customer: Ok so for the compensation..
(Mind: Wait hold on...Compensation??)
...I will take these items for free and want free shipping plus a partial refund.
- Me: Uh..No? This clearly isn’t something that can be done and even what you’re suggesting isn’t allowed in any store. You must pay for the items and delivery. Since you waited, the best I can do is cut the delivery fee in half.
- Customer: What do you mean half?? I said 100%!! Do you speak English??
Me: Mam that cannot be done at all. So it is 50% off delivery and that’s it.
- CUSTOMER: NO!! THAT IS NOTHING!! I SWEAR I HATE (Insert company here) OTHER PLACES WOULD’VE JUMPED TO GIVE ME FREE DELIVERY!! I EVEN HAD A CO-WORKER GIVE IT TO ME BEFORE!!!!
- Me: What was that co workers name?
- Customer: Idk! How would I know that (we start EVERY call with our name and dept)
- Me: Well I’m sorry but I cannot do anything. I offered to you the 50% off because you had waited on hold and I didn’t want you to leave empty hand as an exception. However I cannot offer you what you want so I do apologize about that. 
- Customer: GIVE ME YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME!! ALSO YOUR BADGE NUMBER!!!!
- Me: I do not have to provide any of that information to you madame as it is personal information. However I can give you my first name, it is (not gonna reveal it here lol)
- Customer: (Started to yell profanity at me and insults) WHY!? WHY?! WHY!? WHY!?

And then she hung up the phone. Imagine all this happened for a delivery because she didn’t want to go herself, which is understandable due to COVID, but to get in such a rage because she doesn’t get her stuff for free is baffling to me. A day or two after, I get my supervisor asking if I spoke to a customer under her name. I said yes I did. They told me apparently she is calling to complain almost everyday about me. I laugh and think nothing of it until again later one of my co-workers in the same Departement tells me that she didn’t report me because she knows me but she wanted to let me know since the customer had told her to tell me about my bad service AND she wanted me personally to call back lol

I'm not sure if they're stupid or just not paying attention,"Today's story isn't a super interesting one. Just something I've noticed as a trend lately. 

Customer asks a question, I answer the question, customer asks it again 2 seconds later.

I work for a company that sells snacks. Lately I've been getting a lot of calls from customers complaining that their local stores aren't carrying their favorite brands (as if that's my fault). The call will usually go like this

Me: thanks for calling, how can I assist you?

C: (completely ignores my question) hey I'm jim bob calling from kansas city and here's several minutes of irrelevant background info that's gonna kill your handle time. Anywho my local store doesn't have my snacks. Did you stop making them?

Me: I'd be happy to look that up for you. Do you happen to have the upc code so I can look it up in our systen?

C: well I'm gonna tell you a long boring story that has nothing to do with this but the answer is no

I can look it up without the code. It just takes longer. So I'm searching while this idiot talks

Me: ok I found it. We are still making it

C: then why does [store] have it!?

We can't control what the retailers order. And we don't do sales, just customer service.

Me: it's difficult to say why your local store stopped ordering it. Have you tried looking online?

C: yes and they dont have it either!

I know you're lying. I just looked it up on Amazon. But ok

C: can you just send me a box as a courtesy? I am LOYAL CUSTOMER

I fucking hate you

Me: I'm sorry but we don't do sales here. Just customer service. I can...

C: You're telling me you don't have a single box laying around? You can't call the warehouse?

Dude this company outsources to a call center on the other side of the country. I have no way to contact any ""warehouse"". They probably outsource that too.

Me: I'm sorry but once again we don't do sales here. However I can...

C: well maybe your SUPERVISOR can send me a box. I'm not asking for much here. Put him on the phone if you don't know how to do your job.

Well she is too busy doing her job to deal with your bullshit. I'm not dealing with an escalation because you won't fucking listen.

Me: I'm sorry but she's busy at the moment. However I'm confident I can assist you. What I can do is...

C: ugh fine

This part gets annoying. You see we have an application that searches for local stores. However to call it useless would be an understatement. It doesn't show what stores carry it. Just what major grocery stores are in the area. It's about as useful as typing ""stores near me"" into google. Less useful actually. Because it only shows the large stores like walmart and kroger. Customers hate hearing ""I don't know"" so this will appease them somewhat. Even if it's not the right answer, they get some kind of answer.

Me: I can look up stores in your area. However I can not guarantee the product will be in stock. I would suggest contacting the retailer before driving down there

C: ok

Me: I'm seeing a walmart on main street

C: oh! So you're telling me they have it?

Me: once again, you would need to contact them to see if it is in stock

C: ok

Me: I'm seeing a kroger on spooner st

C: oh! So they have it?

This goes on for about 4 minutes until I list every store in a ten mile radius. I'm baffled by how stupid people are. But then I remind myself that nobody with half a brain is going to waste 20 minutes of their day calling a company because they can't find a bag of chips.",36,0,0

(oh this is going to be good - this line gets all the weird shit that doesn’t actually relate to my job most of the time due to our smart voice technology sending people to the wrong place, or they just don't know what they want) 


""Ok... Mind telling me and I ll see what I can do?""


""So I was in the pub last night after a few drinks (guy sounds older and quite hungover, probably mid 40s?) and I was out having a smoke and this guy showed me his driving license and asked me to sign his mortgage application as a witness. What do I do now?""


""I'm not quite sure what to suggest, let me speak to a supervisor"" (they ll get a kick out of this)


So I leave him on hold for a bit and go and explain and it's basically what I thought.

""Hi, I think that we won't be able to locate anything but if you have only witnessed it should not be a problem nor come back on you, but please be vigilant with your own accounts and maybe not sign anything else for people you meet in a pub?""

Why do people accuse me of lying?,"A guy called in last week about his credit card. He was adament that we closed his account months ago and kept pulling payments even though he didn't authorize it then kept returning them and calling him to say he was past due. 

I explained to him that his account was not closed just past due and that he had set up auto pay and the reason the payments were returned by his bank (an issue with the account #). 

But he would not listen to me. He kept telling me we closed the account and screwed up his credit and he knew about the returned payments already. 

After me repeatedly explaining the account is not closed and has not been and he had set up his autopay again then it returned for the same reason, he disagreed and hung up on me. I was so upset that I cried because it had been a shitty day. 

I got that same guy again today. I told him his account wasn't closed and was past due. He continued to say we are reporting him as closed. I offered to help him open an dispute because if the credit report is incorrect we would need to fix that. He said he already disputed it when it was closed months ago. There was no dispute being relayed to us. Offered him our fax or mailing address. Then he was mad because he couldn't email it since he doesn't have a fax machine. Offered him the address and he said no he would just pay a fee to do faxing with a big to-do. en told me that I was slightly more helpful than the previous people he talked to. 

Sorry that is long. I'm just frustrated because I just don't understand why people think I'm lying to them. Why would I lie and say your account is open if it wasn't. Plus he called us both times. So he knows he is speaking with us, so again why would I lie? 

Also he commented that at least I helpful which is more than the previous people he has spoken to. Like dude. It's you. You make these calls unhelpful.

Me: I'm sorry for your loss, sir.

Customer: Well, couldn't you all just waive the loan balance?

\*Realizes he has 40K left on the loan\* 

 Me: Well, we unfortunately are unable to forgive the loan balance. The best thing to do would be to refinance the vehicle under your name. I can still setup an arrangement on the account in the mean time.

Customer: No can do. I will NOT setup an arrangement. My son died in this vehicle, and they didn't find his body for TWO DAYS. You all wouldn't probably want the vehicle anyways. The stench is unbearable!

Me: I understand your situation sir, but we can only offer an arrangement or refinancing options at this time. 

Customer: Why can't I just keep the vehicle?

Me: Sir, you can keep the vehicle but you would need to refinance the loan or schedule a temporarily arrangement until you can get the vehicle refinanced.

Customer: Well, aren't their any OTHER options?

Me: No sir, not at this time.

Customer: Well you can try coming to take it, you're never going to find it! It's at my shop under lock and key and I will never allow you to take MY vehicle.

Me: Sir, it may take us a day, it may take us a month, it may take us a year. We will eventually find the vehicle.

Customer: \*Screams and uses various forms of profanity, most involving my mother\*

Me: Sir, I have given you options. You cannot keep the vehicle because there are no satisfactory arrangements on the account. You are not listed on the contract as a cosigner. You have not made any sort of payment or arrangement for six months so it's time to make a decision. I apologize for the inconvenience and am, again, sorry for your loss. 

Customer: Well, you can just shove that payment where the sun don't shine!

Suspected scammer to payment,"So, recently had to go through ANOTHER round of cyber security awareness training (I've done this course twice before this one and I've been here since April). So it's pretty fresh in my mind. 

Get a call from an ""Equifax"" employee, asking for details about an account to clear up some issues. Uh, no? First of all, I don't care if you're god himself, I'm not releasing acct information to you unless I have authorization. Second of all, you're calling about credit cards, but you're calling from another line of business entirely (it was an installment loan department, don't wanna be to specific). 3rd, even if I do believe you're equifax, one of them recently fucked me by using the phrase ""unreport"", and you still wouldn't be authorized. So no, you can't ask for details about a mutual clients account. You can go fuck yourself for all I care. 

I politely inform them ""Federal law requires authorization for me to discuss the acct with you, and state law prevents me from just using verbal authorization, so I cannot give you any details"". I was hoping that they'd get the point. 

The CM was on the back line! Well lookie there. That's convenient huh? So the CM comes on. I verify him in multiple ways, and he wants to talk to me over the phone with Equifax on the line. Read him the disclosure and we get into the nitty gritty. He doesn't want information, he wants to fix his credit issue. Holy shit, it was actually Equifax calling. 

He paid off the card, was wondering why he had a balance. We go into it, find out why (paid balance, two purchases weren't accounted for). He's handling it quite well. A lot of the issues on his account were infuriating and difficult calls with other people, he took it in stride. He asks for a courtesy adjustment on late fees, I provide it because... well, he's being courteous. First person who said ""I didn't get my statement"" and then said ""oh, well, that's on me"" when informed that it was electronic letter delivery. And he knew what email it was sent to. Like, who the fuck is this goddamn champion? 

As I'm doing that, he gets into a spat with Equifax. I wasn't paying attention, but he got extremely angry with them. Like, angrier than when I warned him about interest on the acct that may still pop on his cycle date (I paid before the cycle date, yadda yadda, logical argument against bank policy that won't change the policy). That lasted 6 minutes. But then speaks to me calmly, we process his payment, get everything settled, give him that heads up, and I'm about to say my goodbyes when he starts talking to Equifax again. Dang it. I won't give any detail, but it sounds like they fucked him pretty hard. 4 or 5 minutes later, he tucker's himself out, ""Ankor, you've been very helpful. Equifax (we both couldn't remember their name, which I feel bad about), this matter is closed. Bye bye"". Click. Works for me, release the call. 

It was definitely a rollercoaster of a call, but we're slow today anyways, so I appreciated something to do besides browse my phone lol",160,0,0

Usually this happens when the customer has dual band WiFi and they are connected with the 5Ghz, if not, turning off and on the router works. Like 90% of time this is the routine.

Today asking that to a Karen she freaked, because she just realized she is using 5Ghz on her house, yelled that she was going to demand us and asked to talk with a supervisor (BTW, I got ascended recently so actually I am a supervisor, but I have to take contacts some time). Basically she accused us of giving her cancer and the disease of the world right now by not letting her know her router used 5G.

She didn't understand that I'm not from her service provider, I just troubleshoot devices of other company's.

Pretty much I told her that we could call her provider so they can deactivate remotely her 5Ghz frequency, she said that no, she will handle this herself and that she is gonna suit both her company and us.

Honestly I had a hard time trying to remain professional and not laugh about her stupidity

Edit: Wow 100 upvoted, thank you all guys, you are breathtaking

Edit 2: 500?! Damn I love you people &lt;3

Carrier entered naked,"So I posted here recently, but just now I remember one call I had not even having a month on my call center. You'll love this I'm sure.

There was some previous problems regarding this for a lamp that arrived broken, and the customer was like 10 minutes complaining about it. I was already tired of that Karen but well, she was not being disrespectful, just annoying.

So here is the interesting part:

M: Me
K: Karen (tho she was right)
OA: Other Agent
TL: Team Leader
CA: Carrier Agent

Me: So the refund is already being processed. Is there anything else I can help you with today? 

K: Actually yes

*internal screaming*

Me: What would it be? 

K: A few weeks ago a delivery guy entered my house to left the purchase I made... 

(little context. It was a pilot feature that allowed that to avoid leaving packages outside) 

Me: Okay... And what happened? 

K: The guy entered NAKED to my house and didn't left the package!!!!! 

Me (speechless and mouth open): ... 

K: ... 

Me: You mean... Naked like with no clothes? 

K: YES! All naked and I have it recorded!!!! 

Me (trying not to laugh): Okay Karen... Actually since this was with our personal carrier service, we have a separate department that handles that. Let me transfer you with them and explain the situation. 

K: Please do!!! 

- Puts customer on hold - 

Me: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

TL and OA: Wtf? What happened? 

Me: Explains the situation 

TL and OA: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 

TL: well, transfer her, good thing is not our bullet. 

Then transfering the call the CA picks

CA: Hi this is CA from carrier support, I see that you are transfering a customer? 

Me: Hi CA yes... Actually I have here Karen that has a complain for this delivery... She says that the driver entered her house naked and she has a footage. 

CA: ... 

Me (thinking she will hang up thinking is a joke or something) : ... 

CA: YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME!! 

Me (laughing because I couldn't resist anymore) : I wish but she is serious, I doble checked. 

CA: But naked like completely?! 

Me: And looking at the camera according the customer. 

CA: Oh well... Please send her over 

I swear I could hear a facepalm from her. Don't know how did it ended since I transferred the call. 


By far the funniest story I have on my call center.",103,0,0
"""I'm upset so I get to bypass verification""","This just happened like 5 mins ago. Crazy rude old lady.

""Thanks for calling \*bank name\*. How can I help you?""- Me

""My name is Rude Lady. I need you to look at my account right now. My code is 1234. My account number is 123456789"" -RL

""Sure let me pull that up. Let me go ahead and get you verified and then I can take a look at your account"" -Me

""Okay my code is 1234"" -RL

We have verification pins so if you come in green with a pin you just give your pin number and you're good. This lady was yellow with a pin which means we need her pin AND need to send out an additional verification code via text or email.

""Thank you. What is the phone number or email we have on file?"" -me

She gives me both.

""Thank you. Are you able to receive a text message at that phone number right now?"" -Me

She tells me yes then proceeds to tell me who her cell phone carrier is.

""Thank you. Message and data rates may apply, you'll receive one verification code for each verification code issued"" -me

""Um what does that mean? I can't receive text messages are you stupid? Why do you need to send a text message I gave you MY PIN!!!! MY CODE IS 1234 why are you asking for my cell phone I can't receive text messages!!"" -RL

""Your pin is just one step of the verification process and you just told me you were able to receive a text message which is why I proceeded with sending you one"" -me

""This is BULLSHIT my account is about to get HACKED and I need to speak with someone NOW. Why do I need to get verified I gave you my CODE already its ONE TWO THREE FOUR"" -RL

Now this is the part where I kind of argued back with her because I just accepted a job somewhere else and am working my 2 weeks notice.. I cannot stand people like her and I said what I really wanted to say.

""If you can't receive text messages then why did you just tell me you could two minutes ago"" -me

""I didn't understand the question. I need to get my account looked at immediately if you could just skip through this because I gave you my code"" -RL

""No sorry I can't do that. Also, if you continue to talk to me in that tone I'm going to have to disconnect the call"" - me

""I'm not RAISING my voice this is my NATURAL tone"" -RL 

okay karen

""okay I can bypass the text message, I'll just ask you security questions instead. what is the annual percent rate on this account?"" -me

The security questions are basic account questions FYI. like account balance, last purchase, interest rate, where does your direct deposit come from. super simple stuff.

Rude Lady FLIPS out ""YOU EXPECT ME TO KNOW THIS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? do you want me to drive all the way to new mexico to my winter home to get my account information? my account is getting HACKED"" -RL

""i don't know, whatever you need to do in order to answer the questions"" -me

""can i please speak with your supervisor"" -RL

""sure but they're going to need to verify you as well and ask you the same questions"" -me

I was supposed to warm transfer her to our escalation team, but accidentally clicked transfer instead of conference. I went on her account and left like 5 alerts explaining that she get irate and yelling so I don't even feel bad. I have like 2 weeks left at this job and she was rude.

"“Sir, I know what my manager would say because he trained me”","Just another story about customers who make incomprehensible purchasing decisions. Following on from my last post, I work at a clearance electronics company who sells out of box and damaged goods. As with many clearance outlets, we don’t offer returns if you change your mind on your purchase or buy the wrong item. We will sometimes offer to take the product back however will take a fee of about 20% out of your refund to cover our initial free delivery and warehouse expenses.

You would be surprised the amount of people who buy large appliances (fridges, ovens, stoves, washing machines) and don’t take any measurements beforehand. One such customer, who had purchased too large a fridge, called in:

Customer: Hi, the fridge I have been delivered today is too large. 

Me: Oh no sorry to hear that. Are the delivery men still there and what is the size of your wall cavity? 

Customer: No the drivers left a while ago. The space is 850 high. 

Me: Yep, from looking at your order and the fridge specifications you definitely ordered the wrong fridge as this model is 1870 mm tall. There are a couple of options, we can return the fridge however there is a 20% restocking for delivery fees. Or I might recommend you keep it and adjust the cavities height if you want a fridge this big. Every fridge under 1870 is significantly smaller in volume. 

(By this point it’s becoming clear the customer took a gamble buying a larger fridge then he could fit) 

Customer: How dare you charge me restocking, you have advertised the height wrong! You think I wouldn’t measure my own fridge? I did so much research. 

Me: Sorry sir but I believe you are mistaken. Every site I’m checking, including ours, similar businesses and the manufacturer, has the height at 1870 mm. 

Customer: Well someone must have keyed it in wrong. 

Me: We don’t manually enter the heights, we copy directly from the manufacturer. The last time someone was on this webpage to adjust it was April 21st. 

Customer: So that proves it someone did adjust the height and now you’ve changed it back! 

Me: Sir, April 21st was months before you made your purchase. Also what benefit would we receive from changing our advertisement? Making our customers upset? 

This went on for a while in circles until finally he asked for my manager. 

Customer: I want to speak to your manager. You can’t charge me to take back something that was just delivered. 

Me: Sir my manager is not in today as he is dealing with (recent disaster) and needs to be home. You are more than welcome to call back tomorrow when he is in but he will repeat my answers. 

Customer: How do you know what he will say? Are you the same person? Do you know what he is thinking? No, you don’t. 

Me: Sir, I know what my manager would say because he trained me. I think we are not going to reach an agreement today. You are more than welcome to call back tomorrow and speak to (manager).

Customer: Hangs up. 

Interestingly he didn’t call back for my manager the next day so I think he knew he made the mistake and would prefer the larger fridge. This is probably my proudest moment of not caving to demands. I’m so glad my company supports us and does not enforce putting up with these customers.",879,0,0

Credit rating,"I honestly had a really solid day. Only 1 real fucking moron, who wasn't mean or rude or anything, just extremely stupid (uses card, doesn't receive bill, doesn't think to call 🙄), even had a customer's wife agree CA is a silly place, so not to bad a day. 

But all the people who wanted to discuss credit just... fuckin hell. I understand, credit is important. I understand that it's concerning. But I'm not allowed to discuss your credit. I'm only allowed to inform you whether or not we are reporting to the credit agencies. I'd love to explain we only report every 30, 60, and 90 days, but I was explicitly told not to. We also have to report it accurately. 

1 lady kept asking me  to make sure not ding her credit because earlier in the month some fuckstick said ""it's up to you if you wanna pay"". She wasn't 30 days past due so we wouldn't report it, but that's not allowed to be said because someone at some point, sued or complained because of what someone on the phone told them. So I tried my best to assure her and not get dinged. 

Another 10 people asked about it, but at least respected when I told them I'm not allowed to discuss it at length. 

But this last person... so, it was a minute before lunch and she calls in. Her autopay fucked up, which sucks, and I did feel bad we were reporting her as past due, because her other 3 cards are paid properly. She also paid the majority of her bill before calling, so it was clearly a real error. And then the calamity of errors that led to me taking her (not totally unreasonable) call.  First she calls to clear it up, and the person she spoke with explains we can't discuss credit, but we have credit experts! So she transfers them, not to our credit specialists, but to fucking Experian. Okay, no big deal right? They're literally a credit reporting bureau! No. No no no. Apparently, this sack of fuck tells her ""the only way to remove it is for [Bank] to unreport it"". Which, hey, that's correct! What he neglected to tell her is that we are required by federal law to report fairly and accurately. She was past due. To ""unreport"" it, we'd be risking liability if we can't explain why we changed it. ""Courtesy"" is not a valid reason. And the only way we'd unreport it is if it was an error on our end  

And I still can't discuss any of this. I'm not allowed to tell her any of this. So, I have to get her to a credit specialist. But they have reduced hours due to covid! They have a 4 hour window where people can call to get help. So customer has to walk away, having to rearrange their schedule to make the call, and it's all going to be for nothing because the autopay error was on her end. 

Just an ultimately frustrating experience. Didn't even mean for it to get this long lol but c'est la vie. Thanks for reading my rant lol",151,0,0
Why did you reject my check??,"I work for a pretty popular bank that offers online bank accounts. I love my job but this is customer service so youre bound to get... KAREN. 

Sorry for formatting, am on mobile. tldr at the bottom

So karen called in because her IRS tax payment check bounced due to NSF. She had a line of credit on her account but it wasn't enough to cover the charge so her check rejected and she got a fee.

Karen: Why did you reject my check? I have plenty of money in my accounts!

Me: well there weren't funds available in the checking account and we can't just pull money from your other accounts without your permission.

Karen: IVE BEEN WITH THIS BANK FOR 25 YEARS AND I DO NOT DESERVE THIS I HAVE $10000 IN YOUR BANK etc. etc.

Me:well I'm sorry you feel that way but if we pulled money from your other accounts on every overdraft, someone could clean out everything with 1 check and be done with it

Karen: I dont care! That was my tax payment!

Me (muted so karen doesn't hear): if it was so important, why didn't you make sure there was money in there???

Me: I'm sorry but we cannot force a check through and overdraft your account more than what is already allowed.

Karen: well then I will close my accounts and take my $10k elsewhere!

Me realizing we won't have to deal with her: well if you feel that way we won't force you to stay here. Have a great night!

Free still isn't good enough,"This just happened.. my blood is still boiling so i thought I'd come here and vent. **WARNING... LANGUAGE**

This ""lady"" calls in and right off the bat, complains that it is unacceptable she was on hold for 10 minutes before she called me. 

Read that again. She had already called to complain about this same issue, was told my department can't handle the request, held for 10 minutes, then called back to my department while still on hold. 

So after her nonstop complaining about the hold time, she gets to the issue: we sent her the wrong color phone. So ok, easy enough to fix.. wrong. 

She wasn't just sent a phone... she was having an issue with her out of warranty device, and the person she talked to went out of her way to not only *replace* it free of charge, but also send her a new model (iPhone 7 16gb to an iPhone 8 64gb). Awesome, right? Wrong again. 

She wanted silver or gold. She got black. THE FUCKING AUDACITY. Here we are, a grown ass woman, having a legit fucking fit over a FREE UPGRADED PHONE. I haven't even been able to speak since she's been screaming the whole time. 

Finally, i let her know because of the courtesy of the previous agent going above and beyond for her, it's something that would require a supervisor approval, which is why we tried to get someone before. 

She starts screaming again about how she paid a thousand dollars for her phone (an iPhone 7, free with promotion.. sure) and we better make it work. She kept screaming ""just fucking fix it!"" over and over. 

I tell her i was trying to get someone if she could please hold,  to which she replied, ""yeah now i gotta wait because you people all working from home""

Wtf.

I respond by telling her, why yes, we are working from home but that doesn't change the time it takes for someone to review your account.

Ask for interpeter its okay,"So at my job, we can not ask the customer if they need an interpreter. The customer needs to express the need for one or speak english to us. Normally this isnt a problem. A lot of second language folks ask for an interpreter right off the bat. 

I am bilingual, i handle spanish queues and English queues. But lots of our Portuguese customers push the Spanish option instead of getting a translator. Which is fine because most of the numbers and words are very smilar or have a same root. 

After two years i can discern what their intent is and payment amounts. But there are times when they go into full blown conversation and i lose them. I know for a fact it is frustrating you having to repeat yourselve, i know i feel like shit saying I don't understand.

So please, if you can not hold good conversational english ask for an interpreter. Because its better than me saying i dont understand or you saying huh. And some companies may not allow us to ask or assume like mine.",34,0,0

No I don't know what your bill will be next month!,"Escalated complaints handler for a UK energy company.

Cust: I'm changing provider.  I'll make my monthly payment of £175 on 5 August and then if the change goes through in the middle of August what will my balance be?

Karen: Yes. I still don't see the tip I was forced to give the driver.

Me: Ma'am, you won't see the tip on your receipt because the tip goes to the shopper and the delivery service. That money does not go to us. Additionally, if the receipt doesn't show a delivery fee, you weren't charged one.

Karen: Oh. I was still charged for the tip though. How much is the tip?

Me: $5.13

Karen: What? I gave him a $2 because all of my frozen items were starting to thaw (she lives in Texas and it's July). Tips are based on the quality of the service you receive, not just given.

"""You're out of your depth""","Dunno why a lot of people are abusive on the phones, but this guy was abusive because he's a miserable old fuck who thinks he has all the right in the world to be an asshole.

Inbound call, so do the whole intro. I talk low, and can speak fast. Most people say ""hey, can you repeat that a bit louder and slower"". No problems at all. This guy decided that yelling was the solution. He yells that I talk to low, and need to slow down. Also I apparently sound like the person who hung up on him. As the call went on, I figured out why they hung up his ass. 

So he tells me the problem before I can see the acct, which is ever so fucking helpful, and then I pull the account. Amt due of blah blah blah, yadda yadda and wants to know why. He sent in a payment, which is lovely and all, but it has to cover the amt due. He paid about a third. Apparently he thought it was okay because he left a note explaining he hadn't received the item he ordered. But also said they came in. Wtf dude, okay, so you didn't pay the full bill, you're confused why it's higher than normal? Okay buddy. I politely explain ""well sir, a note with the check isn't an official dispute. He laughs and says ""I don't care about the dispute process"". Neat. Thats not my issue. 

During this, when I tried to speak, he would cut in, and then act like I interrupted him. Thanks asshole, real classy. He made this a habit. 

So I start going over the bill. He interrupts me, again, again acting like he had the floor. I trip up, and he jumps on it. ""You're clearly out of your depth"". No, I'm not. You're just a prick. Your issue isn't even complex, you're just a fucking idiot. You didn't pay your full bill, you were assessed a late fee, rightfully at that, and then you had another charge. But yeah, I'm out of my depth. Oookay. 

At this point I'm fed up. I'm not smiling while I speak, and I'm just trying to get it over with. After the 6th time of him pulling the whole ""nyuh you were speaking but clearly you're interrupting me"" bullshit I tell him ""sir, I am trying to help you. I want to find the solution and get this taken care of"". Not in the politest tone, so he decides to get even more ornery. ""I hope these calls are recorded so they can see your ability"" ""yes sir, they do record my line, so they will hear this"". 

Cue guffaw, and ""this is so fuckin stupid""  I begin to start speaking and he says ""and now you're going to talk about my swearing and hang up on me"". ""No sir, I don't care about your swearing, and I won't hang up I want to help you solve this"". And that's why you got hung up on. You were abusing someone, and they didn't have to take it, so they fuckin didn't. Only reason I'm not showing you the door either is because you're clearly angry that you're stupid and no one else needs to deal with that. 

So we go over everything, I waive the late fee ""because of his long business relationship with [Bank] and his great payment history"". We get the new balance, and he says he'll send in a check. Lovely, can you fuck off already?

Then it's his time to complain about the bill. ""It's not itemized"". Bull. Fucking. Shit. I was literally looking at another person's statement right before this call. I know our bills are itemized. But no no, they can't be because he said so. Aight dude, I don't get paid enough to walk you through your paper bill if you can't bother reading it all. ""Oh but you don't care"" ""I will pass your complaint up the chain"". 

He scoffs, and I mean, fair, I'm not telling my boss that the customer thinks the bills aren't itemized when they are. He mutters some other shit, I tell him to have a nice day and he hangs up. 

I had a rough weekend. I'm tired. I do not give a single fuck about how you treat me because I definitely abused myself worse over the weekend. I just want to figure this out so you can go away. I even said ""sir, I'm trying to help. I don't know why you're being so combative"". No answer. Just more nastiness about me being incompetent. Like, fuck off dude. I leave a wake of feel good calls in my path, just because you're a miserable old fuck who fucks himself and gets mad at everyone else doesn't mean I'm going to stoop to your level so you can have the satisfaction of making someone else's life harder. 

Now if you'll excuse me, my eyes rolled under my couch during the call and I need to recover them.",115,0,0
"I'm a klutz, so PAY ME!!!","I work in the Complaint Department(CD) for a certain hotel chain, and to day has been a weird day

Normally, I get all sorts of calls from Karen's who make a mountain out of an ant hill, but at least they usually have something to actually complain about. ""My room wasn't cleaned!"" ""They didn't have X amenities that you said they'd have"" ""The hotel was rude to me!"" ect.

While these people are annoying and clearly entitled, I at least can understand that something happened that could have been prevented. This one though... This one hurt my brain.

Me: Thank you for calling CD, my name is OP, can I get your name please?

K: Klutz

Me: Thank you K, how can I help you today.

K: I fell and busted my knees, and I can't get a hold of the General Manager(GM).

Me: (pause to see if there's anything else) I'm sorry to hear that, I'd be equally as frustrated if I had so much trouble getting a hold of the GM. Did you say that you hurt your knees?

K: Yeah, I had to be hospitalized.

I get a little confused, because I'm not sure if she's calling about being hurt, or is trying to use her injury to get out of paying rent. I paused again and try to wait for her to continue, but no such luck.

Me: So, are you out of work and unable to pay your rent?

K: No no, I'm just stuck in my room now.

Me: May I ask how you fell?

K: I was bringing my stuff in from my car, and I fell.

Me: Okay, so you feel in the parking lot.

Finally I think I'm getting somewhere. She's clearly calling because she fell and hurt herself. Maybe she tripped over a pot hole or something?

K: No, it was in front of the door.

So much for that. I can't just ask her how the hotel is involved with her fall, so I continue to probe.

Me: Do you know what caused you to fall?

K: No, I really don't know what caused me to fall.

I finally realize that I'm not getting anywhere with this. But, maybe I'm wrong, and the fall really doesn't have anything to do with why she's calling?

Me: So, what are you looking to get?

K: I want to be compensated for my injury.

Nope, it has everything to do with why she was calling. She wants the hotel to compensate her because she was clumsy and fell all on her own. I'm done with her at this point. I know I can't just tell her that she can't expect the hotel to pay for her clumsiness, and that she's crazy to think she actually has a case here, so I just do I know she wants me to do.

Me: Alright, I'll go ahead and submit a case to GM, who should reach out to you in X amount of time.

K: Thank you so much.

You're not welcome.

Me: You're welcome, is there anything else I can help you with?

K: No, that's all.

Me: Well, thank you for calling CD. Have a good day.

I'm not sure what's more dumbfounding. The fact that she's stupid enough to think that simply falling on the property is enough to demand freebies, or the fact that she was so calm and mater of fact, that you wouldn't believe she was asking for something so unreasonable.",91,0,0
A nice call as a palate cleanser,"So, a few days ago, a lady called saying she had been billed for a service that had already been cancelled. I ask for the service number, fiscal number of the holder, and set about analysing the situation.

Service belonged to the caller's late father, cancelled very late last month, I check the last bill, and everything is in order, dates and values wise. I get on the call, and inform the client about this (after offering my condolences for her loss) .

Caller: But I cancelled the service last month, why am I getting a bill now?

Me: Well you see, our bills are always about the prior month, not the month they're sent out in.

Caller: But it says it's July's bill!

Me: Yes, because that's when it was sent out, but if you check the pdf attached to the billing email-

Caller: Let me open it to check alongside you.

Me: Sure, go ahead.

She opens it, checks where I tell her, and sure enough, she sees it's all right and it's indeed the last bill for the last month the service was active.

Caller: Alright, I see now, thank you for explaining, could you check something else for me while we're talking?

I check the status on contract updating on the services that remained active after her father's passing, transfer her for another department to take care of a last situation, and that's the call.

Could have gone badly, because I could tell she wasn't too happy when the call started, but it all worked well.",30,0,0
My first experience with a Karen,"So this was a couple hours ago and it still shocks me until now. I work in reservations for a 3rd party hotel website and I get this call. She was all nice and I thought wow great! After getting her room type and preferences and answering her questions I proceed to get her a room. At $91 before tax and fees. After getting all the necessary information from her we get on the cancellation policy and I tell her it is non refundable and she went absolutely ballistic.

She demanded I give her the rate for $91 and make it refundable. After telling her that we cannot do that she went for her trump card. ""I want to speak to your manager."" At that point I was getting flustered, I asked her why. 

Karen: This is bad customer service, I'm getting upset here because this is a crappy situation. Let me talk to your manager.

As per policy we only follow our rates and policy, I informed her that it would be useless as she would get the same answer as I have given her. She cannot get the room for $91 and have it refundable. 

She then went on demanding for names and location and per policy I can only give her my first name and my general area. That was not enough. After getting berated for 15 mins straight I managed to get a word out and inform her to call this number to get the hotel manager to book her a room with the same rate and refundable. (This is actually against policy but at this point I don't have a way out and she wouldn't hang up.)

She took the number down and still demanded to talk to my manager so she can issue a complaint about the bad customer service she experienced. 

I've had enough at this point and my Manager refusing to take the call to inform her that per the policy we cannot grant her request. So I put her on hold and transferred her to Customer Service, I apologize for the poor CS rep that had to deal with her but that was the only way out that my TL informed me. 

So yeah, everything was going swell and then my first ever Karen ruined my perfect day and destroyed my concentration.",116,0,0
". . .but he was on a church trip to Branson, Missouri that weekend!","A little over decade ago I was answering billing disputes for a cell phone company.  I was in a call center taking complaints that had been escalated from first-tier customer service.

A woman called and said there was some kind of fraud on her son's phone, that it must have been cloned.  Why?  There were international roaming charges on it from Canada.  She insisted that he's never been to Canada, that they live in Colorado and nobody in the family has even been CLOSE to Canada before.

So, I start checking the account.  Sure enough, there's international charges from Canada to the US on one line.  I look closer. . .the calls were all made in one weekend, and one of the calls made from Canada was to the mother's phone.  Also, I check the call data and going by the towers, apparently the calls were made from the vicinity of a ski resort.

There are no calls on that line made from anywhere else but Canada that weekend, besides a few apparently on an interstate between Colorado and the ski resort.

I had to tell this mother that I couldn't remove the charges, since it was clear that the phone wasn't cloned, it was taken to Canada for the weekend.

""That's impossible.  He's never been to Canada, he was on a church trip to Branson, Missouri that weekend!  He even called me from Branson when they got to the hotel!""  Well, I could tell he called her when he got where he was going, but it sure as heck wasn't Branson.

Uh huh.  Well, I wasn't allowed to call anyone a liar.  If I said he was lying, I could be fired.

""Ma'am, I can't say where your son was, but I can say that his phone went to Canada that weekend.""  I reiterate what I'd found about the call records, and that going by the records and evidence, I couldn't remove the charges, and I couldn't declare that the phone was cloned.

She was confused, and didn't know what to think.  She hung up still bewildered as to what was going on.

Client asks if that’s 2 hours Eastern or Pacific time. I kept saying just try in 2 hours. Apparently she must of thought that it would be more time because of a time difference. Then was upset that she wouldn’t get any compensation for the outage and asked to speak to a different person. With me being a manager, I’m the highest person she can talk to.

I'll sue you for calling 911 for me!,"About a decade ago, I was working customer service for a large cell phone company.  My specific assignment was handling customer complaints, either as letters or as complaints lodged with first-tier customer service.

I had a case of a guy who said he had thousands of dollars of fraudulent international roaming on his account.  Okay, that's serious, so I look at his account.

Sure enough, his last phone bill was for about $5000, of which most of that was international roaming.  Well, I look closer.  The roaming is on ALL the lines on the account.  Then looking at the call histories, there are calls from the Los Angeles area. . .then a gap of a few hours. . .then calls from the Miami area. . .then a few hours later the international roaming begins with cruise ship roaming.

So, the more I dig into it, it's clear the guy took his whole family on a Caribbean cruise, found out they had phone signal on the cruise ship (which counts as international roaming) and phone signal on every island they went to (also international roaming) and they were constantly talking on their phones the whole time.

Well, I can't take that charge off the bill.  The most I could do would be to give $500 off as a courtesy if he acknowledged he was wrong and I explained to him the nature of international roaming and his phone plan and he understood it.  

Well, I call the guy.  When I try to break it to him, as politely and professionally as I could, that I cannot take those charges off the bill, he starts raising his voice at me, screaming, blustering, talking about  how rich and powerful and important he is and how I better take that charge off the bill if I know what's good for me.  Well, that wasn't going to make me change my mind.  

He then pauses for a moment, stammers ""I'm having a heart attack!"" and hangs up.

Uh oh.  I immediately tell my supervisor.  My supervisor tells me to call 911 and direct emergency services to the customer while he tries to contact the customer.

I call 911 from my workstation, which sets off an alarm in the call center.  Everyone knows I'm on an emergency call.  In less than a minute every supervisor and manager there is crowded around our area and has learned what's going on.  I get the local 911.  I explain what's going on, they patch me in to the 911 in Bakersfield, CA.  I explain the situation and am on the line with their 911 while my supervisor is calling every number on the customer's account to get him.

He tries calling the customer back.  No answer.  He calls the other 4 lines on the account and gets the customers wife and 3 kids. . .and tells them what's going on and that we're trying to see if this man is okay.  His wife says she's leaving work now to go home and check on him.  His kids are all old enough to drive, and they all say they're leaving whatever they're doing to go home and check on their dad.  

Around this time, I get off the line with 911, and my boss is putting the calls he's making on speakerphone for everyone around to hear.

He gets to the last number on the account.  The landline.  This is usually vestigial, most landline numbers on accounts were obviously out of use, but he was checking to be sure.  He calls the number. . . .

. . .the customer picks up on the other end.  My boss introduces himself, the customer goes ballistic saying he didn't want to talk to us.  Apparently he refused to pick up when called back because he said he was too angry at us to talk to us.  Well, my boss let him know we'd called 911 because he'd reported to us he was having a heart attack.   The guy said that he wasn't having a heart attack, he was just saying that to make it clear how much we were upsetting him by not taking those ""phony"" charges off the bill.  

At about this moment you can hear a siren in the background and the customer is asking what's going on.  There's a pounding on the customer's door that can be heard over the phone.

My boss explains that we've contacted 911 since he reported he was having a medical emergency and we couldn't reach him.  There's louder pounding on the customers door and we can hear some shouting in the distance.  

The customer goes ballistic, saying that if he has to pay anything for this ambulance call, he'll sue us, he shouts about how he'll have us all fired, he'll sue our company and us personally, and how when it's over he'll own our whole company and have us all thrown in jail. . .and then he hangs up.

Needless to say, we never heard another word from the guy or about this incident.",1649,1,0

First strongly worded email sent to company about me.,"Tl;dr Karen wanted a free day of an more expensive bounce house and I had to say Nah-Half price and she told me I was ruining kids birthday and had no heart during a pandemic .


I actually had a choosing beggar moment today when I answered a call for the party company I work for.

 Karen is having a birthday party next month for her kids and family/friends. Karen is being a responsible Karen and is splitting the party into two days. Saturday and Sunday. Karen wants to rent an inflatable bounce house with a water slide for a day. I quote the price and inform her of the conditions. Only guaranteed for 7hrs 12pm to 7pm. She said well okay that's doable. But could you not pick it up until after 12pm on Sunday.

Well Karen, I must inform you that becomes a 2 day rental and if you want it to be guaranteed past 7pm on the Saturday, then you'll have to rent for 2 days. I might be able to work out a pricing deal for the 2nd day.

She begins to get upset and double down stating she only needed it until 12pm Sunday. 12 to 12 is 24 hours That's one day. 

I informed her those 24 hours span over 2 days. But we could give her the 2nd day at half price. 

She says that we should just leave it till Sunday it shouldn't be a big deal. She can't afford two days. 

I told her they're not going to leave it for free when they can rent it out again full price. We're not going to block that day off for free. 

She starts trying to manipulate us into making her happy by talking about that other companies do also have our 2 day rental policy but one would give her the extra day free. We should do the same. 

I stayed firm and said ""From what you're telling me, we have the same industry standards as other companies.""

Karen: ""Well you're only the 2nd company I've called and i don't want to keep calling around, so you're not going to guarantee me the Sunday free?""

Me: ""No, I can not. Half price is the best offer.""

Then she wailed about covid quarentine and her invites and why she needs the two days and we're so uncaring. I said ""I'm sorry you feel that way, we've tried to work work you"". Karen said I'm ruining the children's birthday.

She slammed the phone and I got informed of the email that complained I wasn't accommodating and disrespected her and I was rude bc i didn't say ""I'm sorry"" before I said ""No.""

Tale #2: When Boxing Day Comes Early...,"**For backstory, see first tale:** [A Sucky Situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/hohyxd/tale_1_a_sucky_situation/)

**TD/LR at the bottom**

As with most jobs, the holidays bring out the worst in mankind. Callcenters really are no different. Especially for those of us that work the retail side of things. We all know what happens when you stand between a Karen and the money she has on reserve for her ""precious babies' Christmas presents"". And when you work at a job that processes automatic orders of expensive skincare sets, and Hunbots *conveniently* forget to delay the orders of all of their Debbie Downlines, you wind up being at the receiving end of a lot of screaming fits regarding ""the $200 you charged to my card without my permission!""

We have your permission, *DEBBIE.* It's in the fine print you didn't bother to read when you signed up for the account!

In any case, this isn't your classic 'I want a refund!' story. This is something different. Something...special.

It was the second week of December. Being at the first half of the month, with Christmas around the corner, and smack dab in the middle of our auto-processing schedule, it has not been a great day. I've been in verbal conflict with Karens and Suzies and Debbies all morning, and I just want to go to lunch and get away from these loonies for 30 miserable minutes.

With five minutes to go, I heave a sigh of frustration as my phone beeps--a sound that still resonates into my worst nightmares. I am a slave, and a woman's robotic voice cheerfully belts out the name of masters.

It's time, once more, to sell my soul.

**ME:** Thank you for calling Despair and Misery. My name is NomadicSeraph. How can I assist you today?

**KAREN:** Hello, NomadicSeraph. I need some help regarding an order that was recently delivered to a customer of mine.

**ME:** I can certainly assist you with your client's order. May I please have your client's first and last name, and her email address.

**KAREN:** Yes. It's Suzie. Suzie Schmuck. And her email is suzieisasucker @ fake email. com.

**ME:** Ah! Here she is. Let me pull up her order history here...Oh! I see she is a new customer, and this was her first order, correct? For the ""I'm Insecure About My Appearance Please Take $200 From Me"" skincare set?

**KAREN:** That's the one. She called me earlier stating that her package arrived damaged.

**ME:** Oh no! I'm so sorry about that.

**KAREN:** I know. I am, too. I'm wondering if we can send a replacement to her.

**ME:** Oh, absolutely. Were all of the products damaged or just a couple of them?

**KAREN:** Oh. No. All of the products are fine.

I blink. Surely...surely, that's not correct. If the products are all good to go, why do you need a replacement?

**ME:**...Sorry. Did...Did you say the products aren't damaged?

**KAREN:** Yes, the products are fine. But the box came in half crushed.

So, now I'm thinking, 'Okay. Well, it's near Christmas. Maybe it was meant as gift, and the packaging was ruined, they want it to look nice for the receiver. That makes sense, right? That has to be what it is, right?

Just to be certain...

**ME:**...By box, do you mean the product's packaging? Or do you mean the box it was actually shipped in?

**KAREN:** The box it was shipped in. The product is fine.

No. Just...no, that's...that's not...this isn't...that isn't how this works!

**ME:** \*still uncertain\* So...the products, the bottles, the packaging, the pamphlets. All of that is fine? It's just the cardboard box the items were transported in that was damaged?

**KAREN:** Yes. That's correct.

I look up at the ceiling, wondering if I died and this actually is Hell. I just don't know it, yet.

**ME:** Ma'am. I can't replace $200 worth of product just because the shipping box was damaged in transit.

**KAREN:** \*legitimately confused\* What? But why not?!

**ME:** ...Because she has the products she paid for, in the condition they were meant to be in, with nothing broken, creased, or missing.

**KAREN:** Really?! But it's such a bad first impression! It makes the company look bad!

**ME:** I'm sorry if she feels that way. But the condition of the shipping box is not our responsibility. If she has an issue with that, she'll need to take it up with the mail carrier. Not us.

**KAREN:** \*scoffs\* But it's so unprofessional!

**ME:** I agree that receiving a shipping box in poor condition doesn't look great. But again, that's not a reflection of our company, but of the mail carrier.

**KAREN:** So you're not willing to do anything?!

**ME:** Ma'am--

**KAREN:** No! Someone has to do something, or I want a manager!

UHHHHG...Here we we go with *this* shit again.

**ME:** \*wishing my phone would burst into flame\* I understand, ma'am. Let me check in with my supervisor to see what we can do. Is it alright if I place you on hold?

**KAREN:** If it gets you to do something, then sure!

**ME:** Okie dokie. I'll be right back.

I place Karen on hold and dial up good ole Super Awesome Manager (SAM). Honestly, I had already pestered her several times for irate calls that day, so I felt a little bad hitting her up, again.

**SAM:** \*picks up\* Uh oh. What did you get on your line now?

**ME:** Uhg...It's just been one of those days, Sam. Swear it must be a full moon or something.

**SAM:** Tell me about it. What's up?

**ME:** I have a lady on the line. She wants us to send a replacement ""I'm Insecure About My Appearance Please Take $200 From Me"" skincare set.

Pause for effect...

**ME:** ...Because the shipping box was damaged...

Silence. Then...

**SAM:** ...Wait? So the products are damaged?

**ME:** No.

**SAM:** ...Then the product packaging is damaged?

**ME:** ...No

**SAM:** So it's--

**ME:** The cardboard box it's shipped in. Yes.

**SAM:** Are you freaking serious?

**ME:** Unfortunately.

**SAM:** Well...Wow. That's just...wow. That's a new one. Why do you get all the crazies?

**ME:** \*presses face into desk\* *I don't know!*

**SAM:** Well...I guess just call tag it and send out a new one.

**ME:** It won't get there before Christmas. Deadline was two days ago for the free ship options. Not to mention, call tags are $50. We're spending $50 to essentially replace a freaking cardboard box!

**SAM:** It's definitely stupid. But it might get her off your phone. As for the deadline, that's not our problem. She has the product. She can either keep it, or she can risk not having it before Christmas. We are *not* expediting shipping on top of the call tag for something like this.

**ME:** Works for me. I'll relay the info.

**SAM:** Got it. Don't let her get to you.

**ME:** Too late.

I switch back over to Karen.

**ME:** Hello, Karen. Thank you for holding and I apologize for the wait. My supervisor has informed me that we can request that the mail carrier pick up the current package. Then we can send out a new order in hopes that the box is in better condition this time. However we can't guarantee she'll get the new set before Christmas.

**KAREN:** No! That's unacceptable! Why would you pick up the first order? And why can't you expedite the shipping?!

**ME:** Well, we're not going to let her keep $400 worth of product because the cardboard box it was shipped in was damaged ma'am. Since the first set is pristine, we would have to pick up that set and send out a new one. And we only waive expedited shipping in the event that the *products* are damaged. Not the box they came in.

**KAREN:** This is ridiculous! You should at least send her a container of $50 EyeCrack for free to make up for this!

I'm starting to get irritated. It is WAY passed my lunch, and I'm getting hangry AF.

**ME:** Make up for *what*, exactly\*?\* She got the product. On time. In perfectly usable condition. Again, if she has an issue with how the product was shipped, that's something to take up with the service that delivered.

**KAREN:** But the box looks horrible!

**ME:** Ma'am. If the shipping box came in damaged, and the products are fine, then the shipping box *did its job.* What do you think the shipping box is for?

**KAREN:**...So you really can't do anything?

**ME:** No. I'm sorry. The condition of the shipping box is not something we have any control over. She'll need to file a complaint with the carrier. Not with us.

**KAREN:** ...What about your manager? Could she do something?

**ME:** Ma'am. It's a $4 cardboard box. Christmas is just a little over two weeks away. No solution we have is going to get her products to her, before Christmas, except for her to keep the perfectly acceptable product she has. We cannot send her replacement products for products that do not need to be replaced.

**KAREN:** I still don't think this is right!

**ME:** I apologize, Ma'am. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

**KAREN:** No! \*click\*

Call disconnected, I punch out for lunch and slowly remove my headset.

Did I seriously just argue with someone for 45 minutes about a cardboard box? What is my life?

I’m from another GENERATION young lady!,"So I’ve been working at home for a call center for the past few weeks and for the most part it’s been tolerable. The company I do customer service for is a smaller scale MLM/Pyramid Scheme sort of company so there’s a fair amount of angry stay at home moms trying to get refunds, but for the most part it’s just taking order and fixing shipping mistakes. Not the worst job I’ve ever had and it pays great. 

Given that most grievances I get are with totally bs company policies, I am almost never personally attacked. However, my favorite bad call so far was from this lady named Barbara and I had to mute myself to keep her from hearing how I really felt about her.

So Barbara was funny because she got her box and there was nothing wrong with it. Her anger came from the fact that there was some letters missing in her last name on the shipping label. Her mailman had been kinda confused about why that would be and didn’t deliver it right away (I guess he wanted to call her first or something? idk). She was LIVID. I kept my cool right until the end of the call. She’d been blaming other people for the mistake the entire time, having no reason to find fault with me but then we got to the end of the call. 

Barbara: thank you so much for listening to my rant. I’m just so upset [yada yada] it’s not your fault. 

Me: No problem, Barbara!

Barbara: ... wow. I cannot believe you just said that *said in the voice of a woman who’d been shot in the gut*

Me: ...sorry? 

Barbara: I come from another generation young lady (no duh) and I cannot believe you would be so rude!

Me: I... am so sorry about that, Barbara (I mean I was kinda sorry I hadn’t hung up earlier so not technically a lie)

Barbara: you aren’t sorry. I know you aren’t. And you really outta think before you speak because... 

And the monologue ensued. She went right for me and told me I was bad at my job, didn’t care about her, and was overall unhelpful. Completely ridiculous 180 jump as I actually hadn’t done anything at all. 

At this point I’m laughing with my hand on the mute button. She hung up on me after she noticed I wasn’t really responding too much anymore. She said she was reporting me or something for being rude, so I texted my supervisor just to make sure he’d listen to the call and verify I did nothing wrong just in case (really can’t afford to lose my job, so best be safe). 

Oddly enough, it was listening to that call that made my supervisor decide I was good enough at my job to warrant an award that month and I got a free amazon gift card. So, thanks Barbara!

Stop lying to me!,"Me: intro, account verification

Angry Lady: I’ve been trying to get a hold of [supervisor name] for WEEKS [*I checked the account notes, she’d first called in 4 days prior*] and she’s *ALLEGEDLY* never available when I call! I’m going to ask you to transfer me to her right now, and I don’t know what I’m going to do if you say she’s not available.

- Sure enough, the sup she’s asking for is currently on a call. At the time, we had been really busy and were massively understaffed, so sups were having to take calls most of the day. And since it was about 9pm at night, there was no other supervisor on.

Me: I’m very sorry, but [sup] is currently on a call. But I’m happy to see if there’s something I can help you with!

AL: No, no, no. Every time I call in, you people don’t understand what the problem is. [sup] is the only one who can help me.

Me: Okay, well I’m not sure how long her current call will take, but I can ask her to call you back either tonight once she’s done, or tomorrow. 

AL: NO. I need to speak to her RIGHT NOW. I’m working tomorrow, and I’m going to bed soon. When will she be done with the call?

Me: [*bitch, how would I know?*] I’m sorry, but I’m not sure. 

AL: *dramatic sigh* You know, I’m starting to believe that all of the people I talk to are lying to me, and [sup] isn’t actually on the phone. She just doesn’t want to talk to me.

Me: No, I can assure you that’s not the case. I can see that she’s on a call right now. We’ve been very busy lately-

AL: I don’t care how busy you are! She needs to speak with me!

Me: And as I said, depending on how long her current call takes, she may be able to give you a call back tonight. Otherwise, I can ask her or another supervisor to call you tomorrow.

AL: I have to speak with [sup]! I don’t want to talk to anyone else! She’s familiar with what’s going on with my account!

Me: I understand. What time would be best for her to give you a call back?

AL: You’re not listening to me! I need to talk to her now! I won’t be able to talk to her later tonight or tomorrow! 

Me: Ma’am, I’m sorry, but she isn’t available to speak with you right this minute.

AL: YOU’RE LYING! Don’t lie to me! I know she’s there sitting next to you, laughing because she doesn’t want to talk to me!

- I was working from home, so this was incorrect.

Me: No, she isn’t. She’s just on a call.

AL: I’m going to ask you one more time, and you better not lie to me. Is. [Sup]. Available.

Me: No, she’s on the phone.

AL: I’ve had it! I’m done with you people and your lies! How can she always be on the phone, every time I call? How is that possible?!

Me: Well, this is a call center, ma’am.

"""No, I'm not going to do that.""","I work for a grocery chain in the US. I deal with online orders that go wrong; delivery not made, items missing, overcharging, etc. I also deal with some light tech issues; mostly just directing a customer to one of our sites to get technical information from them about how they are using our site (browser, OS, etc...)

Names have been changed to protect the aggravating.

Me: Thank you for calling \[REDACTED\]. My name is Nilmandir. How can I help?

Bill: Yeah (insert common nickname for my actual name\*), I'm calling because I can't see my receipt on your website. I'm looking at my order, but I don't see the receipt.

Me: Sorry to hear that sir. Let me get some information from you so I can see how I can help out.

Verifies customer's account. Ask a few broad questions (how long has this been going on, can you see your other orders, are you seeing an error message).

Keep note, the CX has been stating that he needs to see the receipt to confirm what has been delivered. I can't see the actual receipt because it hasn't been loaded into our servers yet (stupid time delays for no reason), otherwise I could confirm. I can see the order, but that is sometimes unreliable because it may contain items that the CX has added or that were not available and were substituted without CX approval. We use 3rd party shopping/delivery service and boy are they fuck ups.

Me: So it looks like I'm going to need to get this reported to the IT team and see if they can figure out what's happening. If you can, I'd like you to go to a special website so I can get some information.

Bill: Sorry? You want me to do what?

Me: Sir, I need to collect some information from you from one of our websites. It will help our IT team determine what is causing you to not see your receipt.

Bill: No. I'm not going to do that.

Me: *utterly flabbergasted* I'm sorry sir...

Bill: Nope, I'm not going to go through all of that. Have a good day. *click*

I sat there and laughed. He spends 10 minutes telling me, repeatedly, that he needs to see the receipt and want to know why he can't, and then doesn't want to do anything to resolve.

Are you a human?,"This is a short and sweet story of when I worked in live chat for a telco. (Edit, ok, so it wasn’t as short as I thought it would be)

For backstory/context: a lot of mobile plans woth this company have or had bonus add ons/bolt ons/credits/VAS on their service. The most significant one, and the one relevant to this story was bonus data bolt ons and monthly credit offers

When contracts end or when offers end, these things get begin to get taken off with an order confirmation email. 

The problem that we’ve found from the customers’ perspective is that the email is a run of the mill automated email with generic wording – it has no indication of what these orders were specifically. They all would say “thanks for your order, this is your order number yada yada” so majority of the chats were customers concerned about potential unauthorised activity since they had no idea what these emails were actually about so we would investigate for them and let them know. It was always 50/50 with how these chats went. It’s either a quick touch and go education piece or it’s a cause for complaint (especially if there was a loss of a discount credit or data, etc). For me personally, I feel like it’s the company stitching themselves up by not customising the automated email to what the order type was.

Getting to the point of the particular chat in question, the customer, like the others, have to pass through a bot so the system knows what department to send someone to. This customer’s original paragraph was quite sternly worded and I just had all the signs of a painful chat. The meaningful connection score for this chat was already sitting at -70 (lowest possible was -100) as the customers ease of experience with the bot factors heavily into this score. I was on edge, feeling like I had to prepare for an attack.

I’m able to greet and authenticate without issue. I had a look on their account and I saw that they had severe internet technical issues a few months ago, so at the time, tech support bolted on some free bonus mobile/cellular data for 3 months, since cellular data is so much more reliable in Australia than fixed broadband). The order confirmation was 3 months to the day of the removal of this bonus data, as it had expired in the system.

I explained what it was and it seems like it flipped a switch in the customer’s mind. They thanked me, said happy that was what it was rather than something sinister. Then they say: “Thanks for confirming that, I’m satisfied with this information as it addressed my concern!” 

It felt like they were typing into an NPS survey and not to me. I start the closing spiel about how I was happy to help and did you need any further help today yada yada. They said no thanks, but then says: “Are you a human, thebiggestyikesever?” 

It felt like lighthearted banter (but when it’s a customer service chat, you never truly know), so I had a risky response by saying:

I feel pretty human I think (I’m in a -my city- based team) since the company has a notorious reputation for poor customer care/call centre experience with the off shore teams, with people thinking that “they are bots”. Not sure what’s like with the BPOs, but the on shore team, like the team I was in, was strongly encouraged not do scripted responses and say exactly we need to say to communicate what needs to be communicated.

I was kind of stressing about how this customer was going to respond to my banter, but they said: thank you so much for being so efficient in your response, you’re a star and I could never say that about a robot. Hope you have a good day, thebiggestyikesever from -my city- and thank you again.”

They proceeded to give me all 10s and named me personally in the nps survey.

Tale #1: A Sucky Situation,"**See TD/LR at the bottom**

**BACKSTORY**

Not so long ago, I worked in living Hell. I wish I could say this was an exaggeration, but that would be lie.

I worked as a customer representative in a tiny, backwater call center that screened calls collectively for multiple ""businesses."" I say ""businesses"" because the majority of them were actually MLMs. Often times, when I mentioned in passing that I was employed at this facility, it was greeted with laughter and/or sympathy.

The business I was selected to take calls for was an MLM that sold shitty, overpriced skincare products.  The majority of which were purchased via an account that would ship product automatically after a number of days.

My job, in short, was to interact with MLM Karens on a day-to-day basis and assist them with placing orders for their customers and downlines. And by 'assist them with placing orders for their customers and downlines' I mean, get screamed at regularly to refund orders that were shipped out automatically because people apparently didn't know how to delay an account--an action that literally required they log into the account and hit...I dunno. Two? Three buttons? It was easy, is what I remember. And you could do it as many times as you wanted.

In any case, I have many stories. If you like this one, I'll post more.

**THE ACTUAL STORY**

So it's a typical weekday in Hell. The calls have been, for the most part, uneventful. It's the second half of the month, meaning our automated system won't be processing orders again until the first. For the next 10 days or so, I can be certain I will have no irate calls beginning with the words, ""YOU PROCESSED AN ORDER, AND I NEED IT REFUNDED! NOW!""

Yes. Life is easier during the second half of the month...

Or...it should be.

A tone plays in my ear. An effeminate electronic voice speaks the name of my company--a reminder and a warning: You are in Hell. Here, there be demons.

ME: Thank you for calling Despair and Misery. My name is NomadicSeraph. How can I assist you today?

KAREN: Hello! Yes. I would like to place an order!

ME: I can certainly assist you with placing an order today. May I please have your name and email address?

KAREN: Yes. My name is Karen McKaren. And my email is iamadramaqueen @ fake emails. com.

ME: Thank you. One moment while pull up your account...Okay. And what is your city and state?

KAREN: \*REDACTED\*

ME: Thank you. There you are. I have your cart pulled up. What would you like to order today?

KAREN: I would like one 'Suck'o'matic Combo Package' with the 'I Can't Believe I'm so Vain I'm Dropping $200 on This Shit' skincare set. My consultant said the package was $450.

Now, I should mention, the Suck'o'matic 3000 (fake name obviously) was--and this is legit--a *skin vacuum*. This was an electronic device designed to suck your skin into a textured, metal end piece, and the end piece would ""exfoliate your skin"" and ""scrape off the dead skin cells"".

I've seen this for the purpose of removing pimples. Which makes sense. You're applying suction to a single, concentrated point. But this was not that. You were supposed to run this thing ALL over your face. And then you had to clean your dead skin out of the vacuum. Which...GROSS.

This personally never sounded like a good idea to me. Honestly, half of what they came up with seemed insane. Just a vain woman's desperate bid at youth eternal. But this item was $300 alone, broke CONSTANTLY, and, used incorrectly, could cause some good bruising and broken capillaries. Can't tell you how many calls I received regarding various issues with the blasted things.

Someone higher up must have thought it was dumb and impractical, too, because the company decided to discontinue the product about a month before this call. Hence, my incoming problem.

ME: I'm so sorry, Karen. The Suck'o'Matic 3000 is no longer available for purchase. If you're looking for an exfoliating product, I can recommend the 'Needle Pokey FaceRoller'.

KAREN:...What do you mean it's not available? When are you getting more in stock?!

Uh-oh...Please don't let her be one of THOSE customers.

ME: I'm sorry. Unfortunately we will not be getting anymore of the Suck'o'Matics in stock. It has been discontinued.

KAREN: Discontinued?! No! My consultant says I NEED to get this item!

...Yep...She's one of THOSE customers.

ME: \*banging the heel of my hand into my head\* I apologize, Karen. But I simply don't have a way to put in an order for that item. It's been removed from the website, and all shipment of that item has been halted.

KAREN: No! You have to have some left! Surely there's stock in the warehouse!

ME: Even if there was, there is no way for me to place an order for it. It's not in our system.

KAREN: This is ridiculous! I happen to know that is a popular item, and there is no way your company would have discontinued it!

ME: I'm sorry. But it *has* been discontinued.

KAREN: You need to make this right! I need that product! If you can't get it for me, I want a manager!

ME: \*sighing internally and rolling my eyes\* Let me check with my supervisor and see if we can figure something out.

I place Karen on hold and pop over to my manager's line.

SAM (Super Awesome Manager): Hey. What's up?

ME: \*sigh\* Hey Sam. I've got a lady on my line that's starting to freak out because she wants a Suck'o'matic. I've told her we don't have them anymore, and she's demanding a manager if I can't place an order. Do you have ANY idea what we can do for her or if there's any way to get her one?

SAM: Oh! Well, actually, while we DON'T have any new ones for sale, we do have refurbished options still available. They're cheaper, but we can't bundle them and supply is limited.  There's a way to place an order on the back end. Hold on. I'll swing by and show you.

ME: Thanks. You're a life saver.

Sam stops by my cubicle and shows me how to place an order for the refurbished item, and I pull Karen back on the line.

ME: Hey there, Karen. Thank you so much for holding, and I'm so sorry about the wait. So, my supervisor has let me know that while we do not have *new* Suck'o'matics available, we do have a limited supply of refurbished units that we--

KAREN: What do you mean refurbished?

ME: ...Essentially, these were units that were returned to us. Either because the item required repairs, or because customers were not satisfied with the product and returned it.

KAREN: EW! I don't want to use something on my skin that someone else has used!

ME:...I assure you that the units have been fitted with new heads and have been thoroughly cleaned. That's why they're refurbished.

KAREN: You don't know that! Don't you know how unsanitary that is! I could get a disease! Ringworm! Bacteria! Disgusting!

ME: I'm certain the refurbished unit would be as clean and functional as a new unit. The units come with extra heads as they do wear down over time. It would be a matter of seconds to change them out.

KAREN: No! I want a new unit. I want the 'Suck'o'matic Combo Package' for $450!

ME: We don't have that. It's not in our system.

KAREN: \*growing hysterical\* I promised my consultant I would buy it! I promised her! You're making me break my promise!

ME: I'm sorry. There's nothing I can--

KAREN: What about your supervisor?! Can't *she* do anything?!

ME: I can get the supervisor, but she's going to tell you the same thing, Karen. All we have are refurbished Suck'o'matics.

KAREN: \*starting to cry\* I can't believe you won't help me! My consultant is going to be so disappointed! I'M disappointed!

ME: I'm sorry. I don't have any other op--

KAREN: \*still crying\* This is HORRIBLE customer service! *I want your supervisor!!*

And THERE it is.

ME: Okay. I will get you my supervisor. I'm going to place you on a brief hold, okay?

KAREN: \*choked up\* Unbelievable.

I page my supervisor again.

SAM: Uh...What's up now?

ME: \*sigh\* She doesn't want the refurbished Suck'o'matic. Wants a new one. And since I can't do anything about that, she wants to speak to you.

SAM: ...Because apparently *I'm* the authority on what we do and don't sell?

ME: Well...ya are now, I guess.

SAM: \*chuckles\* Alright. Send her through.

ME: Good luck.

I transfer the call and disconnect from the line. Then I sit in silence, staring at my computer, wondering what my life has become.

ME:...Did I seriously just have a woman cry over a $300 skin vacuum?

Fred: Okay but I am wanting to know why this didn't move yesterday. This is a small piece, it does not weigh a lot and it needs to move as soon as possible.

Me: Well, Fred it was not able to move yesterday as there was not any space on the aircraft. But it is moving this morning. You will see that as soon as the flight finalizes.

Fred: Yes. But I do not understand why it is not already moving. Just because I did not spend the extra money to move at a higher priority,
my package is going to set there like a **PILE OF SHIT** while others move above it!!!

*Me, internally: LMAO. Bro. It is 7:00 in the morning-how are you already this upset?*

Me: Unfortunately, with the service you purchased we are not able to guarantee it moving on a specific flight. It will only move as space allows. Yes, higher priority service will move faster as we are able to guarantee a due date on it.

Fred: This is just ridiculous. Why is it I have to spend more money just to get what I want??!

"Sir, I do not fix cellphones","This is from a few weeks ago, but... I work at a call center for an ISP, I take care of cellphone services when people want to cancel them, lower their contact's price, more data, etc. One day, a client calls from a store.

Me: good afternoon, my name is..., how can I help you?

Client: I bought a cellphone from one of your stores a while ago, it cost me 1100 something euros...

Me: Okay...

Client: And it broke, and won't work, so I came to the store to get it fixed, and they're charging 8€ and some cents  for the repairs and rental of a phone that I can use while it's in repairs. I don't agree with that price, that's not what's in the contract, so I want to cancel my service.

One thing to note: cellphone contracts have little to nothing to do with repairs, even if created when you purchase a phone. I put him on hold, check his sheet, he has a special offer on his contract, meaning I can't try to placate him with something cheaper, and I obviously can't do anything about the repair fees. He also has a binding period active that only ends next year, meaning of he cancels his contract, he'll have to pay over 100€ in penalty. I get back to the call.

Me: Sir, you currently have a binding period un-

Client: I don't care, I'll pay what I owe, but I want to give up on this.

Me: But sir, then why not pay the repairs...

Client: It's not right, I shouldn't have to pay for it, they're not even lending me the same phone model. It'd be one thing if it was, but it's not!

Me: But sir, repair fees have nothing to do with my department, I can't do anything about it.

Client: so you're losing a customer over 8€? Come on now!

Me: I mean, you're asking me to do something I can't do. At most you could try calling tech support, see if they can do anything, but...

Client: Oh, so you're just trying to pass me off. Whatever, cancel my service.

Me: Alright. Do you want to deactivate your number completely, or are you porting to another company.

Client: That doesn't matter to me.

Me: ... But it matters here, because the procedure on each outcome is very different.

Client: See, see, you're about to tell me to pay the 8€ anyway, whatever, it's over, it's all cancelled right?

Me: Not yet, because-

Client: Because what, I asked to cancel it and you're not cancelling, what, why, what is this-

Me: &lt;raising my voice by now so he won't interrupt me&gt; Sir, when you want to port the number to a different company, the contract is cancelled after you contact them and ask for the transfer, so it's taken care of between the two companies.

Client: &lt;sounding almost amused&gt; Woow, OK, ok, I get it!

Me: Anything else?

Client: No that's it.

"We can only honor our prices and policies, sorry.","Had a customer try to get a refund on the delivery fee. I honestly had a good laugh with how calmly angry he was.  


Guy: Yeah, I was charged for delivery, but I qualified for free delivery. Please refund me the delivery fee.  


Me: I'll be happy to look into this. Ah, I see why you were charged. Your order did not meet the minimum for free delivery. Free delivery is for orders $50 or more. Your order was shy about $6.  


Guy: But I always get free delivery.  


Me: Your last two orders were over $50. So yes, you did get free delivery on those. But the orders under have delivery fees.

Guy: Well, that's just not good business. ""OTHER BUSINESS"" always gives me free delivery. I just thought you did, too. Don't you match with competitors?  


Me: No, we do not. We only honor the sales and coupons we offer. We send them by email and post them online.  


Guy: Look, I'm not trying to be a hard-ass, I'm just saying.  That's just not right. ""OTHER BUSINESS"" gives free delivery on orders $40.  You should honor that. You'll have more business honoring that.  


Me: I'll gladly send your feedback to my manager for review. If our minimum for free delivery changes, we'll be sure to update it online.  


Guy:  So are you going to give me free delivery?  


Me: For orders $50 or more, sure!  


Guy: But not this order...I don't see the difference in $10, but fine. Keep it. Have a good day.

Old Lady Rages Over Being Told Yes,"So I was working for a long term care insurance agency a while back. My job was totally remote/work from home and being able to do my job in pjs was great. But, like most call centers it had its issues. 

This one day this lady calls in about needing to pay her premium. For some god only knows reason this particular company refused to take payments online or over the phone. You could either sign up for direct bank draft, or you could mail a physical check. That was it. Completely stupid in the 21st century, but whatever. It was what it was. 

So anyway, this lady calls in and asks if she can mail in two checks for her single premium. 

M- me
L- Lady

M- Hi, thank you for calling “company”, my name is..., may I have your info please? 

L - yes, my name is... my number is... 

M- Wonderful, how can I help you today?

L- yes, I need to pay my premium but I need to send two checks from two different accounts. I can do that and send it to “address”, right? 

M- you absolutely can send two checks but to do so you need to send them to “alternate address” instead. 

L- why won’t you let me send them? I just need to send two checks instead of one. 

M- yes, ma’am. But at “address” the intake is completely automated. If there are two checks in the envelope the machine will only pull the first one and shred the second. But if you send it to “alternate address” the intake is done by a real person and both checks will be posted to your account. 

L- I just want to send two checks! Why won’t you let me send two checks? (At this point she starts yelling). 

M- ma’am, of course you can send two checks. You just need to send it to “alternate address”. 

L- I cannot believe that you are refusing to let me send in two checks! I need to pay my premium! Why are you not letting me do this?! 

This went on for over 10 minutes with me trying to calmly explain that yes, she could absolutely send in two checks, just not to the address she had. She yelled at me some more, told me I was a horrible person for ruining her day, and finally hung up on me in a fit. I sat there after the call for a good 5-7 minutes just trying to figure out what the heck had just happened while I tried to stop shaking (I don’t take being yelled at well). 

It was one of the strangest calls I had while working there. I put notes in her file that I was concerned for her mental state as she was an elderly customer (as most of my customers were). I also reached out to my manager to see if there was someway to alert the customer’s family that she was showing signs of mental instability but was basically told there was nothing we could do directly and to just document it in the notes. 

It was the only time I remember being yelled at for telling someone, “yes”.",735,0,0
To the Angry Hotel Manager,"I work in sales support for an insurance company, mostly dealing in travel. So, many third parties websites will promote us and have phone numbers to get into contact with us if that person needs to. Since the phone number is for a website selling multiple different companies, many times people will not direct themselves correctly, which is fine and most people understand, until this lady. 

So she calls in and states that they have a customer trying to check in,but something with the credit card wasn’t working so she was calling us (a travel insurance company to help). I had her reexplain the problem again because I had no idea what she was talking about. I reiterated that this is a travel insurance company  and I can’t help because I don’t know what your talking about.  

She starts flipping out and called me “incompetent” ,told me this was “fucking ridiculous”. 

I told her “sorry that you called the wrong number but there is nothing that I can do because we don’t perform those functions”

She ends the call with “fuck this company”

This a summarized version of the call. I went back and forth with her how we are an insurance company and I have no idea what you are talking about. I looked up the people names in our system and nothing showed up either. So to the angry hotel front desk clerk, fuck you too.",44,0,0
Who raised these people?? [rant],"Hiya, I work for a company that does home improvement, and my main duties are to make outbound calls to folks who sign up online to schedule an estimate, and take inbound calls. 

People constantly get mad at me for calling them despite they literally requested it. 
Like, My shift starts at 8am and people will pick up the phone and scream at me for calling too early. Like send me to VM???? Thanks Karen i really wanted to start my day by getting screamed at 

Or the guy who called the WRONG department to confirm an appointment he had with service. I let him know that I can send an email to service and have them reach out to confirm, then he calls me “useless” and makes a bunch of condescending comments about how I’m making this sooOOOoooOO confusing. 
Call the SERVICE department for service, and not the scheduling department for first time customers. 

^that goes hand in hand with the people who don’t want to wait on hold for service so they call me, and when I advise all I can do is transfer them to service they become irate. No amount of being insufferable will magically make me capable of assisting you when you’re blatantly calling the wrong department. 

All of the people who hang up on me when I’m right in the middle of a sentence? Cool now I have to call you back. Use your words like an adult and you can either get what you literally signed up for or removed from the calling list. 

I asked a guy to let me know when he’s available, so I can offer appointments that fit with his schedule, so he told me I was unbelievably rude and hung up on me ???",21,0,0

the time I rage quit after 1 month on the job,"Hello All, I don't post much on the sub, but I have a story to tell you. I'm not quite sure what made me think about this, but I hope you enjoy it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background info: I was working in a call center that was an outsourcer for a major US bank... let's call them Farther Good. I was in the mortgage division. And now on with the story :)

&amp;#x200B;

TL/DR: a customer rages because of account security, QA gives me no support, and tries to threaten me. I rage quit in the middle of the call.

&amp;#x200B;

The cast of characters:

&amp;#x200B;

Me- All but dead inside

&amp;#x200B;

QA- They listened live on calls to supposedly help you out, but really it was to berate you

&amp;#x200B;

customer- The person that put me over the edge.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*Beep\*** Me- (insert standard greeting) How may I help you today?

&amp;#x200B;

Customer- Yeah, I want to pay off my mortgage, can you give me the pay off quote?

&amp;#x200B;

Me- Of course, but before we go any further I need to verify a few things before we continue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Customer- No, you don't need any of that to give me the pay off quote. Just give me the damn quote NOW!

&amp;#x200B;

Me- I'm sorry, but in order to see any of your information, the system requires me to get some security verification. If you are unable or are worried about providing this information you may go to a branch and they can assist you. 

&amp;#x200B;

Customer- Your shitty bank bought my loan, the nearest branch is 100 MI away. Do you really expect me to drive all that way just to do YOUR job?

&amp;#x200B;

Me- Again, I'm sorry but this out of my control.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*beep beep\*** Me- Can you please hold while I see if there is something that I can do?

&amp;#x200B;

Customer- Ugh, fine! \*put's customer on hold\*

&amp;#x200B;

**QA gets on the line with me:**

&amp;#x200B;

QA- So, you need to deescalate this customer, you are going to fail your QA and then we won't give you your bonus. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me- Care to give me any tips on how to do that?

&amp;#x200B;

QA- That's not our job, just figure it out.

&amp;#x200B;

**deep breath** gets back on the line with Customer:

&amp;#x200B;

Me- I'm sorry about that hold, I did look into this situation and unfortunately, there is no alternative way to access your account. I am more then willing to ask the minimal amount of information needed if it makes you more comfortable?

&amp;#x200B;

Customer- You really are bad at your job, you understand that, right? Isn't it that the customer is always right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Me- **\*under my breath\*** not in banking. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me- The reason we need to verify your account is so that we don't give out this information to someone trying to steal your identity, or steal your house. 

&amp;#x200B;

Customer- FINE. But I expect some kind of credit for having to be so inconvenienced. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me- Thank you for allowing me to verify your identity, and we will definitely discuss giving you a credit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me- It looks like your pay off quote is XXXX.XX. Would you like me to tell you the ways that you could send that in?

&amp;#x200B;

Customer- HOW THE HELL IS IT THAT MUCH! I HAD A 30 YEAR MORTGAGE AND I HAVE PAID FOR 20 YEARS!

&amp;#x200B;

Me- Well Customer, it looks like you had a high-interest rate when you started the mortgage and never refinanced. Also, looking at your recent account history you missed payments often, which incurred penalties. 

&amp;#x200B;

Customer- Well I won't pay that. the most I will pay is XXX.XX! And that's final! What are you gonna do if I stop paying after that amount? 

&amp;#x200B;

Me- **\*totally losing it on this person\*** The bank will foreclose and repossess your home. We will then all laugh and cheer as you are thrown out in the streets.

&amp;#x200B;

**Before anyone says anything in the comments, I know this is cold and heartless, but remember I was dead inside at the time and really didn't care.**

&amp;#x200B;

**\*Beep beep\*** Me- Customer, can I place you on another hold, I need to confer with a higher up representative about the next steps here.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*I don't wait for an answer and just place them on hold\***

&amp;#x200B;

QA- ARE YOU SERIOUS WITH HOW YOU ARE TREATING OUR CUSTOMER! YOU JUST LOST YOUR BONUS!

&amp;#x200B;

Me- You don't pay me enough to deal with someone berating me. I'm sick of having no support.

&amp;#x200B;

After that interaction, I took off my headset, grabbed my things, and got up from my desk. I walked to the front door, and just as I was passing the front threshold dropped my badge on the ground. I was seriously done with that place. I still wonder what happened once I left, did anyone realize that I had left a customer on hold? I never got contacted by the outsourcer to see what happened to me, so I guess they either understood or just didn't care. It was after this experience that I decided to finally leave call center life and got a job in IT. But those stories are for a different sub.

I Want It Free and I’m Not Extending My Contract!!,"I was reminded of this interaction from another story on here. This took place right after the original Motorola Razr stood the cellular world on it’s head! Sorry for the length... 

I worked in a call center for a rather large (at the time) cellular carrier that took calls from the Massachusetts - New York State areas around 2003 - 2005. This carrier had bought out several smaller carriers and integrated their customers over, they allowed many of them to keep their current plans and “Grandfathered” them into our systems. These plans were obsolete and once changed or cancelled could not be reinstated. Also, many of the newer phones, with newer technology were completely incompatible with these old plans. There was actually very little we could do with these accounts unless the customer was willing to upgrade to a newer plan. 

I was on the Retentions Team Department and was able to offer much better deals and plan adjustments than other representatives to keep customers from cancelling their services. 

I receive a call from another representative stating that this is a Retentions Team escalation call. This man was already LIVID because he was informed that he would not be able to upgrade to a new phone without upgrading his current plan. I look into the account and see that he was on one of the very oldest “grandfathered” plans. He had been a customer for over a decade (remember, this is around 2004)! He still had his original phone! He had never upgraded or changed a single thing on this account in all the time he had been a customer! He never had so much as a late payment or any issues of any kind! I was amazed at how little was on the notes of this account considering it’s age! I was determined to keep this customer and make him happy! 

When I took the call and had him verified, I asked why he wished to cancel his service with us after so long. He told me that after so many years, his phone finally broke and he needed a new one, but was told he would have to upgrade his original plan and he didn’t want to do that. I apologized profusely for the inconvenience and began explaining why he would have to upgrade his plan. I told him that I could offer him a similar plan for just a few more dollars a month AND I could place a permanent credit which would bring the plan to the same amount he was currently paying! He was satisfied with that offer. Now to the issue of the broken phone. He wanted a free phone for being such a long time customer. I actually had a list of 5 or 6 phones (these phones being a year or two on the market) which I could actually offer him at no charge, with a 2 year commitment. He immediately went off on a screaming tirade that he would most certainly NOT be signing a 2 year contract with anybody for any reason!! I explained that the only way to get a discounted or free phone requires a new contract and that if he did not wish to sign a contract, he would have to pay full retail price for the phone. He then informs me that I WOULD be sending him a Motorola Razr phone for free and I WOULD be adding that free phone to his current cellular plan! I explained to him that I would not and COULD NOT be doing as he demanded! I explained that his current plan is not compatible with the newer technology phones and he would not even be able to connect to the towers without a compatible plan! I also explained that as it is our newest and most popular phone at the moment, I could not offer that phone at no charge for anyone! I could offer a significantly lower price than advertised, but not free. Upon hearing this, he demands to speak with my manager! I ask him to hold and go to my manager. I have my manager pull the account up then explain the customers demands. After laughing for a couple minutes, he tells me to transfer the customer over to him. I was on the phone with this customer for almost 30 minutes, my manager was on with him at least that long. 

The end result was he upgraded the plan with the credit I offered, accepted one of the phones I offered him at no charge WITH a new 2 year commitment! Guess his manager escalation was well worth his time after all!!",50,0,0
"4 months in, this is my story.","I work in a cell center for car insurance and have been there 4 months. Almost everyone hired at the same time as me is gone. I am not sure why? 

It's not high pressure, there is absolutely no cold-calling, the work environment is great, all my mangers/supervisors are nice, and I get benefits working part time I have never received working elsewhere, such as company matching 401k. The pay is not bad either. 

As far as callers, I get maybe 1-2 angry/rude people a day. I realize they are mad at the company and not me, personally. I've only a couple calls where I was visibly shaking from dealing with someone's anger, but I also speak in a very clear, well spoken and ""authoritative"" voice which seems to make people drop their BS. 

Anyway, I've noticed some odd trends working in a call center. I've started lumping these people into groups and giving them names. 1st off is the ""sexist"". I often receive calls from the girlfriend or wife of the insured, who repeats info to the wife or girlfriend, who repeats it back to me. I honestly have no clue why males will make their significant others talk on the phone for them. As an engaged male myself, it makes absolutely baffles me why they would do this. They don't sound shy, have a speech impediment, or anything else that would prevent them from speaking. 

The second group of people are the fast talkers. I note these mainly come from Florida. I'm starting to think Florida just straight up puts drugs in their water, because most people I talk to in Florida sound like they just did a line of coke before calling in. Again, it slows down the call because I have to have them stop and repeat themselves. I am a very good listener and can type a letter as soon as I hear it, but even then they talk entirely too fast. I've also driven in Florida before and everyone seems to be in a hurry driving as well. So I guess it comes naturally when speaking on the phone as well.

The third group of people are the ramblers. They can be put into two subgroups. The first ones love to ramble on when you ask them a specific question like ""on what date was your car damaged"", and then they have to give some kind of epic speech on the exact details of their travel up to the incident, including what road they were on, the speed, the weather, etc. That's nice and all...but frustrating when you ask something specific like a date and they don't even tell you until the very end of their ""story"". The second group of ramblers piss me off the most, because they will start talking before you even finished your sentence. ""On what date wa.."" ""IS THIS CLAIM GOING TO RAISE MY RATES?"". 

The fourth group is the ""extremely inconvenienced"". These people would complain if you gave them a bar of solid gold and there was a scratch on it. ""I see the closet repair center is 5 miles from you.."" ""FIVE MILES?!?!?! That's too far!"". Or they call in on a Sunday and think a brand new factory windshield for a 2020 Maserati is just laying around in a glass shop and they can be out in 20 minutes to install it. 

The very last group are the ""noise makers"". These piss me off the most. People love to call when they are driving, which is fine. But for the love of god, don't drive with your windows down on the interstate and expect me to be able to hear you, get pissed off when I ask to roll the windows up, or get pissed off when your standing outside in a 50mph wind gust and I have to have you repeat yourself a couple times. 

Other than that, I love my job. It's not very stressful, and most callers are pretty nice and pleasant to talk to.",15,0,0
"I got wrote up during training, which is grounds for immediate termination, because I done what my supervisor told me to do, but it wasn’t what my trainer told me to do.","And apparently, the site director and senior managers agreed with that, because I was in training and wasn’t supposed to listen to anyone else, BUT THEY ALSO say that during training, I’m not to do any account changes for customers without approval from any supervisor, regardless who they are. 

That’s obviously conflicting. There is only one trainer, so the assistance of other supervisors for seasoned agents and tier 2s is necessary. 

But I was in training. Nesting as it’s called in some places. The supervisor should have went and got my trainer, since I’m not allowed to get up and leave a call, instead of approving the changes I was to do. 

When the trainer audited all trainee calls at end of shift, she pulled me over and said I should not have made the changes without her approval. 

Maybe I was in the wrong. Maybe they were. Maybe we both were. 

Good thing though, is that to be terminated in this fashion I have to sign and accept the write up. I didn’t. I just quit.

State restrictions are a pain,"I love state restrictions. They just make life so much more interesting. I love getting yelled at for things outside my control. 

Oh, wait, no. I hate calling states with extra hoops to jump through. I hate getting treated like an asshole because I'm not going to just break federal and state law. Sorry customer, I'm not legally obligated to fuck myself for your convenience. 

This lady calls in, and she is trying to get info about her father's account because she pays the bills. Fair enough, I've seen enough of these. 

However, I'm not legally allowed to disclose any account information because we do not have written permission. So I inform her of this. She begins asking which account pulled up, because she had her own acct. I tell her ""I cannot give you information on an acct you are not the primary on without written permission"". She asks again, same wording. I give her the same wording, because... well, I'm trying to tell her it's her dads without screwing myself. I get the frustration, because I want her to pay me. I don't want this to be difficult. 

I'm also a huge fan of my job. I'm paid quite well, I have health insurance (vision and dental too!), I have generous time off allowances, I can help people, I have no official handle time, I'm working from home, and I have a great management and support team that doesn't leave us hanging even though we're working from home.  I wanna stay here. So if the choice is adhering to legal requirements or being nice to someone, well, legal wins. I'll still try to help, and I'll be apologetic, but I'm not risking my ass. 

From there, she says ""I just want to know what acct pulled up"". I tell her ""ma'am, I would need written permission to disclose the information you're asking for"". I thought about saying ""it's not your account"", but I'm also concerned about releasing information because someone else got fired for doing that recently. 

She then says ""fuck this shit, who cares. I just won't fucking pay"" and click. Which, if the accounts balance wasn't being taken care of by a scheduled pmt already, I might've been concerned. Because I don't want some dude to get fucked because his daughter is to dense to listen to what people are saying and use that information to unfuck herself. 

I just cannot get my head around this logic. Call in to take care of *someone else's card* which *will be reported on their credit card* if you fuck it up.  Flagrant disregard for *actual laws* because... fuck if I know. And then throwing a fit because *someone doesn't want to break said laws*. Like, fucking hell lady.

Random story of gratitude I have today from the most unlikely of calls wanted to spread some positivity! Or I'm too empathetic lol,"I forgot about this today!!!! I got a call from a client who had a snake issue in CT. Unlike other clients, (which is fine) she tried animal control before us. And I had to tell her that unfortunately we dont take care of snakes. 

I told her that normally I would be referring people to animal control and if they couldn't, they could direct them where to turn to. 

She told me that she spotted a snake that was at least 4 foot long in her yard. 

Now, after looking at the notes on her account, I determined she was a pretty low key client, not one to call unless she really felt it to be a true concern and her demeanor was calm, though she kept apologizing for being so upset &lt;3 

She also told me that her and her husband are trying to give it the benefit of the doubt and assume it's a rat snake or such, but die to the length, she believes it's a boa constrictor.  I told her to, and she confirmed, that she did take a picture and I told her it right in the recorded line to look it up online as well, and call them back and give them hell. 

That would just be crazy if it's really a boa!? Good thing I like snakes but even then. 

AMD when I allowed her to apologize for the last time I said, honey, if this you mad (or whatever wording she used for the way she thought she was speaking to me) I said, I would take that every day you're fine dont worry about it. 

I am so grateful for our clients I can be myself with in a job like this. I really do like helping people. So days like today where I got 98% good ones, and friendly, empathetic ones.. jusy one of those makes up for a whole bunch of aholes.",7,0,0
Maybe (Definitely) You’re the Problem,"I got a call about 10 minutes before my break, which didn’t seem like a problem, but I wound up being 22 minutes late because this narcissistic witch kept me on the phone for 32 minutes. So she managed to screw up both my adherence and handle time.

Over the course of 32 minutes, she complained about the man who was supposed to be mailing her payments, how the employees at USPS are rude (with a little racism thrown in, what fun!) to how she struggles with our account number and called repeatedly, would not shut up about how one of my co-workers supposedly purposely gave her the wrong account number (because we don’t want her to pay us?), everyone is so CRUEL and MEAN and unhelpful to her. 

Except for some unnamed male coworker, who she thanked for being male. The sexism is pretty obnoxious, but by this point I’d been through so much whining and all the racism that I already knew she was terrible.

Other highlights include her yelling at me for not seeing something someone from a third party company did, whining about how exhausted she is after calling companies because it takes so much time and stresses her out (because she takes a call that could have been resolved in 2 minutes and makes it last 32 minutes) and endless complaining about the coworker who MALICIOUSLY gave her the wrong account number until I agreed to email a supervisor to pull that call and handle it.

And finally, we went over her account number and balance and I was blessedly able to transfer her to pay the bill. Which was really all she needed to do so this all could have been handled within a couple of minutes, literally.

So perhaps, if everywhere you go, people are not helping you the way you feel like you ought to be helped, if they’re lying or rude everywhere you go and with everyone you speak to, maybe just maybe it’s you?",18,0,0

COVID-19 has really brought out the worst in people.,"Me: “Thank you for calling ****** Bank, this is ImInOverMyHead95, who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?”

CUSTOMER: You people fucked up my account and I want it fixed now!

ME: Currently we’re showing the vehicle is 43 days past due. There’s a total due of...

CUSTOMER: No the account is not past due! I didn’t make any payments because I saw a commercial that said Ford was waiving 3 months of payments due to the ching chong virus, which is a biological weapon because there’s no such thing as a virus that only attacks one organ! So thanks for not honoring that. (I think to myself, *I know who you voted for.*)

ME: That offer was only for people who financed through Ford Credit.

CUSTOMER: I did finance through Ford Credit. I went to a Ford dealership and bought a Ford truck!

ME: No sir you didn’t finance through Ford Credit because your account is financed by ******* Bank. 

CUSTOMER: Well I want three months deferred because that’s what I was promised. The biological weapon was deployed by the ching chong Chinamen to kill us all...

Growing numbness,"Anybody else grow numb during these past few months especially with the covid19 chaos calls.

All i want to do is just get them the help they need, resolve the issue and move on.

Late night Perv,"Hi, this is my first post in this sub, but man, I have a few stories to tell! This one is quite... special... (Hence the NSFW-Tag). For understanding, I am a 25yo woman.

  
I work in a call center for a regional public traffic network in Germany as a side job to my studies at University. My main tasks are answering questions regarding bus and train schedules and booking a so called ""AST"", which is basically a bus/taxi you have to book via telephone if you want to drive to smaller villages when no normal bus is driving anymore. This is especially important for people who work on weekends and until late at night. The job can be quite exhausting, especially when there are problems with the train tracks or the bus drivers are on strike. There are also a lot of entitled people on the phone.

Now, with that out of the way, let's move on to the story:  
It was a Wednesday evening, around 10pm. We were four people in the office and it was rather quiet. There were me, Sarah, John and Fred (those are of course fake names).

John got a call, he answered it and said the usual phrase, but the guy on the phone immediately hung up. We thought nothing of it, stuff like that happens from time to time. Next, Sarah got a call, she answered and hung up seconds later. I asked her what was wrong.

Sarah: ""That guy whispered 'Hello, how are you?' in a tone I absolutely didn't like.""

Her expression was very puzzled, but I could not answer as my phone rang. There was no number on the display, but of course I picked up. A rasping, quiet, male voice answered.

Creepy guy: ""Hey, how are you?""

I paused, my heart pounded. But I decided to screw him over a bit, so I responded:

""Would you like to book an AST?"" 

He seemed to be taken aback by that and said: ""Y... Yeah?""

So, I went through the whole process with him, not saying too much. As the booking was completed, I quickly wished him a good evening and was already with my finger on the button to hang up, as he said:

""Do you know what I am doing right now?""

I said: ""I rather don't wanna know...""

Creepy Guy: ""I'm jerking off right now!""

I hung up, shaking. I was cursing myself. Of course he did and I was stupid enough to give him what he wanted. I quickly tell the others what happened and Fred came over to pat me on the back to calm me down. I was not crying or anything, I was just... baffled.

Seconds later, Sarah got another call, answered and hung up again.

Sarah: ""That was him again! He whispered: 'I wasn't done yet!'"".

He tried two more times after that, but I didn't answer this time. John was the head of the shift that evening and he protocolled everything to give to our supervisors the next day.  
The last time that Creepy Guy tried, Fred answered instead of me and asked him in the most high-pitched voice he could come up with: ""Do you want to book a taxi?"".

The guy didn't call again and we laughed it off, even though deep down I was very uncomfortable. I told my parents about it and they suggested that I go to the police to file for sexual harassment, but I didn't have the number of that guy, he knew exactly what he was doing by calling with his number hidden. Besides, the police would have berated me anyways, that i shouldn't have given him the opportunity to do stuff like that.

Yeah, so that was my experience, I still think back to it from time to time. It just baffles me that people like this exist. I know I should have reacted differently and from now on, I will hang up instantly if they start to talk like that.",18,0,0
Comparing an associate to a serial killer,"This customer had called multiple times regarding this complaint. Basically, she had taken a long time in the fitting room, and the associate had gone to check if she was OK. This turned into the customer saying 'she's accusing me of stealing'.

Her whole tone and attitude on the phone stank of Karen. She had me on the phone for an hour moaning about this, and it was her fourth call. However, this part of the interaction nearly broke my professionalism:

Customer: ... And you know what? I think that associate has a serious mental problem. She's like [serial killer]. I'm a psychiatrist, I know about these things.

I don't want to name the serial killer, as that would make the case identifiable. But this is a prolific serial killer many people know about. This was the first time I spoke beyond showing that I was still listening.

Me: Ma'am, I understand, but it's not really fair to compare someone trying to do their job to a serial killer.

Customer: She has that same sense of entitlement as he did. I'm telling you, its a textbook case of psychopathy. Why are you defending a psychopath?

Me: I can't really comment on whether she is or isn't. All I am saying is that it isn't fair to make such accusations.

Cue another half an hour of this diatribe. My manager, who was listening, sent an email to the whole team warning us all about this woman and telling them all to check my notes. Apparently she got nothing for all her complaining, as the manager in store refused to go near her and she wouldn't accept the digital gift card we offered her.",15,0,0
That one time a customer called me a Fing C and I got her banned from shopping with us.,"Obligatory sorry for mobile, also I use too many words and I'm aware so it's long. 

I take escalations for an online retailer and surprisingly, people are buying a lot of outdoor equipment right now. This particular customer received an item two months ago and wheedled her way into free assembly.

She decided that it was the wrong style and wouldn't work so she called us to demand that we send her the ""right"" one. Not to ask if there were options for a return (there weren't) or to see if we could help her out with a discount to buy the right one. She insisted that we sent the wrong thing and it was our responsibility to ""make it right"".

I pointed out that she had placed the order herself - apparently she just pushed what the agent told her to! Now if this had been more ambiguous I might have looked for the call but the differences in the models are very different.

I told her that we had already done free assembly and that we wouldn't be sending her a free item nor would we take it as a return. She might be able to sell it locally and make the funds back! No no, that wasn't going to work. It ""wasn't fair"" and she needed this item so I should send it!

Now up to this point she had been whiny and pushy, but her voice wasn't loud and she wasn't swearing. The moment I made it clear that I wouldn't be doing what she wanted the flip switched. ""Well you're just a f%@&amp;ing c%#="" and hung up.

Now, this made me laugh but her attitude made me wonder if she had pulled this stuff before. Spoiler alert: she had and she had gotten away with it. Now, I brought this to the attention of our executive team and threw in the fact that she spoke to me like she did. I'm generally extremely good with customers and they know this.

Long story short (too late): we don't want her money. It's not worth the annoyance.",75,0,0
20 cents off looses us a mortgage,"I work front desk at a hotel but also sometimes work the call center side of the hotel so I frequent this subreddit as well as r/talesfromthefrontdesk. This time however I have a question from the customer side of things (if this isn’t allowed on here please let me know).

So my daughter got her first cc last fall. The card is from a store but is actually one of those credit card companies that owns a lot of the store credit cards. This January she thought that she had paid off the balance but accidentally left 20 cents on it. Cue the $36 late fee after the due date. 

They probably sent her an email, but thinking she was all paid off and because she didn’t want to be tempted to buy more stuff she had been deleting all emails from the company without looking at them. When February’s due date came along she got charged a second late fee and at that time they reported her to the credit agencies as 30 days late. 

She then received a voicemail saying that she had an urgent matter on her account so she looked and realized what had happened. She then paid off the late fees and the 20 cents and actually had a zero balance and hadn’t charged anything else on the card.

Well because this was her first card and she had a limited credit history, this 20 cents that she missed that was reported as 1 month 30 days late took her credit score down 86 points. 

She is trying to qualify for a mortgage and this only negative mark on her credit report caused her credit score to go down below what is acceptable for a mortgage. 

So she tried sending a letter explaining what happened, apologizing, owning up to her mistake, and promising that she would be more careful in the future, and requesting that they take the negative mark off her credit report. 

She got a letter back a few weeks later telling her that after review they decided that they cannot remove the late report on her credit report. 

All because of 20 cents.

Does anyone here have a suggestion for her to try? 

It’s horrible to think she will lose out on buying a house over 20 cents.",27,0,0
I cannot send you a new card for a closed account,"So I work at a contact center for a pretty major credit card company. I'll be me and we'll just use C for the caller.

Me: alright ma'am, so upon further inspection it looks like your account was closed in June, which is why you didn't receive a new card. 

C: so are you going to be sending me a new one now?

Me: no ma'am, since your account is no longer open I would not be able to send you a new card. 

C: well why not?

Me: it does look like we mailed you a letter in may to state that we will not be renewing your contract. So I will not be able to send you an updated card

Where do you see yourself in 5 years? 10? 15?,"This is a story of a 70+ year old Karen who I spoke with a couple weeks ago. For context, I work in the retention team for a phone, internet and TV provider. Also relevant to the story is the fact that since COVID happened, I'm working from home and many of my usual business procedures are suspended or very different from usual. I'm sure you all can relate.

Me: ""Thank you for calling AS&amp;S, this is Craptain_Coprolite speaking. Who do I have the pleasure of assisting today?""

Karen: *instant wailing* ""You people stole my money, and are refusing to give it back! Who do I have to talk to to get my money back?""

Me: ""I'm so sorry to hear you're having trouble getting a refund. The good news is, my department has the ability to do pretty much anything any of the other departments can do, so I should be able to help.""

Karen goes on to explain, in her own rambling nonsensical way, that we had somehow managed to set her up with a duplicate TV and Internet account about 6 months ago, and she'd been paying for both of them since and hadn't noticed. Like most customers, she pays absolutely no attention to the bills we send her nor the transactions coming out of her bank account, so it took her half a year to figure out that she had two accounts. Upon further investigation in the notes, I see that the second account was created because she decided to call and order new service because she wanted new customer pricing, but failed to call to disconnect the old account when she did so, so there were about 4 months billed for both account. At this point in the story where I picked up the phone, the duplicate account has already been disconnected, and PER HER REQUEST(I can see this in the notes from about 3 weeks before), the credits of the duplicate (totalling almost $1000)  was transfered into the remaining account, which now had a huge credit balance, meaning she wouldn't owe us a bill for several months.

Karen: ""I don't want you greedy bastards to just eat up that credit with your monthly bills! I want my money NOW!""

Me: ""I can totally understand wanting that balance in the form of a check, what we can do is have a supervisor fill out a form for the refund, and we can send that out to you within 10 business days. Here's the only catch: because I'm working from home, I don't have the proper security clearance to gather the financial information necessary to do that kind of refund (this is way outside our normal business procedures under even normal circumstances). What I will have to do is schedule a time for a supervisor to call you back within 3 days to go through this form with you.""

This didn't sit right with Karen, who insisted that everyone keeps saying that but supervisors never call her back. Looking through the account history, I do see multiple attempted supervisor callbacks in which she didn't answer the phone and they left voicemails, trying to reach her repeatedly throughout the day.

Well, Karen and I ended up going around and around and around on this for 2.5 hours. My department doesn't worry about handle time, but you can imagine how mentally and emotionally exhausting this was. This woman was all over the place, and couldn't keep on track with the conversation. I'd start to answer a question, and before I could get halfway through the sentence she'd cut me off and pivot to something unrelated. 

Karen: ""Where do you see yourself in five years?""

Me, caught off guard: ""I don't really know how to answer that right now... I guess I'd like to own a home?""

Karen: ""What about in ten years?""

Me, exhausted: ""I don't know.""

Karen: ""What about in 15 years?""

Me, annoyed: ""I don't know, Karen.""

Karen: ""Now ask me those same questions""

I probably shouldn't have humored her at this point but I was drained and just wanted the call to end. ""*Sigh* Okay, Karen, where do you want to be in five years?""

Karen, dramatically: ""I want to be alive.""

Me, rolling me eyes: ""And in ten?""

Karen: ""I want to still be alive.""

Me, face-palming: ""And in 15?""

Karen, very dramatically: ""I want to be thanking GOD for every day that I still draw breath. You see, Craptain_Coprolite, I don't have many years left [goes into detail here about health issues I don't care and don't want to hear about] and I want to spend the few years that I have left with my friends and family, not on the phone with your company!!""

At this point I'm incredulous. You see, she created this situation. She opened the duplicate account. She failed to cancel the old account. She didn't look at her bank account for 6 months, and then when we canceled the old account we WOULD have sent her a check, but she requested that the balance be transfered to the new account instead. Every minute spent on the phone with my company was her fault, and her fault alone.

"""They're recording my voice to open credit cards and commit fraud!""","I recently started doing credit card collections for a rather large bank, and for the most part, I love my job. We are given a lot of leeway in helping people, and we have no official handle time, so we can really take the time to find a solution for people's problems. It's fuckin amazing, and I get to work from home so I'm free from the evil that is pants. 

So, I'm doin my thing, and an inbound call comes in. I give my introduction, and it's a transfer call from our Fraud department. That's pretty neat, and the rep explains the CM wanted to go through some statements to see what's going on. Oh, sure, no problem. Account is up, it sounds like a simple ""explain the charges, explain why they should pay while the dispute process is done, boost my numbers"". They transfer the CM in. 

Now, I'm a pretty patient person. I grew up with people who liked to tell long winded stories and repeat themselves and don't stop talking. I can listen and can do a pretty good job of knowing when to interject so I can be heard. 

My years of experience meant nothing in the face of this CM. First, it's start off with her yelling. Everything is yelling. And it doesn't stop. I had to wait 10 minutes to properly verify. She gave me her name, launched into a tirade. Get the mothers maiden name, another tirade. She's yelling about the last 4 of her card. She's yelling about how she had someone helping her and he stole the card and committed fraud. She told me EVERYTHING, and then said so again. I heard this story 10 times, almost verbatim, at 110% volume before I stopped counting. That was the first 20 minutes. 

So, as she's yelling I'm looking through the account. I can't see that far back to go over the charges. I cannot help her on this account. Check back into the CM. ""They're recording my *VOICE* and *USING IT TO COMMIT FRAUD ON ME*"". Alrighty, I don't even know how to field that one. And she somehow got louder for that part, I don't know how. Woman was part howler monkey I guess. 

So, I try to interject, but no. She now is saying ""I can't even go to the *BATHROOM WITHOUT BEING RECORDED"". 

Wat. 

Okay. So now I try to bring her attention to her other card. The one I can help with. And now she's yelling about ""I *NEEEEEED* a *CREDIT CARD*. WHY CAN'T YOU SEND ME ONE"". Try to speak, nope. Back into the loop of fraud, being recorded for fraud, being recorded in the bathroom, needing a credit card. I was hoping she'd tucker herself out, but... no. That wasn't happening. 

35 minutes into the call. 

She's still looping, and I just kinda snap. She asks me a question and I say ""Ma'am, I fully understand you're frustrated and angry. I get it. But I need you to quit interrupting me, because I cannot help you if you keep yelling over me. I need to ask questions. I need you to answer those questions. If you interrupt me, I will terminate this call (I can't actually do this unless they're being foul towards me), and notate your acct that you are being aggressive and will ban you from calling for a week (I don't event think management can do this). Now, are you willing to (she tries to interject her) bah bah bah, I have the floor. Are you willing to work with me?"" She says yes. In a normal voice. Holy shit, it worked. 

We walk through the process. We change her address to what it should be, we are making progress. She even paid me the amt due on one of her cards. Awesome. She apologized for her behavior and I say it's totally alright, we all have moments where we lose our cool. 

I go quiet for a bit because I'm trying to pull up older statements in a system I'm not 100% familiar with. She starts going again, but not yelling. She's looping again too. Welp, shit. And I can't find the old statements, so I can no longer help. Fuck. Someone else is going to have to field this, and to that person, if you're out there, I am fucking sorry. I transfer them to our customer service team, who can see old statements. I explain she wants to go over statements and to have a card sent to her. Introduce and hasta la bye bye. 

End the call at one hour and 5 minutes. I idle out for my break (which was supposed to start a minute after I took this call), and I just sit there. I felt guilty because the CM was working into another loop and the poor bastard who took the call has to deal with her. I also felt relieved. Because fuck that was stressful.",581,0,0

Okay auto pay cancelled due to being behind... odd, but it happens. I've seen people who it's happened to, they set up the wrong amount after months of paying the same. Ez pz, just some crossed wires. 

So, CM explains ""I have X amount for my payment. I was TOLD the minimum would be X"". Oh god fucking dammit. I've done collections before. I love it because I can help people.

She then tells me ""I don't check my statement"". What the fuck are you doing. I check ALL my bills. Every single one. ""I work 7 days a week"". So goddamn what? I understand you're busy,  but you're calling pissed, because you're late. You care about your credit. Yet you don't check your statements? Shit is available online. You can check that whenever. I have to call certain companies to check my bill, and yet you can't bother to GO ONLINE? Excuse? 

All my sympathy is gone. Fuck ya self. We go through everything. She pays. The entire time she's whining about being behind. How another company didn't do this. And I can barely offer sympathy. 

Why should I be sympathetic to someone who isn't be bothered to CHECK THEIR GODDMAN BILL. This isn't my fault. This is on YOU. The company didn't fuck you. You fucked yourself. What the fuck do you say to that?",219,0,0
“My family has all your products”!,"I work for a well known cell phone company. Every time I hear this phrase I know they’re about to ask for something free. 
Lady calls in but the account is her husbands
Me: Ma’am can I have your information so I can pull up your account?
Her: proceeds to give the same information 
Me: okay this is pulling up the same account do you have something that would show your name? I can still help with whatever the issue is regarding your device
Her: we use the same account but he has cancer and just had surgery ( already trying to guilt trip me for asking information that’s REQUIRED to do my job) I guess he can just talk to you.
Me: it’s no problem I’ve created a new account for you
Now on to the issue
Their device is not charging because the charger is broken. Not the device. The charger.. 
Me: okay ma’am have you tried to use another charger
Her: we just bought this the cable should be working
Proceed to check the device and it’s out of warranty by over 200 days..
Me: okay no problem but the device is out of warranty so there will be a charge for the charger
Her: as much as we pay for this and you want to charge me for a charger?!!??!? We just got this, honey didn’t you just get this last year or so? 
Me: ma’am the device has a one year warranty and it’s almost a year past that 
Next thing I know she’s going off on a rant about all the money they spend with us and hangs up lol
I could’ve acted nicer but honestly I’m so tired of people feeling entitleddd. Fingers crossed I don’t get a bad survey",17,0,0
One of the Worst Calls I've Ever Experienced,"I knew the call was going to be bad when I heard a loud sigh after I answered the phone. Before she said a single word, I started slowly inching the volume on my headset and it was a good call because she began yelling right into the phone about how she needed to speak to a supervisor. ""Robin"" was angry about why she wasn't getting a refund. I saw that we had opened a case regarding this matter and it was due to the non-refundable policy of her ticket she had agreed to. It was not a matter of an involuntary cancelation of a flight either, only that the there was a minor schedule change with the flights but they were still operating. 

Robin: I'm very upset and I need to speak to a supervisor. 

Me: I'm very sorry to hear that, Robin, let me see if I can assist you. What are you calling in regards to?

Robin: \*raising her voice\* I'M CALLING ABOUT WHY YOU PEOPLE WON'T GIVE MY REFUND. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK FOR ME, YOUR CLIENT. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ADVOCATE FOR ME AND I HAVE NO FAITH IN YOU ANYMORE. 

Me: \*reviewing the case details\* I see we did not issue you a refund due to the ticket being non-refundable and the flight is still oper- 

Robin: \*interrupting me\* EXCUSE ME, THAT'S RIDICULOUS. THERE'S A PANDEMIC IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD. I'M TIRED OF GOING INTO CIRCLES AND CALLING ABOUT THIS. CAN I SPEAK TO A HIGHER UP?

Me: Certainly, I'll see if one is available. 

Me: Thank you for your patience, Robin, my supervisor isn't available but we can- 

Robin: HOLD ON STOP. I READ HERE (where?) THAT I AM ENTITLED TO A REFUND UNDER THE CONSUMER ACT (???) AND IF YOU DON'T GIVE IT TO ME, I'M REPORTING YOUR COMPANY TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND MAKING A BIG SOCIAL MEDIA POST. 

Me: If you were contesting our investigation regarding this matter, I'd be more than happy to reach out and-

Robin: WHY REINVESTIGATE? JUST GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK. I'M TIRED OF YOU PEOPLE AND YOUR LIES. 

Me: Okay. Did you still want to speak to a supervisor?

Robin: I don't want a supervisor anymore, give me your CEO, give me all of your higher ups, I want their emails and direct phone numbers right now. And give me the email of the supervisor who looked into my case too. 

Me: I would not be able to provide you with any emails of our executives but I can give you a general phone number and address- 

Robin: NO I WANT EMAILS AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU RUN ME OFF THE LINE. I'M TIRED OF BEING TREATED LIKE I'M INSIGNIFICANT. YOU'LL REGRET TREATING ME THIS WAY OVER A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS 

Me: Ma'am, I'm unable to provide you the information requested but I'd be more than happy to have one of my sup-

Robin: NO NO YOU LISTEN TO ME, GET ME YOUR CEO, I WANT EMAILS NOW. I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO SOMEBODY BARELY MAKING MORE MONEY THAN YOU. I'M NOT GETTING OFF THIS CALL UNTIL YOU GIVE THOSE EMAILS.

Me: If I could provide you the info you requested I would but I cannot. 

Robin: I HAVE NO FAITH IN YOUR COMPANY. I'LL GET YOUR CEO'S INFORMATION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AND I'LL MAKE SURE THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS PHONE CALL TOO

Me: Robin, I genuinely am trying to assist you, could I get a callback number for- 

Robin: I DON'T WANT CALLS, I WANT EMAILS 

She kept talking over me, wouldn't listen to me, was being extremely unreasonable, even brought up something about how she'll make a post on social media to ruin us, calls me a liar again. At that point, I realized this call would not go anywhere because she wasn't going to listen to me. 

Me: \*trying to keep my voice from shaking\* Robin, a supervisor will reach out to you in the next 48 hours. If you have no other questions, have a nice day. 

That was the first time I dropped a call and made a note that the caller was being abusive.",185,0,0
