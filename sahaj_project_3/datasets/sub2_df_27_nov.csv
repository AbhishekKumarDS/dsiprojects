The BEL Problem,"Fifteen years ago or so I was still in the middle of my studies but during the summers I worked tech support for a paper mill.

All the regular support calls went to a different group so our team mostly got the tickets that couldn't be handled remotely. So a lot of the stuff we did was hardware swaps, cabling stuff and so on. But sometimes we got problems that were more unique.

&amp;#x200B;

In one of the big factory halls where they made the huge paper rolls whenever one was ready it was transferred to a printing station. There the printing system read an RFID tag from the top of the roll, made a Telnet connection to a central server which received the RFID data and then sent back printer control commands which made the printer print stuff on the top of the paper roll with large red letters. This included the warehouse location so the forklift drivers knew exactly where to store the rolls afterwards.

This system had worked fine for years but at some point a problem appeared. Every once in a while the printer would go haywire and would start printing gibberish on each roll. Rebooting the printer always fixed the problem but every roll that had gone through during this had to be checked manually which caused extra downtime which can cost a lot in that kind of an environment.

They had already tried all the obvious fixes. They'd had the local guys investigating this and the people from the printer system company. They'd changed the printer, changed the cables, changed the nearest network switch etc. Finally for some reason the case ended at our desk and since this was the summer and half the team was on vacation I ended up investigating this.

So, we connected a network analyzer between the printer and the switch in order to find out what exactly was being sent when the printer went crazy. And a day or so later the incident happened again.

I took a look at the traffic log, stared at it for a moment and then went 'Aaaahhhhh'.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've ever used a DOS era PC you probably remember what happens if you start banging at the keyboard toddler style. Beep beep beep beep! The keyboard input buffer gets full and the computer starts beeping at the user to slow down.

Well, this feature was often also implemented in thin clients and if the user connecting to a server tries to type too fast, the server will send back ASCII BEL characters to tell the user's device to beep at the user in the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

So how does this relate to the misbehaving printers?

Well, as luck would have it sometimes the RFID tags on the paper rolls included a little more information than usual. When the system sent out the data from one of these, the data sent to the server was just a little too much to fit directly in the server's buffer and the server would send a BEL character to the printer to tell it to slow down.

However the printer system had no idea how to interpret a BEL character and would send back a ""Unknown command or character."" error message. And as the server's input buffer was already full, it would again reply with more BEL characters.

So the printing system would effectively keep screaming ""Whaaat? Whaaaat?"" at the server while the server would yell back ""Shut up! Shut up!"".

This shouting match continued until the printing system finally crashed and just started printing garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, now I knew the cause but how to fix this? Hmm, maybe...

A quick look at the documentation and I'd found what I was looking for. I opened a Telnet connection to the server with the same user, typed a single command ""SET ALARM OFF"" (or whatever the exact command was) which disabled the BEL replies and went to report that the printer problem was no more.",1072,0,1
Desktop to laptop swap,"So a company I was working for was doing a hardware refresh, and part of the refresh was swapping desktop PCs for laptops for management staff. Basic install of laptop, docking station and dual monitors. 

One morning I got to work and got a panicked call from one my these users claiming her computer isn't working, and it was working last night when she was working from home. She was pretty close so I headed over to her desk to see what was going on instead of trying to troubleshoot over the phone. When I got to her desk I looked at her setup and realized something was missing so asked her where her laptop was. Her response was ""Oh, did I have to bring it in to work with me? Nobody told me that!"". I stood there in stunned silence trying to comprehend the words that came out of her mouth.",1195,0,1
Keyboard broken?,"I have another short and funny story for you guys.
One day a colleague called me and told me as soon as he types something it’s being deleted. 

I wanted to see what he was talking about and connected remotely (He worked in the same building like me, but two levels higher). Same. When I typed something it was instantly deleted up to the point there was nothing left to delete. At some point I had no idea, what the reason could be so I assumed there was something hardware related. 

So I set out and went up to him. Just as I walked though the door I identified the problem.
He had his mobile phone on the desk - but not just on the desk - one corner was directly on the backspace button!

What did I learn over the years? IT Support can sometimes be compared to what doctors do. Quoting a student from House M.D.: “When you hear hooves, don’t initially look for zebras.”",757,0,1
A tale of disappearing media,"Years ago I used to support video editing systems. This particular system used our hardware with Final Cut Pro on a Mac. We used to get a lot of calls that were really Final Cut Pro problems but ""I can get ahold of you and you know what you're talking about."" This was one of those calls.

Customer was capturing media (from tape, told you it was years ago) and while capturing the drives were flashing like you'd expect and the amount of available space on the drives was going down as you'd expect but when the capture ended the media was offline and the file was nowhere to be found.

Montage of hours of troubleshooting. Remember this is before the days of screen sharing when you had to listen to what the customer said and try to dig out that one little tidbit that clued you in to their mistake.

Eventually it is discovered that the customer is starting every clip name with a period ""."" which, in a Unix like operating system such as the Mac OS makes that file hidden. Final Cut is dutifully ignoring the file, thus media is offline, the file is not showing up in the finder but the space is actually used.

""But dear customer, why are you starting file names with a period?""

""I dunno, seemed like a good idea.""

A tale of *Insert interesting title here*,"As evidenced by the title, I'm no writer so this is going to be a quick one. But I hope you get as much joy from reading this as I did from watching it unfold.

I work in app support but we tend to do a bit more than that for our customers, shocker I know. Anywho, a client asked us to set up an excel with a couple queries being pulled from a database. 

I set it up, let the team know, and email the client telling them its ready. I leave for lunch and return to quite the show.

It turns out, some very crucial information was apparently missing from the excel, and the client wasn't very happy about it, he was in fact so disappointed, that he phoned our CEO to complain about our incompetence.

Well, it turns out we weren't the incompetent ones. This professional who works in the client's finance department seems to have forgotten how to use the horizontal scroll on an excel, and was in fact standing on the D column. The oh so crucial information he needed was in columns A to C. 

Go figure...",258,0,1
When you fail to apply critical thinking and it costs 1500 dollars.,"So I worked for a point of sale company. One weekend when I was on call and drinking at the bar across the street I get a call from a manager from a chain full of not bright people, and to compound that most of them weren't even remotely nice, insulting us tech guys every call like they forgot they were twice my age managing a Dennys knock-off 

So the guy calls and said a screen on one of his POS terminals isn't very responsive. I said ok is it dirty? He said no. Ok, let's calibrate it. (These people were using Windows Xp in 2017, that should tell you the condition of the equipment) . Walk him through how to calibrate it. Nope, still barely responsive. But, he said, there's stuff caked all over the screen (contrary to it not being dirty earlier) 

Pos screens are nasty, considering the environment they're in. 

&gt;Ok, so wipe it down with a damp towel. 

&gt;""Won't it damage it?"" 

&gt;""Nah, posiflex terminals have water resistant screens. At the trade shows they'll sometimes have water dripping on the screen to demonstrate that. Screen cleaner would be best but damp towel will work"" 

&gt;""Ok"". Hangs up. 

20 minutes later I get another call, him yelling and swearing about its not working at all, not turning on. 

So I stumble across to my apartment and hop on TeamViewer, can't see it on the network and I start the whole tracing the power cable routine and he goes i put it through the dishwasher and it just stopped working! 

&gt;I said, verbatim ""you ran a computer through a f*cking dishwasher??"" (When I relayed this to my boss the next monday, he didn't even care cause it was so stupid. Swearing at customers isn't professional or ok but this one was kind of an ok one) 

&gt;""You said it was water resistant!"" 

&gt;""I said wipe the screen down! Water resistant is NOT the same as waterproof dude. I mean...."" 

&gt;""Well, I need a new terminal now, so send someone. We are packed and can't go without it""  

A quick check of his sales report and table seating chart determined that was a lie, they were dead and had been all day. 

I told him even if I left right then, going to the office, imaging a new terminal and driving the two hours to get to the site would put me there well after they close and the other three terminals they had should work just fine, especially when the time clock showed just two servers on. 

&gt;""Well, its under warranty, right"" 

&gt;""No, if it has windows XP its well out of warranty at this point, plus your corporate office has to ok all equipment purchases"" (i told him this rather than cause further chaos by telling him doing something that freaking stupid voids warranties) 

After a few moment of awkward silence.. .

&gt;""You better stay out of xyzville"" ( a smaller town that I would never ever go to on my own free will anyways) 

::click:: 



Epilogue: I went back to the bar and kept drinking.

Edit: if you're going to tell me how unprofessional or wrong I am, save your breath. I don't care. I am rough around the edges and I don't take shit from anyone but I also will go through the gates of hell for my clients, even if it means being up all night etc. There's a difference between a customer upset because they have a packed restaurant and their credit cards stopped working and a customer who thinks they're gonna call me up and talk to me like I'm a bitch. One I empathize with and the other I'm gonna tell to screw off. 

Edit 2: per requests, stay tuned for a collection of short stories :D",2434,1,1
Customers never read anything,"I was working as the web dev/digital marketer for a small business that did valentines dinners one year. I was the only IT person so I did all the tech support which wasn’t much. Part of their website was a blog and they had an article about the Valentine’s Day dinner they did explaining what/when it was and who to contact to get tickets.

I get an email one day from my boss saying that some guy has emailed him about the Valentine’s Day dinner tickets and he has no idea what the guy is talking about. I investigate and find the previously mentioned blog post which was made 4 years before I started working there. I think maybe this guy just got confused and thought it was this year but then I click on the link to the post.

The text: “VALENTINES DAY DINNER ON: the date 4 years ago” is written in huge red text directly in the middle of the screen. This guy somehow found this 4 year old blog post, didn’t read the huge text telling him it happened 4 years ago, but read through the paragraph of 10pt text at the bottom of the page telling him who to email about tickets.",281,0,1
Two computers. Neither stay connected to the network.,"I just spent 3 hours troubleshooting Karen Snowflake's WiFi issues.

Two computers.  One fairly new and the other brand new.  Neither will stay connected to her WiFi.

I go through everything with her.  Round and round.  Literally hours.  Thought it was the new computer until I had her switch back to her old computer and it was having similar issues.

I finally remote in and, she's connected to the free open Xfinity Hotspot.

She's clearly been through this before because she starts going off on me.  I'm ruining her Thanksgiving week.   She wants someone else (I'm the **4TH** person to help her with this) and she absolutely refuses to plug the fucking network cable in.

I've been doing this a LONG time.  Over 20 years.  And it's been a long long time since I've had someone make me feel this shitty for trying to help them.",1025,0,1
"I Need a Second Monitor, For Mail Merge","Meant to post some tales for a while, used to work IT in a call center that accepted pament for other companies. That's a bit vague enough to not get me in trouble. The whole operation was the kind of place you go into every day and are genuinely surprised they isn't a massive raid. 

Anyway, one of my favorite issues was a user we'll call Aurora, one of three administrative assistants to a director we will call Matt. And before you have any real sympathy for her, she was in her 30s and has a 4-yr degree for administrative assistant.

Before I drive in, the IT department is a 4-man team, a boss and three subordinates. Our boss has a ""unique"" background, with fast food management and a 2yr ITT style computer programming degree. I have a 4yr Information Systems &amp; Operations Management degree. He is at best a good IT guy, someone you call when your system isn't working. Open a shop, build your small business a web page, get you through basic tech support. Which is what he was hired to do. And then the company grew, rapidly. He managed to drop enough jargon to sound like he had subject mastery, and was very pliable. A people pleaser. Someone who just wanted to come to work, fix people's problems, be liked, do his job, keep his nose down, and rinse, lather, repeat until retirement.

In no way was he a CIO, he didn't have the management background, the skills, the understanding, or the desire. For as much as I hated him when I left for how absolutely insane the job had become. It took a long time to look back and realize that the real issue was, he was a 20 something kid, who wanted to make some money, hired to do a job and then thrown into a position he didn't want and couldn't handle, and didn't know what to do. He was trapped. 

I tried to help him. I really, sincerely did. I accepted that I was going to effectively need to spend a large amount of effort getting him, and keeping him, up to speed. Trying to explain everything I had learned (and put myself in a debt hole to get) in a totally different 4yr degree program. And he at least said as much, that we were bassakward. I had his job and he had mine.

He was a Bs and C's programmer, good, but ""agile"" in every negative connotation of that word. Not Agile as in the methodology, but agile in every criticism ever leveraged against agile developers. In the sense of bang it out, make it ""work,"" don't waste time validating and documenting, and move on to something else, ""good code documents itself!"" 

That could go into it's own story, and I'm getting long winded already. Short version, this happened while he was still accepting help, heads ups, and hadn't checked out of the whole situation.

So anyway, into the story.

Aurora is tasked with sending receipts for payments if the customer has requested one. Every day she gets a file emailed to her, in a delimited format. Should be a simple open in excel, slight clean up, save, run a mail merge. A fairly quick process.

This is also at a point in which we have just gone through a major monitor swap out, CRT to LCD, and while we have a closet full of CRTs that we could have handed back out like candy, if only more than a few computers in the building supported a second monitor, of course the user wants an LCD, and also has a computer that won't support a second monitor.

Then came the phone call, which boiled down to ""Hi, I need a second LCD monitor, Matt said it was okay.""

""Okay, and why are you needing a second monitor?""

""Mail merge, it just takes me forever to do the receipt letters with only one screen.""

""R-i-g-h-t. Okay, I can come over to your desk and see what your process is so I can document how this will help.""

""Matt said it was okay.""

""I understand that, but we still need to demonstrate a business need for the expense.""

""Uh, well, I already ran the letters today, you'll have to wait until tomorrow. And I don't understand what the big deal is, Matt said it was okay, so I don't understand why you won't just get me a second monitor. But fine, whatever, see you tomorrow. *CLICK*""

User is know to be a PITA, Matt is a known PITA. So I document carefully, send a message to my boss about the request and the plan to document the need. And bring up the most obvious question, ""we have a letter vendor, why are we actively printing and mailing receipts when there is a pre-formed letter in the system that can be requested and sent through the letter vendor?""

So, next morning, knowing when she gets the report, I pop over to her desk, ""oh, I don't have time to do those now, I have these other reports to work on.""

""Okay, well, just give me a call when you are ready to start on those and I'll come right over."" 

Whole day, no call, so at 4pm I call her, voicemail.

Next morning, first thing, call her. ""Hey, what happened, I thought you were going to call me when you were going to run letters.""

""Oh, I told Matt what you said and that I really just couldn't do them since you wouldn't get me a monitor. He said he'd take it up with your boss during the staff meeting.""

""Oh, okay. Thanks for letting me know.""

*Grumble, grumble, grumble*

Emailed my boss a heads up, included a quote for the second monitor and a new computer, as her's was a bit of a clunker (not a ""bad"" machine, but very low spec, older, but more than enough for her job description), and adding a dual display video card would have been a bit pointless, sort of like a pimp my ride where the car is shot but they add in a bunch of cool tech. 

Got the expected ""WTF?! Thanks for the heads up.""

Staff meeting occurs, I find out later that before it could even start, Matt began screaming at my boss that I ""refused to help Aurora and now she can't do her job."" Boss is able to fire back with a total of equipment needed, and that we were trying to simply document the business need, which she had refused, in order to justify the expense. And that, furthermore, we were a bit confused about why this issue was an issue, as not only should she not need a second monitor to do that, but that he couldn't understand in the first place how this was a task she performed anyway. Why aren't we requesting the letter in the system with every other letter.

Cue hot headed curse laden rant from Matt about how stupid and useless IT was, how his department makes all the money we were ""so worried"" about spending, and how utterly ridiculous it was to have to fight to get a stupid monitor from us given how much money was wasted by IT. 

Basically this was how every staff meeting went, what should have been a couple hours, ended up being an all day boxing match. Each department head trying to find someone else to blame, or trying to disappear into the carpet. Save Matt, the undisputed champion of blame and shame.

Ultimately, Aurora is told to call us the next time she runs letters so ""stupid IT can fill out a form and check a box or whatever.""

So she does, I go over. 

She. Is. Not. Doing. A. Mail. Merge.

She, opening the file in Excel, is taking a letter saved in one file and creating a new document, hand counting rows in Excel (I wish I were kidding), copying and then pasting her saved ""template"" mail merge letter into the new document until she has as many pages as her count. Then she goes through, manually changing the date on each letter, and hand retyping every single bit of the file data into the letter. Clicking back and forth between Word and Excel to do so.

First name, last name, address line 1, address line 2, city, state, zip, our account number, client name, client account number, first name, last name for greeting, account previous balance, payment amount, account balance.

For hundreds of letters.

Then deleting one of three paragraphs, and copying and pasting account balance again if necessary (paragraphs are effectively your account is paid in full, your account was paid in settlement, your account has a balance remaining. 

Did I mention, hundreds of letters.

Then going back through and manually typing Mr/Mrs for the name prefix. 

Again, for those in the back, FOR HUNDREDS OF LETTERS. And by best guess, the prefix wasn't in the file she received. Kim is a MRS, Sam is a MR, and D'Nesha or Rudra is whatever she felt like. You get the idea, she's just randomly getting it right or wrong, and not caring. 

Then printing them out, not on company letterhead, not even the cheap stuff we had for the times that we needed to ""send an official letter"" (but not in a fine letterhead needed way), but instead on plain white paper, so no return address or any indication the receipt wasn't something someone just typed up on their own computer.

Then hand folding them, despite the 1/3 folding machine.

Then she took the stack and hand typed Avery style address labels. One. At. A. Time. Running a 30-up sheet of labels through the laser printer 30 times. For hundreds of labels. Labeling each envelope as she went. One run for the return address, one for the mailing address. 

Oh yes, you read that correctly. She didn't grab the nice pre-printed company envelopes, she didn't grab the cheap company pre-printed envelopes, she didn't use the windowed statement envelopes and just adjust her letter format to show the information in the windows, she used plain white envelopes.

Then postage metered them, all of them. Leaving them unsealed. 

Why, oh why, unsealed you ask? Because then they were put on Matt's desk for review. Because Matt thought it was ridiculous and wasteful to send letters unless they were ""warranted."" What was warranted, well, that was up to him to decide. Some customers got a letter for every payment, some only for final payments, some never got a letter. So he went through and whittled the stack down from hundreds of letters to whatever he thought was appropriate. Trashed the ""un-warranted"" letters and envelopes, and handed the ""warranted"" letters back to Aurora.

Who promptly taped the returned letters shut, and left for the post office at 3:45pm. Dropped the mail off before collection, and then went and ran any other errands that he needed her to run, eventually getting back to the office at some point after 5pm.

And, if you haven't caught it yet, he never noticed they had already been run through the postage machine, so the postage he thought he was saving the company, was literally being thrown away. Not to mention this task, was about 80% of her day. And we were paying her mileage, for using her personal vehicle to go to the post office, separate from the other employee who also went to the post office, and collected mileage. And we were ending up paying her overtime because she didn't clock out until 5:30-6pm. 

I asked for the criteria Matt was using to choose warranted vs unwarranted letters. Never heard back.

I modified the file she received (adding a field to generate a letter type for the three paragraphs selection), created a proper mail merge template (in two formats, one for window envelope and one for cheap company pre-printed envelope) including conditional statements to parse the letter type field and include the appropriate paragraph, made a proper label printing template for use on the cheap company pre-print envelope so label sheets (except when reused due to partial prints) would run through the printer just once (so much explained about why her printer needed a maintenance kit all the time), pointed out that there was a machine to fold the letters, explained to her (shock/horror/surprise/amusement) that ""no, just because you don't put a metered letter in the mail, that doesn't mean the postage wasn't used"" (""but, like it's a barcode, don't they like have to scan it to charge us?"").

I literally made it near idiot proof to do her job. I made it take a few minutes instead of her whole day.

And what, oh what do you think this got me. A ""thank you,"" a pat on the back, high fives, appreciation for saving the company money, brownie points?

No. It got me told to order her a new computer, two brand new monitors, and tasked with fixing the file she received, setting up her new computer and monitors, and told to never do that again.

You see, Matt didn't appreciate that I dared to ask about his ""warranted"" vs ""unwarranted"" criteria, found it completely inappropriate that I would tell his employee how to do her job, was absolutely foaming at the mouth by the time he got to the shear incompetence of my comment about postage, virtually murderous that I had the audacity to suggest anything about his processes that I so clearly was too stupid to understand (using letter vendor), and filled with righteous fury that I should be fired immediately for insubordination. 

My boss, blindsided, saw the writing on the wall. He either gets what he wants or this becomes a never ending war.

So, she got her second monitor, a new computer for it, a ""fixed"" file, a ton more maintenance kits for her printer, and to keep doing what she was doing.

And I got to keep my job. While effectively wearing a target on my back and walking through a gun range.",358,0,1
"""I can't log into the computer.""","I work for a small hospital in the middle of nowhere in the southwestern region of the US.  I've come to realize doctors and nurses are really knowledgeable about the human body but not so much about computers. There is a lot of hand holding involved.

Today, a student nurse called me with my fav problem, ""I can't log into the computer.""

Now this one drives us all crazy.  We have AD running but also various medical programs that can't be hooked into AD, so almost everyone has at least 2 logins to remember. (I love it when users complain about having ""so many passwords to remember.  ""Come work in IT! We have even more!""

After 5 months in this position, I know when users call with this complaint, I need to ask them right away, ""Are you trying to log into windows or (electronic medical record program - EMR)?""

User: ""Windows.""

Me: ""Then I'm going to reset your network password.""

I log into AD, have her verify her identity including her login name, unlock her account, reset  the password and give her the default password.

User: ""Okay, thanks. So, what do I put in when it asks for the server info?""

Me: *blink blink blink* ""Wait. What do you mean server info?""

User then describes the login screen for our EMR software.

Me: ""Oh. You're trying to log into the EMR. Give me a moment and I'll reset that password for you.""

So I log in to that system, reverify her identity, reset her password, give her the ip address the EMR was asking for, and have her try to log in.

I can hear the user mumbling as the types: ""Okay so (network login name) here and (default password for EMR) here.""

Me: ""Wait a minute. You need to use your EMR user name to log into the EMR program."" 

Silence.

User:"" What?""

Me:""You know the log in name you gave me when I was resetting you EMR password? Use that name.""

User: ""But I've always used (network login) to get into EMR!""

Me: ""Well, I'm not sure how you did that but to get into EMR you have to use (EMR login name).""

User: *queue lots of grumbling and typing* ""It's not working. Are you sure it's (EMR login name)?""

Bits &amp; Bytes,"I was working on a transcription project where data was being replicated from one city to the other and because of the high change rate, it had to be done asynchronously. Raw data would come in at the primary site, get processed, and was returned to the end client for their use. My client didn’t want to replicate the processed data, just the raw, since it could be redone at any time and was considered more critical than the final product. 

The problem was they had to use uncompressed audio files in order for the software to be able to make the best transcription, which were freaking huge in comparison to the final document files. They wanted them kept in case a transcript was wrong to compare them against.

This is probably going to give away what I was working on, but it’s critical to the story. Data at site A and was snapshotted from a primary disk to a secondary, then sent over Ma Bell to site B. Once at site B, it landed on a mirror of the site A secondary disk until the packets were complete, then snapshotted to a primary disk at site B. It wasn’t a single disk doing this, dozens were constantly being written to and copied over the wire to the other site all the time. This is a really simplistic way of describing it, but I’m avoiding using the exact verbiage so I don’t give them away.

Anyway, I was asked to come in and implement my “product” using a new procedure that hadn’t yet gotten a formal support write up yet. This was a one-off that later I found had been grudgingly given approval for and if it worked, it would be worked up into something “real.” Everything was set up and when it was turned on, we were shocked at how much data was being sent over the wire and how far “out of track” it was. Data was being BLASTED down the wire, almost saturating it although the client insisted the data change rate was correctly sized for the line.

I ended up in a major northeastern city during a snowstorm so I could be at the site B datacenter to complete the switchover from catch-up to asynchronous mode. I couldn’t physically get to the site because of the snow, so I hooked up my Motorola Razr to my laptop and dialed into the machine from my hotel room. I knew the data flow slacked off at 11:30p – midnight, so I sat and watched as it slowly dropped lower and lower towards the 10,000 track threshold where I could switch to async.

15,000… 14,000… 13,000… 12,000… 11,000… 10,900… 10,950... Wait, what? 11,000… 12,000… 13,000…

The window started at about 11:35 and lasted a whole 10 minutes before climbing back up. Just for giggles, I tried issuing the command anyway but it failed. So, I copied my logs and put them in an email to everyone concerned and asked, “What now?” Well, what now was the client flipping out and calling us incompetent, demanding to know why I couldn’t make it happen.

I’d been putting in 12-16+ hour days on this, working overnight and weekends, traveling back and forth to site B to get it done. My boss said, “Hang on, Joe’s been putting in a lot of time on this, so let’s get a second opinion,” and a national SME was brought in to analyze everything and do a root cause analysis. He’s also a good friend too, but I knew he would tell the absolute truth in this, no matter who was to blame.

The  RCA call started out with him going over everything, explaining that he’d analyzed the nominal data traffic, adding in the new traffic, and explaining how it all worked together. His part went something like this:

“After sampling the data flow at both ends, the system, with acks is sending bidirectionally about 38.5 megabits per second, which works out to be a little over 4.8 megabytes per second, using all the capacity of the wire.”

(The lightbulb was coming on in my head at this.)

“So what?” The client PM exploded, “We’ve got a 45-megabyte circuit!”

“No, you don’t.”

“Yes, we do!”

“No, you have a DS3 circuit, which is 45 megaBITS. That’s 5.65 megaBYTEs per second at maximum transfer rate. 0.8 megaBYTES isn’t enough to allow the normal data traffic between sites without the new system. It’s simply not big enough.”

I never heard the man utter another word and I never heard from him again.

I’d had enough and asked my boss to move me off the project, which he gladly did. Last I heard they’d upped the bandwidth between the sites and it was working fine.

The moral of the story is, do the math, know what a bit is and know what a byte is.",884,0,1
"""It doesn't turns on""... Well, it doesn't even have hard drive...","Some hours ago, i was ending a work in my client's house.

I can't even call my doctor,"Customer called in today complaining that they are completely unable to make phone calls, and our service is absolutely horrendous and it needed to be fixed right away. He said he was needing to call his doctor right away and no matter what he did, the call wouldn't go through. I asked him, before asking anything else, if he could make or receive calls from any other number. He assured me that he couldn't, that he was using his brother's phone to call me, and it was the dumbest question he ever heard. He spent an hour yelling and complaining. Finally, he said that he had to deal with my ""stupidity"" all while his town was being rebuilt. I probed into what he could have meant by that... It turned out a bad storm hit his town...

Top of modem has been stolen!!!!!!!!,"First post, be gentle.

I used to work tech support for a British ISP.

One day I got a call from a panicked customer who told me that someone stole the top half of her modem. Now English is my second language, and even though I'm fairly confident in my English my first thought was that the lady was using some form of slang.

It was years ago so it might not be verbatim but the conversation vent something like this:

Me: What do you mean someone stole the top of your modem?

OL(old lady): I mean my modem was fine when I left the house and when I was back the top of the modem was gone!!!

Me: Do you see any wires coming out of the modem?

OL: No, the top half is just missing.

Me: (This is verbatim) Ma'am I don't understand the modem doesn't have a top or bottom half, it's one solid box, someone would have had to break in to your house, saw the modem in half and take the top part, but leave everything else in the house?

OL: I don't know

Now I was thinking ""maybe she's thinking about something else""

Me: Ma'am can you go to your computer and try to go to any website?

OL: Is BBC ok? (*British Broadcasting Corporation, not the other BBC*).

Me: Sure.

OL: Yes I'm on their page now.

Me: Ok, that means you still have internet. Can you go to the modem and see if there are any lights on?

OL: Yes, give me a minute.

OL: Oh... it got knocked over... -click-

Yeah. The OL couldn't see the top of the modem and immediately assumed someone stole it, even though it just fell over on it's back side.",1728,0,1
My phone has no WiFi,"Here a short story from my everyday fun:

Besides other IT coordination stuff I’m doing some IT support for my colleagues in a German company but with English as main communication language, because we are a multicultural company (this is important to know for my story, and you must know that WiFi is called WLAN in German).

One day I got a call from a colleague telling me, her phone has no WiFi. Her office buddy’s phone has WiFi (same phone model) but she can’t find it on her phone. I asked her what the system language on her phone was and she said German.

Well there we had it. I asked her if she could find “WLAN” in her settings. She said yes. Mmmmhhh...

Microsoft Mail bane to my existence,"So with the pandemic going on and more people working from home, I’ve been tasked with moving people over to laptops. A couple of weeks ago I get a request to setup the laptop for a user and their needs. Nothing special aside from having Office 365, Chrome and remote control software.

Now this particular user for some reason keeps using Microsoft Mail even though I had setup Outlook for them and I did not configure Mail for them so they initially set it up.  User comes in the other day to pickup laptop and I get an email from an assistant saying their email is not setup with a prompt to setup. Seeing how I know this user initially is using Microsoft Mail and I didn’t configure it for them, I reply back to make sure the user is running Outlook and not Microsoft Mail as I knew that’s what she’s done in the past. I tasked the assistant to check one thing for me and she says it is not working in a reply.

So now I call back the user and instruct her on how I connect to her so I can see what is going on.  Sure enough the user is running Microsoft Mail. I then tell her how I know you don’t know any better but I specially asked the assistant to check that you are running Outlook rather than Mail and they fail to follow simple instructions.

Cue the next day. I get an email from another user that all her notes are missing from Outlook after I had to reinstall OS from scratch after a failed update.  I detail a link on how to open up Notes in Outlook and thought that was it. I then get another reply saying she can’t do signatures now too. At this point this is where I see the tag line in her reply message, “Sent from Mail for Windows 10.”  This wouldn’t be so bad if the fact that many years ago she would have been the technical contact for computer issues.",144,0,1
The pound sign,"I had a ticket come through yesterday to help a gentlemen having issues with his email on his iPhone. We recently migrated to a new exchange server so calls for email issues were plentiful.

Sir: Yes yes, give me a minute to pull over. Don’t go to fast, I am an old man and don’t do technology well. 

I knew this was going to be an exciting call. 

I begin walking him through to delete old account and set up new exchange server account. 
I told him to put in his email and then gave him his new password xyz#abc (not actual password but in this format). He tells me it keeps saying password is invalid. After three attempts I told him to give me a moment and check that I had the right password (even though I knew it was right).
I gave him the password again and again said it out phonetically so there was no confusion xyz#abc Xray, Yankee, Zulu pound sign Alpha Bravo Charlie. I told him to repeat it back to me as he typed it. Invalid password again. I am now thinking I am going to be really pissed if I have to drive to his office to fix his phone. I used the “pound sign” instead of “hashtag” thinking he wouldn’t know what a hashtag was. 
I ask him, sir, are you typing pound, hitting the pound key, or selecting the pound symbol? He says, yes I am bringing up the phone and hitting the pound sign then go back and continue to type my password. 

No sir, you need to hit the “123” button then the “up arrow” then the pound sign on the keyboard. 
Sir: it worked that time and brought me into my email. 
Me: Outstanding. It should take a few minutes for your new emails to start coming through. Call me with any more issues if you have them.

Never trust your client. Ever.,"I have been working for a near 3 years at a call center providing IT support so I am still quite fairly new but I learned quick. During the beginning we go over a lot of training over some of the software we use, major/minor troubleshooting, resolves, call taking, how-to, etc etc... During a week of training for remote user support, I was with someone who taught me a golden rule. Never trust your client/caller ever.

This has always been on my mind to make sure I always understand the full story and asking correct questions before diving in. But sometimes... I give in and trust the caller to shave a few minutes off a call or sometimes simply because it makes sense to.

Never again.

Normal day, normal calls. One call comes in, it was transferred from one of my colleagues who was training someone. *Lady* tells me the following even before being introduced after being transferred:

Lady: ""I cannot type at all and its not working, My system is frozen and my monitor is not responding""  
Me to myself: here we go... what the hell is she even talking about.  
Me: ""Hi ma'am, I'll be taking over this call moving forward. What exactly do you mean you cannot type?""  
Lady: ""It's just not working, I type and its not working, the previous guy told me to unplug my monitor and reboot test it, didn't work, plug the monitor back in and its still just not working""  
Me to myself: what the hell kind of troubleshooting is that? What wasn't I told from the previous agent, oh my god this is going to be a long one.  
Me: ""Can you click on the-""  
Lady: ""NO I CANT EVEN CLICK""

First of all, she was using a laptop that was connected to their monitor. Normal stuff, they just couldn't do anything, we unplug the monitor and had them use the laptop as normal. I told them to just log into the system with the laptop keyboard and mouse. It worked. We got in, got them connected and I remoted on to see what the hell they were doing with this monitor shenanigans.

Immediately I get a key test running, they test out their external keyboard and no keys are registering. Device manager showed no external mouse or keyboard connected. Nothing in windows settings &gt; devices either.

We plug the monitor back in to see what all of the monitor shenanigans was about because she was telling me how it had something to do with the monitor because of the last agent that was helping them...

I find out they had their keyboard and mouse connected to the actual monitor running as kind of like a docking station. Magically, the keyboard and mouse show up windows settings &gt; devices as a COMBO. (one USB for both devices... shenanigans if you ask me)

Key test again, keyboard doesn't work. Mouse is working now(???). Had them unplug the USB from their monitor which took a while cause they couldn't find it... And had them plug in directly to their laptop. Mouse worked, but not keyboard.

What the hell? I decide well, maybe its something with the drivers... or the keyboard is dead?

Me: ""Does the keyboard usually emit any light at all?""  
Lady: ""No""  
Me: ""By chance does your keyboard run off of batteries?""  
Lady: ""Yea it has batteries but changing them didn't fix it""  
Me: ""Is everything in correctly?""  
Lady: ""Yes""  
Me: ""Could we swap out the batteries again maybe? Maybe we got one with no juice in it left""  
Few minutes go by...

Lady: ""Its still not working, only the mouse works.""

OK I guess I can't get much more information from that. I have to kind of *trust* them on this one. I won't even bother asking them for the model because they really sound like they wouldn't know. I was really over the day and wanted to get this call over with, fix it, move on.

I start looking at drivers, uninstall, reboot, reinstall, same issue, took a further look to see if for whatever reason the keyboard had internal storage, maybe for whatever reason it was being blocked by our system policies... whatever.

We're pretty deep into this call given it takes a lot of time for them to reboot, test things, the occasional ""brb"" or ""hold on real quick"" and even the ""no I don't know"" that makes our lives a bit harder.

What could it even be? I was honestly just about to tell them that hey were SOL here, lets get you a new keyboard.

Lady was fiddling around for a while in the middle of looking at everything and me being completely stumped and about to send them documents for a keyboard replacement.

Lady: ""Oh you know what, the nub of the battery is supposed to be on the spring right?""  
*(the nub by the way, hahahahaha)*  
Me: ""No, definitely not, its supposed to be the other way around.""  
*facepalm*

Keyboard now works like a charm.

Sometimes we overlook the simple things because we put too much trust into our client. 

The golden rule: never trust your client ever.

TL;DR Caller had their monitor acting as a docking station for their laptop which did not work for their keyboard, their keyboard batteries were in wrong. (+ and - on wrong ends)",214,0,1
The mute button is your friend,"Not long after Y2K, I was working for a credit card company supporting their payment processing center. The whole company was huge, multiple thousands of employees, but our little branch was a modest hundred or so, and was located across the country from the main branches (which were in San Francisco, if I recall correctly).

Payment processing was conceptually simple, if technically complex. Customers send in checks. Thirty or forty people open envelopes and scan checks. Another twenty people read the scans and verify amounts. And I mostly sit around waiting for my favorite users to call.

It was the weekend. I’d started my shift with the usual calls (lead operator fatfingered her password again, somebody managed to get an envelope into the check scanner and was afraid to open the machine to clear the jam, etc), and was settling down to start rotating tapes in the backup queue, when the phone rang. The lead operator reported, “Nothing is working.”

I knew her. Nice lady, smart, about as technical as a Labrador retriever. So I headed over to see what she meant. I hurried, because she’d sounded fairly alarmed.

When I reached the center, everybody was standing around talking. They looked at me like I was a movie star or something- I mean, they all stopped talking and stared, with hope and joy on their faces. It was eerie.

The lead showed me her computer, which was supposed to be tracking progress on the company WAN. It was connected to the LAN, but the WAN was down.

I jogged back to the server room, phoning my boss to warn him. He was in his car by the time I’d reached the server room. Where the WAN showed no problems.

I called the NOC group in San Francisco. They eventually answered, listened to my report, and told me, “Yeah, hang on, Andrew’s in charge of that.” (sound effect of somebody tapping his phone but not quite pressing the mute button).

Andrew's voice came on in the background of the call. “Vox Popsicle? He’s an arrogant bastard, I don’t want to talk to him.”

I replied, “Look, you don’t have to like me, but I have fifty people making ten bucks an hour not working due to the WAN.”

Immediate sound effect of the mute button actually being pressed.

They had us reconnected in about forty minutes.

I told my boss about it; I thought it was funny. What a faceless NOC guy thought about me doesn’t bother me. My boss was less amused. I never heard what happened to Andrew, but my boss was a former military drill sergeant, and could tear strips off of you without raising his voice or swearing.

I did, however, learn what caused the outage. Andrew came in on the weekend, looked around the San Francisco office and saw no workers, so decided to take down the servers that took our data. The network was still up, so our WAN was technically still working, but the destination servers were offline. He figured that since the big office was empty, nobody would be using the servers.

"Technician who yelled ""YOU PIECE OF SH*T,"" over the phone got fired","Backstory: French colleague (We're an international company) called me and asked me if I knew how to make a certain software package work on a server. It was something complicated and required some experience with the product. I said that I'd take the call, but my French isn't super duper. I can understand it fine most of the time, but sometimes I'm looking for the right word to say and that can make me go ""Oui uhhhh c'est un uhmmm probleme avec le serveur et uhh..."".

Here's how the call went (translated, of course). 

Me: Tea - Client: C

&gt;Tea: Tea speaking  
&gt;  
&gt;C: Ah, another one? Okay, you're going to fix my problem right?  
&gt;  
&gt;Tea: Good afternoon to you too, sir. With what may I be of service?  
&gt;  
&gt;C: Fix your shit software and make sure it works. I've already been talking to your colleague and he can't make it work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tea: Whoa, okay, calm down, I'll -  
&gt;  
&gt;C: Here's the fucking Teamviewer ID

So rather than make a fuss about it, I just logged in to see what I could do. The software was installed, but nothing had been programmed yet. Mind you, we normally only sell this software to people who have followed training to make it work.

&gt;Tea: Ah yes, I see. Nothing is programmed yet.   
&gt;  
&gt;C: Yeah? Well, go on then. Program it. Make sure it works.

In the meanwhile I hear him chatting with the client and some other people, laughing and making jokes while being incredibly rude to me. I make a note in the ticket. 

Because I couldn't be assed with dealing with anymore shit, I figured I'd just program it for him (doesn't take me that long) and then report it to sales. 

As I was programming it, it required me to reset certain settings on another software on the same server, one he had already 'programmed' himself. As I wanted to click on the ""YES"" button to confirm that I wanted to do a reset, he started shouting.

&gt;C: W-What're you doing?  
&gt;  
&gt;Tea: ...A reset.  
&gt;  
&gt;C: Wh- No. NO. Don't DO IT.   
&gt;  
&gt;Tea: We need to reset it so I can reconfigure some things. It'd take too long to program everything again by hand, and the default settings will make it go fast-  
&gt;  
&gt;C: NO. DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO PROGRAM THIS?

At this point I couldn't care any less, so I just hit the yes button and there it went. Then I got a bunch of swear words thrown at my head. In French, of course.

&gt;C: PUTAIN. YOU PIECE OF SHIT. YOU DOG. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE (it went on for a while)

So I just muted the call, finished configuring it, showed him it worked and he just hung up on me without saying thank you or sorry.

I made a call to sales, he requested the recording of the call and after listening to it he called the technician's boss.

He got fired because this apparently wasn't the first time he's been rude in general. He's been rude to co-workers, clients, his boss, etc. The last drop was that he also was super rude to us, their supplier.

Vendor said it was not their fault – Turns out they were right,"I assist in network engineering for a school district on a contract (monthly / as needed / project) basis. They have a cloud vendor for their financials. A site to site VPN, managed by the vendor makes the connection between the district and the vendor. The vendor replaced the aging ASA with a shiny new one. Immediately problems started happening. The VPN tunnel would drop. Traffic from the district side would not initiate the VPN. Traffic from the vendor side would. The workaround was to keep ping traffic going over the link to keep it up and when it dropped, call the vendor, reference a ticket number, and ask them to do the same thing. The tunnel would come up until something caused it to drop again.

Calls to the Vendor support gave some variation of they have thousands of sites just like this one, it must be our fault. The district position was that it happened just after replacing the ASA, so it must be an issue with the new ASA.

In an attempt to break the impasse, it was suggested that they logon to the ASA and debug the VNP while it was trying to be established from our end. That idea was met with stony silence. The attitude of the vendor was, to say the least, a bit off putting.

We soon had bigger fish to fry, so this moved to the back burner as so often happens when a functional work-around is in place.

The light bulb went off when we were working on the load balancer configuration. The district has a state assigned public IP address range. This network sits outside the firewall. The VPN appliance public side sits in this network and has the load balancer as its default gateway. There is an interconnect network to the state router. The state router forwards all traffic for the assigned range to the load balancer. There are two additional network connections off the load balancer. A rule was found in the load balancer to forward all traffic from the state router, addressed to the state assigned network through with no NAT. What was missing was the reverse rule.

In hindsight, it all made sense. When they initiated the traffic, the load balancer would allow the traffic to traverse without NAT and the tunnel came up. When the district tried to initiate the tunnel, the load balancer would NAT it to one (random) IP address and of course the tunnel would fail. The simple solution was to create a rule to pass the traffic from the ASA through to the state router without NAT. Problem solved.

How did it work before? Good question. My only hypothesis at this time (they do not wish to discuss the issue with details) is that in the previous configuration their end was sending keepalive traffic and trying to initiate the tunnel when it went down. New system, new rules, and we get a new result.

Sometimes the vendor is correct when they say it is not their fault. Even when they have an attitude about it.

Tale from a school technology facilitator during Corona," I work as a tech facilitator for a school, and as part of our job responsibility we take helpdesk calls for remote learners. I received a call from a concerned parent trying to figure out how to do an assignment. They assignment sounds like a worksheet that they are supposed to fill out. Easy, right?

The parent sounded pretty competent so I decided to just remote in and see what was up. Embeded in canvas is a google doc that the student can edit and submit. Only problem is that the teacher literally just snipped the pages in so they are un-editable. She requires that students highlight information on the page and answer the questions, only problem being that both are impossible on a picture element in docs.

I read over the assignment instructions and it requests that students use a chrome extension called kami, a pdf annotation tool. So it doesn't even work on the embeded docs file, nor can you save as pdf and submit because there is no option to upload files. 

I had a few ideas on non elegant solutions, but I wanted to hear how the teacher wanted it.

I call up the teacher and put the parent on hold:

Me: ""So, I see this annotation assignment here, what is the proper workflow process to get this assignment done?""

Teach: ""you use kami""

Me: ""yes but that is for *pdfs* not *google documents""*

Teach: ""well that's for them to figure out, other students have submitted the assignment""

Me: ""interesting, so how do you open up kami with google docs?""

Teach: ""I don't know I just see it from my side that they do. I instructed that any students having problems need to get their parents to drive them to school and have the front office staff help them""

Me: ""well I can't figure it out, and I'm a tech facilitator at &lt;school&gt;""

Teach: ""thats on you, *I'm not the tech guy, you are""*

I then call up the front office staff and ask them how they did it. Turns out they would save the document to pdf, open it with kami, annotate, then redownload as a annotated pdf, then take screenshot of the work, then post those screenshots into the google docs page, and then submit.

"The Lucky Buckeye – Part 2 or, let the magic begin","A story from “back in the day,” the day in question was when Novell was king. I was working for a small VAR in a medium sized city. We had an overflow contract with the local school district.

In [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/jxbkb4/the_lucky_buckeye_part_1/), I explained where I got the Buckeye and how it “fixed” a server by just tapping it,

After working in a school system for a short while, it became apparent that the staff feel a need to ask a question that they are afraid for the answer. “How did you fix it?” or “What was wrong?” You can almost see them cringe as they expect an onslaught of techno babble to be coming at them. I truly feel for them.

Now experience had taught me that the only reliable information on the work order was the room number. Everything else was suspect. My modus operandi was to find the room, inquire about the issues, and fix whatever issues they describe. Then I would write-up whatever I did and close the ticket.

I got one of the overflow jobs for the district administration center. They could not print. This was back in the day of the stand alone JetDirect appliances. Some will remember the box with power, Ethernet, and a parallel port. I found two ladies who showed me the printer and explained they could not print. Easy fix, reset to default and rebuild the configuration. Then back to the ladies for them to test.

Me: Please try printing now.

Lady: It works. What did you do? \[I see her tensing for the reply\]

Me: I tapped it with my lucky Buckeye. (Pull it out of my pocket to show her) I then relate how this lucky Buckeye fixed a server at work (See part 1).

Lady: (Silence for a moment)

Me: No really, I just reset it to factory defaults and rebuilt the configuration.

To say this lady got excited might be a bit of an understatement. She gushed about Buckeyes. Then she wanted to set me up with her sister (or some other relative, I am a bit hazy on the details)

I do not know if the Buckeye was lucky or not, but it was magic. I carried it with me for quite a while. The Buckeye and the story opened the minds of many school district staff to get the answer to the question that they were dreading, without the techno babble.

I have learned to love giving folks answers they don’t expect.",139,0,1
"A tale about respect, manners, and how IT fired more than 100 guests","A recent ""Karen"" story I read reminded me that last year I had an encounter of that sort which I didn't post about yet. For your entertainment, here it is.

First a little background info to set the scene:

&amp;#x200B;

Our company HQ building has big conference rooms. Despite not being in the events or hosting business at all, we sometimes rent those out if we don't need them ourselves. Only B2B, we only offer little service but that makes for a fair rate, all usually easy going, not much work and earns a few extra bucks.The day this story took place was one such time: A company that had rented our conference rooms before had booked them again, but this time for a completely different occasion, hence other guests in our house.

Regarding technical equipment and support the rules were simple: We as the host provide you with one high quality projector per room, one HDMI cable, one audio cable if you want to use the room's speaker system, and one wifi voucher for each of the devices people need to present from. Everything other than that is your own business as a guest.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year's autumn, when this happened, both the IT team and our facility department ^((not sure if that's the correct term, not a native speaker - the department who janitors, catering staff etc belong to)) were very short on staff thanks to a bad stomach flu going around. Preparing the conference rooms for renters hasn't been of my duties for years anymore, but due to the staff situation and still knowing how to do it, I helped out. Usually our main janitor prepares the room layout and our internal catering woman stays on standby for the guests, but both were sick. The only option to fill in their positions on short notice was to borrow Lucy, an apprentice from another department. She was fresh from school, had only started her apprenticeship a few weeks ago and didn't mind doing something completely different for a day. Naturally she needed instructing and some help with her newly assigned duties. It took longer than usual, but together we made sure everything is perfectly prepared in time for our guests. Prior to their arrival I had briefed her to call me personally if the guests require any IT help before I had to leave.

Since I passed the conference area on the way through the building a little later on, I checked on Lucy and the guests. Quite a few had already arrived, but everything so far was good, projector and sound worked, she felt comfortable to handle the job, everything fine.

Half an hour passes by, then I receive a first call from Lucy. The guests wanted to know where they could get wifi vouchers. Dang, my bad, forgot to tell her. I sent her to the front desk to fetch one per device the guests need for their presentations.

Ten more minutes pass. Suddenly another call.

&gt;Lucy, sounding strangely nervous: *""Could you please come down? The guests need help with the wifi...""*

Since I'd never interacted with her before today, I couldn't quite place if the tone of her voice indicated a problem, or if she was just a little insecure and stressed now... Something felt off, though.

&gt;Me: *""Sure, don't worry, I'll be there in a few minutes, just gotta finish something real quick.""*

Upon entering the hallway to the conference rooms I could already hear an irritated woman's voice heavily berating somebody. Not a good sign. Worried now, I picked up my pace and turned around the final corner, only to find poor little Lucy cornered by a suited woman in her 40s whose voice I had heard, absolutely barking at her about not delivering what they paid for. Lucy was visibly shaking a little, probably getting close to a panic attack. After hearing my footsteps her eyes immediately made contact with mine, looking anxiously for help.

&gt;Me, sharply: *""Excuse me!""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman: ""***WHAT?*** *Now who the* ***f\*\*\**** *are you?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""I'm from IT and here to help you with the wifi issue Lucy has contacted me about. What can I do for you?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman, still in a very angry tone: *""We were promised wifi vouchers in the lease contract for the room, but* ***SHE*** *-""* pointing her finger directly at Lucy, almost stabbing her in the eye - *""refuses to hand out any!""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lucy, seemingly at the verge of tears now: *""But I... I gave you one for your laptop, your tablet and your guest speaker's laptop...""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman, shouting down on Lucy again: *""AND WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS? We have over 100 people here and EVERYONE needs wifi, you* ***stupid worthless \*\*\*\*****!""*

Those words really hurt and this new, unexpected toxic situation became too much to bear - tears welled up in Lucy's eyes. Before seeing this I already had more than enough of this woman's behavior, but now I snapped. This had to stop.

&gt;Me: ""***HEY! STOP.*** *Calm down. Keep those insults to yourself, where are your manners?! Back off of her, she's just doing her job and following policy!""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman, turning to me, cocky look on her face and maximum disdain in her voice: *""Who do you think you are, telling me what to say or do, huh? And what stupid policy?! We were promised wifi, and that's what we're getting from you.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""The contract clearly states the IT policy for external guests, which -""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman, cutting me off: *""****DON'T. CARE.*** *You two drones are utterly useless and should get* ***fired!*** *Get me the manager in charge,* ***NOW!****""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""Alright. As you wish. Be right back.""*

With that the woman stormed off, back into the conference room. I gestured Lucy to come with me and she immediately followed, glad to get away and barely keeping it together. We made our way around the corner, back to the elevators, when I stopped and put my hand on one of Lucy's shoulders, getting her to look up at me.

&gt;Me: *""I'm so sorry you were treated like that. Are you OK?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lucy nodded and took a deep breath, slowly regaining her composure.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me, continuing walking with her: *""Listen, you don't have to accept this sort of behavior, neither as an apprentice nor as anyone else. Feel free to simply walk away next time and report to a manager.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lucy: *""OK. I will.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""Don't let those hurtful words get to you - forget everything she said, you were doing a great job. Really, I mean it, and am very proud of you standing your ground.""*

We reached the elevators and entered one. I pushed the button to the executive floor.

&gt;Lucy: *""Where are we going now?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""My office. At least, I will. You go fetch a cup of hot chocolate or whatever you like from the machine next to the elevators, it's free. Have a seat on the sofa then. I'll be back in a few minutes.""*

Lucy looked confused, but complied. Meanwhile I went through the adjacent hallway door - and into my office. Since I knew in advance I'd help get the conference room ready due to filling in for the missing sysadmin in my team, but had an important meeting in the afternoon, I had changed from my slacks into jeans (which I keep in my wardrobe for such occasions) earlier and left my suit jacket and tie by my desk. Now I reverted those changes, made a few quick phone calls and returned to Lucy all dressed up. Her eyes grew wide.

&gt;Lucy: *""This question might sound stupid now, sorry, but... who are you exactly?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me, smiling: *""I do work in IT, but I am the CIO. Since so many of my people are sick right now I'm filling in for them. That's why I helped you set up the room instead of Ben, who'd usually do this. And now, since that lovely woman down there asked for management attention, we'll teach her a lesson in respect. Follow me.""*

With that we made our way down to the conference rooms again.

&gt;Me, mockingly straighting my tie and suit jacket: *""Lucy, would you* ***please*** *be so kind to inform our guest that the manager in charge is here now?""*

She grinned and did as requested. Immediately I could hear a faint *""Finally, everything takes too damn long around here!""* before the woman hurried through the door towards me. When she recognized me, she froze in her tracks.

&gt;Me: *""Good morning. My name is &lt;roflcopter-pilot&gt;, I'm the CIO of &lt;company&gt; and therefore the manager in charge regarding your issue, who you demanded to speak.""*

Calmly I walked towards her, reached into my jacket and gave her my business card. The woman took it, but not being able to throw anybody under the bus apparently left her without a plan and speechless.

&gt;Me: *""Now that I got your attention, I have three things to tell you.*  
*One: You stated that you 'were promised wifi' and that you 'want to get what you pay for'. You signed a contract stating that you get wifi access for every device needed for your presentations, which we delivered. We neither can nor will provide access for all attendees of your event. Our network, our rules. Period.*  
*Two: Your condescending, rude tone is bad enough in itself, but verbally abusing and intimidating employees, especially* ***a minor like in this case***, *absolutely won't be tolerated around here! I expect a sincere apology of yours to Lucy and myself.""*

She slowly found the ability to speak again.

&gt;Woman: *""OK, I apologize, that was not very professional of me. But -""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me, interrupting her: *""That's a massive understatement and doesn't sound terribly sincere to me. Furthermore, point three: Verbal assault and intimidation are against our house rules, which we strictly enforce and you agreed to adhere to by signing the rental contract. This alone warrants your personal removal from our premises. Also you apparently invited more than 100 people, which you weren't allowed to do and violates fire code rules, since the maximum room capacity is exactly 100, as stated in the contract. Due to now multiple breaches of contract and said fire code violations I herewith have to ask you and your guests to leave. By the way, according to internal consultation we have not the* ***slightest*** *further interest in renting out our rooms to your company, considering the circumstances. Please gather your people, personal belongings and then leave our premises.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short from here on:

She of course threw a massive hissy fit, questioned my authority some more and needed to be guided out by security. The other people from her company were confused and understandably not amused, but cooperated in a civil manner.

A week later she had her lawyer send us a letter claiming unfair treatment and requesting a refund, which gave our lawyer a big laugh and the opportunity to lay out to their counterpart how they breached the contract in great detail. That was the last we heard from them, thankfully.

The curious tale of dead CMOS battery and Dell Defaults,"Just a quicky

The local water district had a power outage and the venerable DELL windows 7 machine which does all their quickbooks and billing and such is in a reboot cycle.  I get called in .. being the local geek.  Also I help with the pump computers at the plant from time to time.  This is small time rural stuff.. no IT staff.. no budget

So WTF?  I boot the comp and the date is wrong.  OK .. drive the freaking 20 miles to get a cmos battery load it up.. change the date .. click 'default' settings in the bios ... thinking (like an idiot) that the default settings would be fine to get started on a factory made DELL machine.

Still won't get out of the loop.  I go into advanced recovery mode.. nowt.  I do the hardware checks.. NOWT

I run the full disk check (went to bed and got up) no problemo it says.

WTF!

So thankfully they have an image from last weeks backup (which I made them start doing).  I load a dos prompt.. copy all the files I can find as another backup and re-image the sucker from the backup thinking. OK whatever corruption is on this thing this should work.. does it??

NOPE!

Well fuck.  Then I think.. you idiot.. the only variable here is the BIOS being reset.  I go into the bios .. which is a freaking UI from hell.. no simple old school bios, but expandable links and mouse etc.  I see RAID enabled.  For a single drive simple basic one drive almost 10 year old computer.  I change it from RAID AHCI  to regular AHCI 

the bios bitches at me 'CHANGING THIS VALUE MAY REQUIRE YOU TO RE-INSTALL YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM'.  Well fine with me.. already did that.

Damn thing works right out of the box .. boots up fine.. I recover some files from my manual backup and off it goes.

GRR.. the 'default safe' CMOS settings on this DELL fubared me.  Why did I trust the safe settings? 

Cos i'm an idiot ;)

that's it.

edit: I've come to think that (thanks to u/bootleg_contoso) someone in the distant past installed windows using a the non raid AHCI setting in bios and thus the default didn't work.  So Maybe not Dells fault.. still frustrating :)",144,0,1
Marketing didn't get their way AKA The Day The Earth Stood Still,"Long story short.

Big company ($500M+) part of bigger ($50B) corporation. The first ten plus years I was there we had to help everyone in the company with any technology question they had.

* Don't know how to use your company smart phone? We'll help you figure it out.
* You need to work from home and can't get your laptop to connect to your Wi-Fi?  Sure, we'll waste hours because you keep trying to connect to the neighbor's Wi-Fi instead of your own.
* Quality department guy designs an unscalable and invisible to IT application in Microsoft Access and then moves to a new department?  IT suddenly has to support his work.

Around 2010 there was a big change in corporate leadership.  Word came down that local IT groups are **FORBIDDEN** from supporting any technologies not in the approved corporate IT portfolio.

* Someone comes with a smart phone problem?  Send them to the carrier.
* Someone has problems with their home Wi-Fi. Nope, as long as your laptop connects when plugged into the router/modem the rest is on you.
* You brought in a spare printer from home to hook up to your PC so you don't have to walk across the hall?  Hell no.

Marketing guy gets money approved in his budget for some iPad based app and does an end run on getting approval from local or corporate IT. *added* Marketing got the PO cut, paid the bill and did not go through the formal process of getting their tech project approved through IT channels.  

The app is some graphical product configurator and did not tie into our core business systems.  Any integration was sneaker-ware (manual entry).  The users were internal sales reps and our third party dealers, aka, our problem children.  Marketing and sales launched the new app and we started getting calls. I went to our VP and this conversation ensued.

* **Me** \- We've started getting calls about ""unapproved app"" and I don't have anyone that knows about it.  Should we contact the vendor to get cross trained?
* **VP** \- Under no circumstances are you to assist users with unapproved app. Send them all to marketing guy who did the end run.
* **Me** \- He won't like it and the sales reps won't like it. They will complain to their VPs and their VPs will bring it up in senior staff.
* **VP** \- I don't care and I'll take care of their VPs.

&amp;#x200B;

Two days later -

**VP** (to me) - Draft an email to all of sales and marketing.  Any and all support calls, questions or inquiries concerning unapproved app are to be directed toward marketing guy that did the end run. Tell them not to log any tickets to the IT HelpDesk either.  They need to go directly to marketing guy. He knows.  He's been told and anyone that complains about it needs to be sent to me.

Pressing the send button on that email - glorious.

Passing cocky marketing guy in the hall and seeing him give me the stink eye while I smile back at him - priceless!",557,0,1
The Lucky Buckeye – Part 1,"A story from “back in the day,” the day in question was when Novell was king. I was working for a small VAN in a medium sized city. We had an overflow contract with the local school district.

One of my first school district projects was to replace a Novell 3x server with a bright shiny new 5x server. The server was housed in what we used to call the Library, but now is referred to as the Media Center.  After spending the best part of two days with the friendly Media Specialist (AKA  Librarian) she rewarded me for my efforts with a Buckeye which she claimed was lucky. For the uninitiated, a Buckeye is a nut. I promptly thanked her and put it in my pocket.

Back at the office I noticed our Lotus Notes Developer (yes that far back in the day) walking between his office and the server room, many times in fact. This drew my curiosity so I went into the server room to look. On a whim, I pulled the Buckeye out of my pocket and tapped it on his server.

Queue the conversation on his last trip from the server room.

Me – Well, me.

LND – Lotus notes developer

LND: I fixed it!

Me: No you did not.

LND: I did.

\------ Repeat a couple of times -----

Me: No you did not, I tapped it with my lucky buckeye and that fixed it.

LND – No answer, just a look of puzzlement on his face as he wanders off to his office.

This lucky Buckeye is going to be FUN!

Idiots and iPads,"I work for a rather well known optician company, based in Paris.

Right now, we're deploying an iPad-based ""smart mirror"". Basically, you take a picture of a prospective client with it, and a special app lets you show them how they'd look with different kinds of glasses. It also performs other functions. 

All in all, a neat tool, and according to the feedback it's provided a significant increase in sales. 

But. We, that is, the IT team, perform the initial configuration. We set them up carefully to work properly, including enrollment, app setup, etc. Takes about an hour, then we send them off through a transporter to the different shops that are part of the test sample.

Except that for some reason, they decide they want to change the password. Invariably, a few days later they mess up the password and freeze the iPad. And of course instead of asking for help, they follow the procedure to reset the iPad, thus erasing the setup.

So it needs to come back at our main office, where we will set it back up properly. It takes around three or four days usually, with the back and forth through the transporter.


It's happened something like five times in a month, with a sample size of twenty. Let's just say I'm not optimistic regarding the full deployment of this ""toy"". Oh, and a shop managed to lock theirs not once but twice now. And of course I'm the tech with the most experience and usual referent for this project...

Edit because everyone asks about it : there is an MDM in place, but for whatever fucking reason it doesn't redeploy the configuration when users fuck it up.",1546,0,1
"I know, I installed it.","I've worked in IT for almost 25 years and now am considered a global expert in my specialty. I’m one of the people who made sure that anything on the internet was permanent and had a hand in building a major cloud service.

In the early 2000’s I was already considered an expert and was asked by my employer to present about a product at a bank who had just purchased it. I was part of a team with two other guys, each of us was going to give a technical presentation to the IT department. The first guy had been talking for about five minutes when someone entered the room and things started going downhill. He was heckling us.

“Well, when I was at &lt;insert major retailer&gt;, we had problems with that and blah, blah, blah.”

The guy had the most annoying, nasal, snide voice, just dripping with “I’m going to blather on about how smart I am by putting you down.” GOD, I wanted to punch him, but even worse I had to do my presentation in front of him. Maybe he’d stop after the first guy was finished.

Oh no he didn’t.

The next guy got up, talking about a different but related product and its technical features, and he laid into him, “Well, &lt;insert major retailer&gt; had so much trouble with iSCSI that we had to blah, blah, blah.”

Oh wonderful.

What I \*didn’t\* notice was how the other people in the room were reacting to him. He was getting the side-eye, ESADMF looks, and blatant glares from all the IT guys there. In retrospect, why the manager there didn’t shut him up is still a mystery.

So when my turn came, I decided just to plow through things and endure him. I started talking about my product and sure enough, he HAD to say something.

“Well, at &lt;insert major retailer&gt; we had one of these and it gave us a LOT of trouble with authenticating into Windows domain servers,” This was before Active Directory came out, not relevant to the story but it gives the tech folks of an idea when.

I stood there and listened to him, just nodding along, I can field this one, no sweat.

“I know, I installed it.”

DEAD SILENCE.

“The OS was about 3.2 or 3.3, I think,” I went on, not realizing what had happened, “Now we’re on version 6 and, if I remember right, it was a Windows authentication issue and worked perfectly after a patch.”

Two seconds later it hit me. Oh CRAP! I just shut down the client! But I continued on with my presentation and he left shortly afterwards, before I finished.

All the IT guys came up and apologized, telling me he’d just come over from &lt;insert major retailer&gt; and couldn’t stop talking about how they did things and why it was better. One guy said he was an ass and they couldn’t stand him.

Outside the bank, everyone was laughing and congratulating me for shutting him down, saying he’d stepped in it and stepped in it GOOD. We were almost at lunch when we met the sales guy, who had been on the phone, and the first thing he asked was, “Who’s Joe (not my name)?”

“Me,” I replied, not certain how this was going to go but he shook my hand.

“That was freaking BRILLIANT! I was so mad at that jerk and when you shut him down I jumped up and started punching at the phone yelling, YES! YES! YES! Take THAT arsehole!”

I’ve told that story over and over since, it never gets old and NEVER has happened again. I honestly don’t want it to, I’m a professional that takes great pride in my work and he was the total opposite of one. It speaks volumes of their hiring practices that let someone like that get through.",2365,0,1
Your software proved our tax fraud so we want a refund.,"This  customer was a small local hotel. I have no idea why they were being investigated, because they were small and not making a ton of money. We got a call from the IRS wanting us to assist them in gaining access to the software and printing out some reports. We bill them for a few hours of work and then get started.

I provided them with the default user and password that comes with the demo. It's a long shot but sometimes customers don't follow our instructions to delete it. The hotel never changed the credentials and the default demo user works. That was easy so let's get to the reports. I direct them to a few reports to print out to obtain revenue info for the approximately 3 years the customer had used our software. After I spent some time explaining how to read the reports and how to print variations of them with different  date ranges, sorting, etc., I was done. All this took less than an hour and they told us to keep the balance of what they paid as a credit in case they need to call back, which they never did. Easy money.

A couple months go by and one of the owners of this hotel calls and wants to discuss a refund for the software because it cost them tens of thousands of dollars. It turns out she was referring to the taxes and fines she had to pay because she'd been lying to the IRS for years about their income. We politely declined but she insisted saying that she really needs the money now to pay her taxes and it's sort of our fault that she's in this situation now. I feel her pain because the IRS can be a harsh mistress, but our software did its job for 3 years and there won't be any refund coming. I'm still shocked that the IRS went after them because it wasn't that much money for a hotel over at least the 3 years they used our software.",823,0,1
Whatever You Just Did Undo It,"It's a bit long, so tl;dr at the bottom

This story comes from about 8 years ago when I was working at my very first IT job at a small shop in the greater Chicagoland area. Despite its size, we somehow managed to do a lot of subcontracting work for very large corporations. I mostly serviced the suburbs, but occasionally had to work downtown, which I loathed due to the traffic, how long it took to get reimbursed for travel expenses, and it typically meant I would be late for my evening college classes. 

This particular call came in at 4:30 p.m. on a Friday and they wanted a technician to show up **now**, which meant that they were paying weekend and emergency response rates for me to show up. The kicker for me was that I was an abused salary employee making $25,000 a year and often working 60 hours a week with travel time, so calls like this really stung. The place was just one street away from the lake type of downtown, and the problem? The manager was unable to record their ""soup of the day"" greeting on their phone system.

I ground through traffic to eventually arrive to a very worked up manager and an Avaya voicemail card for me to install. He explained how and why he needed the card to be configured, and left me to set it up while he darted all about the place. I configured it, and then called my boss to make sure that I had done it correctly (also, if I was working on a Friday afternoon I was dragging him into it). I then hunted down the manager to show him how to work it and closeout.

I'm showing him how it works and it's something like:

Me: ""So it's pretty easy, you will just need to press this button then this button, record the message, then hit this button, and BAM! That's it you are good to go."" I finish by hitting him with a very pleased, I just drove 2 1/2 hours, please, please sign off on this ticket type of customer service smile.

Customer: ""Wait, so you are telling me that I have to record the greeting EVERY single morning when I come into work?!!""

Me with that feeling of dread sinking in: ""Well yes, if you want a different greeting every day with the soup special of the day you would have to record a different message every day.""

Customer: ""That's completely unacceptable! I can't waste precious time every morning doing that!""

Me: ""Oh my... Umm... maybe perhaps you could just record one message that says what the soup special is each day of the week and leave that as the permanent greeting as a solution?""

Customer: ""No, our specials change every week. I tell you what, whatever you just did, undo it.""

I attempt to persuade him to change his mind by again showing him how easy it is to do and give him a little cheat sheet on the process, but to no avail. I was totally shocked when he signed off on the service ticket that outlined the hours and charges, a rather large expense just for the work to immediately be undone. I left the voicemail card with instructions on how to re-insert it to restore its functionality. I took my signed service ticket and dashed out of there before he could change his mind. 

I still chuckle about the urgent ""You need to show up NOW"" that changed to that ""Whatever you just did, undo it,"" and the amount of money that was spent on that.

Customer wastes HUGE amount of $ for a 1 minute fix.,"I am stunned right now! In order to make sure this stays anonymous, I'm going to be as vague as possible while still getting the point across...

I work for a company that manufactures things. We make big complicated things that require trained professionals to service, in addition to simpler things that any literate human with opposable thumbs (or a reasonably good mechanical facsimile) can handle.

So I get a call from one of our very experienced technicians. They've been dispatched to change a setting on one of the simpler devices we make. Literally, that's it. This company paid nearly $2000USD (it cost extra for getting it done right away - this customer wanted this very unimportant setting changed immediately!) for this service that was about as difficult to do as changing the channel on a TV when you've lost the remote and you gotta do it using the hidden buttons - but these buttons weren't even hidden! Service calls are billed at a minimum of 4 hours, plus driving time. This setting takes 1 minute maximum to change - if you're doing it for the first time. Maybe 10 seconds if you're experienced.

Then, it turns out the tech didn't actually know how to do it! Now I know they hardly ever work on these units since they are so simple, but the units all have these handy little things called 'user manuals' (trying to make air quotes here) online, for just any old person to use to look shit up. 

So yeah, I'm just a bit shocked right now at the capricious waste of money being spent by a company whose sole purpose for existing is to manage money for their clients while also being stunned by the fact that little ol' me needed to be called to figure out how to do it.",1636,0,1
"""Pay me for my time with your COVID money!""","I posted here once before, but for a little background, I am the manager of a small college's IT helpdesk, consisting of me and 5 student employees that report to me. I've told my student workers in the past that if they experience any alarming vitriol from their client, to transfer the call to me to handle. They don't get paid nearly enough to sit around and listen to ignorant people calling them names, so I am a very protective mama bear when it comes to the way they are treated.

That being said, I recently hired a new student worker, one who is pretty well versed in IT concepts (at least well enough to handle tier-1 tech support on a college campus). I was out of the office for a minute getting lunch, so he attempted to handle a rather... heated client, a parent whose daughter was attending online class with the school. I returned, and he described the call to me, so I just had to share here... We'll refer to the student worker as **SW** and this client as **AP**, or ""Arrogant Parent"".

&gt;**SW:** Thank you for calling \[college's IT department\], this is SW, how can I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** Hi, yes, my daughter is attending an online class and can't see the board. Can you fix that?  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** I'm sorry, just to clarify - what kind of issue is she experiencing when trying to view the lecture? Is the feed cutting out?  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** No, nothing like that, there's a glare on the board, so she and the other students can't see what's being written on the board.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** Well, it doesn't sound like that would be something we would handle, as it sounds like a lighting issue specific to the professor's setup. Has your daughter asked the professor to make changes to the setup to accommodate students?  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** This is obviously an IT issue, that's why I called the IT helpdesk. You need to send someone over to the classroom to move the camera.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** I understand, ma'am, and I can certainly look into this for you. Can I get the professor's name and the room number of the class?  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** Can't you just look it up?  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** I can't look up anything without knowing who the professor is...  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** I don't know, it's something that starts with S.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** Ma'am, I need to know the full last name of the professor. There are several individuals teaching at \[college\] whose name begins with S, so if I were to look up the information you've provided me, we would be here all day and the issue would not be resolved.  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** *(long, exasperated huff, speaking away from the phone to the daughter)* Can you give me the name of this professor because this guy obviously doesn't know how to look up a name.

My student worker was reasonably getting irritated at this point, but he maintained his composure. Eventually, she gave him the name, which was a *hilariously* complex name that he would have never guessed in a million years! She was, however, unable to provide a room number.

&gt;**SW:** Alright, so what I can do here is send an email to the professor on your daughter's behalf, letting him know that his current streaming setup is causing students issues in being able to view the board. I can let him know that if he's having any issues with the setup, that we can send a technician out to his classroom to assist, as he would be able to provide us with the room number.  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** That isn't good enough. You need to send someone out there right now. I'm sure that it's those ridiculous smart boards that are causing the problem, making it difficult to actually read anything going on. Here, I've got a suggestion for you. Why don't you take that COVID money you've leeched from the government and use it to buy blackboards. Those are reliable.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** I'll make sure someone is aware of your feedback. Unfortunately, as you do not know the building or room number, I'm unable to dispatch a technician to the location. I can certainly send that email out, though, to see if there is anything that can be done. In the meantime, I recommend that your daughter reach out to the professor as well, as this may allow for a more immediate resolution. Is there anything else I can help you with today, ma'am?  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** Yeah, listen. Your school oughta be paying *me* some of that COVID money since I'm putting in the work that you aren't! At least that way I know it's going to good use.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** I understand. Will that be all for you today, ma'am?  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** *(click)*

Part of me hopes that this individual was just joking around, but as I didn't field the call, I only have my new hire's word to go on. This is largely paraphrased based on what he told me, but he later went on to describe that her tone was very aggressive and hostile from the beginning of the call. We still don't know why she called IT instead of having her daughter send a message in the Teams chat to her professor in the first place...",693,0,1
Ignorance is bliss.,"Obligatory not actually in IT - just a somewhat competent teenager who gets drafted to fix family tech problems.

For this story, we'll be going about six months back. Me and my sister are deep in the terrifying clutches of Wuhan-flu-induced online ""learning"", desperately trying to keep ahead of the constant stream of mind-numbing busy work. I'm almost done with a history assignment when I get a Discord ping.

    Sister: whnng
            my chargers not worKING
            help
    Me:     *How* is it not working?
    Sister: i dunno
            its plugged in
            but will not charge
            cmere
    Me:     fine -_-

I head down the hallway and into her room. Her laptop is jacked in, but sure enough, the battery indicator helpfully tells me that it's not charging. I follow the cord up to the power brick and check its LED - bright green. Power *should* be flowing. I pick up the laptop and try a few tricks, but no dice. It must be a hardware problem.

I pull the plug out of its port and eyeball them. It's a simple one-pin circular design, and nothing seems to be bent or missing on either end. I try aggressively re-seating it a few times to no avail. I'm in the middle of spinning it around when I begin to notice several things.

1. Her laptop is hot. Like, almost painfully hot. And the fan is clearly working overtime.
2. The bottom feels just a bit uneven, like the left side is thicker than the right.
3. The entire bottom-left corner of the keyboard is covered in a mess of Scotch tape.

""What's with the tape?"" I ask.

""The keyboard was coming loose.""

Big red flag. I'm fairly certain that laptop keyboards don't just up and separate under normal circumstances unless you're either extremely violent or extremely cheap. Concerned, I rip off the tape, and *the bottom-left of the keyboard plate and chassis have completely separated.* I can just barely see the corner of the main board inside, and the ports on the side have been partially occluded from shifting behind the chassis bezel. 

""Did it ever occur to you that this might not be normal?"" I said.

""Yeah, but I just taped it up."" Fair enough, it wasn't the most premium piece of hardware ($500 Dell, plastic build, not terrible but not great) and she could have thought something just popped.

I don't think it's that. I fish out the model ID from the number spaghetti on the bottom sticker and look up a teardown. Sure enough, the battery is located towards the bottom left. Just to be sure, I gently pry open the gap with my fingers and shine my phone flashlight inside - and *yep the battery is looking like a whole pillow.*

""Yeahhh... you don't have anything important on here, do you?""

""No, why?""

""Because the reason it wasn't charging was because the battery was about to blow and burn this entire fucking room down.""

""Oh.""

Long story short, the machine was immediately shut down and relocated to an isolated garage shelf next to the fire extinguisher, where I believe it continues to sit to this day, pending a means to dump it without inadvertently igniting a garbage truck. We're lucky it stopped charging when it did - she leaves it to charge on carpeted ground in a fairly messy room. You can extrapolate out the rest.

Moral of the story? Ignorance is bliss, until you get unlucky and wake up at three A.M. in a lithium fire hellscape.",241,0,1
My dog ate my internet.,"So, one day working internet tech support, I get a call from a gentleman whose internet is out. Somewhat interestingly, he lived on the very outskirts of our service area, a subdivision that was just being built. He was one of our first customers in that area (he may have actually been our first and only in that area at the time, it's been a while for me now.)


So the physical cable pedestal (that green box, usually somewhere around one foot square at the base, three feet high or so, there's about one on every block in a more populated area) was actually located inside his backyard, for some reason, I assume some kind of easement.


Before I even started troubleshooting, he told me he was sure the problem was because his dog damaged the pedestal. The obvious symptoms (lights on the cable modem and my tools) backed up that he wasn't getting a signal, but, I mean, a pedestal is a metal box with very little in the way of exposed parts. But, maybe his dog dug down near it and got a buried cable. Ok, sure, we send a tech out.


Now, I very rarely have direct contact with on-site techs, and those are only when I call them. But, a week or two later, I checked into this to see how it went (standard procedure for me with interesting calls, curiosity not procedure) I found the most copious notes ever made by a tech, he knew everyone was going to dispute this if he didn't do so. I'll quote from memory as best as I can.


*""Pedestal was eaten by dog. Yes, eaten. Half the pedestal is missing, insides and outsides. Remaining pedestal has clear bite marks and chunks clearly bitten off. I cannot find most of the pieces that are missing. Dog is as tall as me and twice my weight. Owner called it a wolfhound. He is very friendly, but do not replace this pedestal in customer's backyard, this dog can and will eat it again.""*


Narrator: They. Did. Not. Listen.


The pedestal was eventually replaced, in the same spot. This happened a second time. Notes this time were more along the lines of ""Dog ate pedestal again. Escalating to (some higher person I don't know). WE WILL NEED TO MOVE THIS PEDESTAL""


No notes after that. I gotta assume that it was unbelievable once but not twice.",973,0,1
Turning one man’s week into another man’s hour and a half.,"Obligatory happened a couple of years ago, not in IT but into computers, and this is bit of a long one.

So, I started a new job, having just left one I’d spent automating as much as I could and moved into a team with some great guys and a really SupportiveManager (SM). My colleagues (mostly) knew their stuff, were all up for automating things and making things easier and were helpful in teaching me stuff I didn’t know.

I say mostly, because I was taking over from someone I will refer to as FashionBoy (FB). FB wasn’t too bad to begin with, a little odd in his own way but just kinda plodded along with the job. He taught me the basics and I got to work. This is when the warnings started to come in, people telling me how awkward he was and to be careful.

He was using basic macros that other people had written in Excel, and I started digging into them a bit and learning how they worked. Digging through the VBA scripts I started trying to clean up a lot of the code, trying to speed it up a little bit more than anything while still doing the new job. When recording macros in Excel there tends to be a lot of scrolling that goes on that can just be deleted – so it was just getting rid of a lot of this really alongside some other inefficiencies I was tidying.

All in all – I probably cut it down to about 2/3s of the time, maybe half (they were really messy).

Now he’d only got about 4 macros or so, but I could see there was a lot more he’d previously been doing himself that could be cut down to a macro. A lot of exporting data from the system – cutting and pasting columns, sorting data, deleting things etc. When I could just run a macro to sort it all, delete anything I didn’t need, copy it, and then all I had to do was paste it into the right place. I started recording some macros of my own and tweaking them afterwards to make them more efficient.

It was at this point FB asked me what I was doing (VBA script clearly not being part of the job description). After a little hesitancy, I figured what the hell – he was using macros anyway, so who cared? I explained what I was doing and then “The Change” began.

Exactly what people had warned me about was revealed. He absolutely flipped, saying I didn’t know what I was doing, that I was messing with company processes and was going to break them, that he’d put these macros together for me (he hadn’t put them together, and certainly not for me) and I was ruining them.

In comes SM to save the day – pulls FB into a meeting room and basically tells him where to get off, didn’t even need to ask my side of the story. FB runs out crying, SM comes over to me and tells me to carry on – with the biggest grin on his face. He knew exactly what he was dealing with.
Super weird day – but FB kinda stayed away from me after that, only talking to me when he really needed to. What a blessing!

After a little while I found I’d be using these macros multiple times throughout the week – but for different tasks. I spoke to IT to switch a couple of reports around so I could use the same macro for multiple different reports, and it ended up saving me tonnes of time. So I’d ask for more work – and ended up taking more of FB’s stuff off him. Again, more things I’d automate with macros.

After this – SM found another job elsewhere, and before he left said “This team is far too big for the work there is, do what you can with it and keep your head down”. Oh and how right he was!

I ended up reporting to his OldBoss (OB) for a bit, then moved to a NewManager (NM) within the team. They just left me to do my thing, and had no complaints – as long as everything was getting done.

I ended up with about 10 macros that would do basically a day’s work in 15 mins. Every. Single. Day. Where FB was taking hours, my week was lasting all of about an hour and a half, split across the week. The frustrating thing was that he had the tools – he was even using them, but still didn’t do more with them.

I’d go to OB and NM but neither had the enthusiasm SM ever had to listen to me when I was trying to get more work from them. “Oh you’ve got enough to do, you’ve taken all of FB’s work after all!” and despite my protests, they wouldn’t give me more work (which was just insane). I asked other people if I could help them, but they got protective of what (seemingly little) work they had and wouldn’t accept help.

Unsurprisingly once the management changed, things started to go downhill. I asked if I could work at home (unofficially so that I could do other stuff) but the answer was a firm no. I was just bored – it was like prison - I’d automated myself out of a job and the management didn’t even care. So, I just started seeing how far I could push it. I’d go for walks for hours, listening to Podcasts, Audiobooks, or Music. I’d book myself meeting rooms and play Minesweeper. I’d set myself small challenges like “Can I go for a day without saying a word to anyone?” (this day included multiple meetings with people and data I had to run through – I still succeeded).

As much as I enjoyed my free time – I needed things to do. So, I used the time to get another job, I wrote up the details of what I did step by step, handed in my notice, distributed it out to the team, and left for something new (and a five figure pay rise).

OB couldn’t understand why I wanted to leave - last I heard, they’d just employed 3 new people to join the team.",1450,0,1
"Fix those e-mails, ASAP!","So  this happened on a web project we had for a government agency (because I  love working with them). Development had been completed for a good one  and a half year, and we were in a rather uneventful supporting phase,  until an error ticket arrived from the customer:""Notification e-mail not arriving on form submission. Fix it ASAP!""

A  little context: The site we developed was for a government program that  business owners could apply for. This is what 'The Form' was for. Upon  submitting The Form, the application information would be stored in the  system, and a notification email would be sent out to a set of  predefined addresses. Except that the e-mails stopped arriving. Although  these notifications weren't all that important, since the data were  accessible through their admin portal anyway, the customer was  adamant that we resolve this issue as fast as possible, so I got to  work.

I've checked if the  addresses were correctly set. They were. Then tried it out on our test  server with a test address. The e-mail arrived without an issue. I've  ran a few more rounds, trying to find the source of the problem, but to  no avail. I've concluded that the answer might lurk among the mail  server logs, so I handed the ticket over to the server management to  check the mail server logs. Now, the application is hosted on the  customer's server. We have access to it, but are not directly  responsible for its architecture. This'll be important.

A  few days go by, no news about the email problems, I'm pretty much  preoccupied with other projects, kinda forgot about this ticket already.  That is, until the following conversation took place with the project  manager (PM):

PM: Oh, by the way, we know what was wrong with the notification emails on the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ project.  
Me: Oh, really? What happened?  
PM: Well, it turns out the mail server that was responsible for sending out the notification emails doesn't exist anymore.  
Me: Oh wow  
PM: Wait, it gets better  
Me: ... yea?  
PM: It was shut down in November.  
Me: But... it's... July.  
PM: I know.  
Me: The ticket arrived less than a week ago.  
PM: I know.  
Me: They... said it's urgent.  
PM: \*sigh\*... I know.

The problem was quickly resolved after that. I still wonder to this day, just how urgent the problem could've possible been if it took them 8 months to realize that not a single notification email is arriving, despite new entries popping up on the admin portal.",1427,0,1
My TV doesnt work,"It's a fairly common occurence, really. I do install work for a local ISP, tv and internet. I also do service calls whenever I finish my to-do list.

I got a call out to a guy who was just Spitting mad. Cussed out the girls on the phone, whole 9 yards. Funky, our older service tech who normally took these calls, was out, so I was helping.

I arrive at their home, and walk in. Guy opens the door, and if looks could kill, I swear I'd be dead. Growls about how ""his service hasn't worked sense install, it's always broken, out company sucks, he wants a refund and hes gonna go look for another service, we can all ES&amp;D, we are the scum of the ear-
""Your TV was on the wrong input""

What? No, it cant be. That box is dead, it's bad service it-

.... Oh. Ok, thanks. Have a great day.




This is a surprisingly common occurrence, and normally people are a lot cooler and a lot more apologetic.

(Story over. Random info dump below)

 There are almost always 3 resolutions to this:

1. The cable box was hooked up wrong

Be it the cable input put on the output, the power not plugged in, or the video out not connected to anything. 

2: the cable box needs rebooted. 

Or, hit. We can remotely shoot a hit to the boxes, and we always ask for our office people to do it when they get a cable call, but never do they. We get out there, we ask them to hit it, it takes the hit, it works.

3: The box is dead, jim

 these old second- or third-hand boxes that we buy wholesale from /electronics company/ have been refurbished more times than years I've been alive. Sometimes they just die. We change them out and everything is fine. Super frustrating to deal with",196,0,1
Why the server room isn't an open access area...,"**I don't think I've posted this one...**


I'm in the server room, working on a new server that's going live sometime later this week. Just doing those little things that help a server work at it's best when it goes live....

Not buying the BS eh? I'm hiding, because I feel like someone beat me with a stick while I slept, and I don't deal well with some people when I hurt this bad. So, I'm hiding in the server room, at my little table, with my KVM bouncing between servers 'looking' for an issue. I've got my headphones on, an audiobook playing so I don't notice someone coming into the server room. 

My first hint that I am not alone is eyeballs between two servers, then I see someone's mouth moving in the form words usually force a mouth to make. I can't hear anything, so I go down to the end of the racks, turn the corner and find myself faced with a Manager.

&gt; Me: *Yelling* HI! You shouldn’t be in here!

&gt; Manager: I...*Yelling* I need you to talk to someone about an issue!

&gt; Me: *mouthing* No No.... (which unless you're a lip reader, apparently looks like you’re saying OK.) *then giving him a get out thumb*

He looks confused, grins, gives me a thumbs up and leaves the server room. I take out my phone, and I see there are no help tickets from this person, no emails directly from this person, and nothing from his manager.

I go back to my little workspace, and I am clearing out temp files on an old server that doesn't know how to tidy up itself. Then I notice one of the servers is off, one that shouldn't be off, I can see the fans sitting stationary. I hit it's KVM number, and it gives me no signal from the source, so I hit the ID button and head around front. I pull the face plate, and turn on the server, then head back around to the back. In the few seconds I take to move back around behind the rack, the server has shut back off. So I do the next thing on the list, unplug the power and push it out so I can pull the top panel to see what's wrong. As I push the server out of the rack, it hits something, I figure it's just the rack door swung partially closed, some of these racks do that.

When I go back around the racks with my trusty step stool, I see Manager laid out on the floor, bleeding from a gash on his forehead.

I drop the step stool and rush over, his eyes are open and he does appear to be breathing. 

&gt; Me: Are you alright?

I get no answer, he just looks at me and then back at the server sticking out of the rack. I stick my head out the door and tell whoever is in earshot to call HR and get the first aid kit.

Suddenly it's a party, everyone is gawking in through the windows to the server room. The HR guy see's the blood and calls 911, for an ambulance and the cops, in his defense there was a lot of blood on the guy's forehead. They are afraid to move him, and there is even some talk about turning off some of the noise. I just look at them like they are insane at that comment as I stand to the side and let the first aid trained HR guy handle the situation.

The EMS guys arrive, declare it's safe to move him and finally everyone is out of my server room. Then the cops arrive and have 100 questions, and I don't enjoy 99 of them. They lessen up the questions after I tell them it was all caught on camera, and they go off to HR to watch the replay. 

I explain that I think what happened was that the Manager came back in and was looking for me. Instead of looking behind the racks he was looking through them, and I just happened to catch him in the forehead with a server I was working on at the time. Then I had to explain how I didn't hit him with the server. He hit the server, it's not like I was watching to see someone get right at the correct spot before I pushed the server out of the rack. At this point, I'm certain most of the company thought I threw a server at the guy, or used it like a club to bludgeon him in the head. The cops come back by and tell me it appears to be a workplace accident, and thank me for my time. That works for me.

I log into the camera system, pull up the camera for the front rack area and scroll back a bit to see what happened. 

I see me come around to the front, open the door, turn on the server and then head back to my workspace. The Manager comes back in the server room, and leaned over looking through the server racks. I apparently had just gone behind the racks when he came in the door, because he looks through all the racks until he gets to the open door. He leans over, I see the server start to slide out, he hears or senses the movement, looks up straight into the server.

I replay that bit a few times, it looks like he did it on purpose, but I've been told it's not safe to leave this guy out in the rain, if you know what I mean. I guess he knows why we don’t let everyone into the server room now.

That time I gave Texas style brisket dry rub instructions in between instructions on how to test a flickering screen.,"Got a call a week or so ago regarding a flickering screen. 

&gt; $Me - Thanks for calling IT this is Me, how is your day going?  
&gt; $Her - Its fine, and you?  
&gt; $Me - So far terrible, how can I help?

&gt; $Me - Funky like platform shoes complete with goldfish inside of them? Or funky like its acting weird.   
&gt; $Her - *Laughs* Its flickering and flashing strange colors.   

Suddenly I hear her someone else in the background. Its another woman asking what her husband wants prepared for the dry rub on the brisket. There is some back and forth until I hear this. 

&gt; $Her - Well I may have to call him and ruin the surprise. I have no clue how he likes it.   
&gt; $Me - I personally prefer to mix my own dry rub.   
&gt; $Her - Oh? What do you use.   
&gt; $Me - 1/3rd cup of brown sugar, 3 table spoons of paprika, 3 TBL spoons of kosher salt, 2 TBL spoons of garlic powder, 2 TBL spoons of onion powder, 1 TBL spoon of black pepper freshly ground if possible, 1 TBL spoon of dried parsely, 1 Tsp spoon of Cayenne Pepper, 2 TBL spoons of ground cumin, 1 TBL spoon of ground coriander, 1/4th TBL spoon of hot chili powder, 1 TBL spoon of dried oregano. 

&gt; $Me - Mix all of that and rub it into the meat very well before you smoke it. Make sure to really rub it into the meat.   
&gt; $Her - Oh wow thank you.  
&gt; $Me - YOU will also want to unplug the video cable from your non functioning monitor, wait about 10 seconds and plug it back in. Let me know if that fixed the issue.   
&gt; $Her - Oh... Ok. One moment. *One moment later* OK yeah that looks like it worked.

Since upgrading our network your software is terrible.,"This customer had been having a lot of issues that seemed to be network related so we recommended that they hire someone to check things out for them. A couple weeks of this happen and then calls start rolling in complaining that the software is running worse than ever and it now almost unusable. It's pretty obvious that the problem is related to the network so we recommend they have someone check it out again. The owner calls us pretty angry telling us that he had the network completely redone and that the problem is clearly with our software so we need to fix it. We have an application and network benchmark and when they run it the score is so low that it's just obvious the network is the issue. This place is just a couple hour drive away so the owner offers me a free night at his hotel, free dinner, and drinks, as well as paying our hourly rate, if I'll come look at it for him.

The owner isn't there when I get there and he never shows up either. The general manager is there and she shows me to the server room and I start to see what the problems are. There's no way the owner hired a professional. Their network switch was on top of a stack of boxes with cables tightly stretched and going off in several directions. This switch was under the AC vent in the ceiling and there was a very slow drip that was landing on the box the switch was on and was splashing on to it. The general manager confesses that the owner did this. He ran all new cables that he made from a kit be bought online. I guess he made the cables too short or just had no idea how run cable and this disaster was the result.

The general manager also asked me to look at the guest wifi since it stopped working as well. She shows me the access point and I ask her what the wires connected to the antenna plugs are (they lead to a jumbled mess and I can't see where they go). She tells me that the owner installed some really long antennas to give the wifi better range. Unable to locate anything that looks like an antenna, I ask her where the antennas are. She points to two white wires, each in a corner of this room going from about shoulder level to the ceiling. I take a closer look and these are just a cheap white 2 wire extension cord where the wires were separated. Yes, just a single wire being used for each antenna. 

I explain that I can't really do anything for them and the general manager understands. She isn't a tech person but when I start pointing things out to her she gets it. Obviously water and networking equipment don't mix. And she understands that using an extension cord wire in place of a properly tuned wifi antenna won't work. I eat my dinner and head back home.

What about these other cables?,"*user calls in asking about a receipt printer not working*

Me: what do the lights show on the printer?

Me: ( not in the mood to describe the power button) sure, what do you see on the back?

User: just an internet cable.

Me: that's it? No other cables (thinking I'm sure there's no way this is POE). Okay, just unplug it. Are the lights still on?

Call center woes,"So years ago I worked for a badly run call center.  Most of the people were good but the 'leaders' were horrible.

I was in IT as the developer.  One day we had to have an urgent meeting regarding site security.  I was told that every user was to be given Admin rights in the intranet immediately.

I said no, but out of curiosity what was the reason.  I was told that 'my rules' are too restrictive and that no one could do anything.

I explained to them that security was based on job position, and positions were given specific access to certain functionality within the system.   Could they explain further?

One person needed access to one specific function that their position should have afforded them, but was accidentally left out of the security.  In three seconds I added that piece to their position security and everything was good.

They seriously wanted me to give 300 employees admin access to every function in the system (including payroll and hr) just so one person could have one minor function.

But this made me look bad because I questioned authority by keeping security in the system.

&amp;#x200B;

Another great story was I was told (same job btw) to fix something relating to the credit card for a persons account.  I looked in the database and found that not just the credit card information was being stored, but also the CVV and expiry date as well, in plain text!  I freaked out and went to the 'leaders' and they said 'so what, we might need that one day'.  I said no, and in exactly 10 minutes I was going to remove all of that data and change the website to not even allow the saving of this info.

I was told not to do that under any circumstances.    I said having this information is illegal and must be removed.  Did you want to go to jail over this?  Will you sign an email telling me to leave unencrypted credit card information in the DB? (they wouldn't of course)

And this was the moment that the 'leaders' decided they didn't need an IT department anymore.

I left shortly after that but....

Last one, I promise.  So I have contact with the person who does IT in that company now and when agents started working from home we would set them up with a router and an ip-sec tunnel for security.  However, that costs too much so the guy who does it now has it set up with nothing but pptp.  To top it off they not only have access to customer information in our system, but information through the company they worked for as well.  Completely unsecured.",275,0,1
Why listen to your IT person if you just can do the exact opposite of what he says?,"Not too long ago one of our customers decided that they need to update their age old business software to a new version. Since they have their own ""specialized"" company that advises them when it comes to that software this meant that I had to do some co-op work. 

This story involves the following persons:

*Me* = responsible for managing the IT infrastructure of the customer

*Boss* = the boss of the company that is our customer

*Genius 1* = the dude from the specialized business software company who is responsible for our customer

*Genius 2* = the dude from the specialized business software company who isn't actually responsible for the case but is consulting Genius 1 since they both know that Genius 1 is absolutely clueless (spoiler: what they don't know is that Genius 2 is quite clueless as well)

So a few days before the date that was arranged for the update, Genius 2 calls me, asking me if the customer's server had a CD drive.

I tell him that it hasn't.

He responds ""Well but how can we install the update then? We'll have to update several versions and some of them are only available on CD!""

Me: ""Just copy the content of each CD into a folder on the network share. Or upload it in the web and download it. Or do an ISO of the CDs so that we can mount it. More or less everything would work...""

He: ""Ah, ok, yeah. I'll explain it to Genius 1.""

15 minutes later I receive a mail: ""Here's Genius 2 again. Do you happen to know if the customer might have an external CD drive that we could use?""

My reply: ""I think they have. You could use it from one of their workstations to upload the content of the CD to the network drive if you like. But don't hook it directly to the server. It won't work. That's virtual machines.""

His reply: ""Ok, please make sure that they have an external CD drive and confirm it to me.""

So I call the customer (Boss), let them confirm that they have an external CD drive and tell them that it could be used to copy the contents of the CDs via a workstation to the network drive if  - for whatever reason - Genius 1 or 2 can't provide the data as a download themselves. I also told the customer that he shouldn't hook the CD drive to the server because it won't work.

Two days later the ""Boss"" calls me: ""Hey, I just plugged the external CD drive to the server but it doesn't show up!"" \[he means: it doesn't show up in the virtual server\]

Me: ""Mmmmmh... okay? But why did you do that? Didn't I tell you two days ago not to hook the drive to the server?""

Boss: ""Well, Genius 1 told me to do it.""

So I explained to the boss - again - that it doesn't work and what he should do instead. He agreed to do so this time.

The next day Genius 1 called me to confirm some information that he needs to access the server that I gave him long ago. I used the opportunity to ask him why he tells the boss to do things of which I explained before why they shouldn't be done:

Me: ""Didn't Genius 2 explain to you why hooking up the CD drive to the server won't work and is unnecessary anyway? I told him what you could do instead.""

Genius 1: ""Yeah but you don't understand... those updates for the older versions... they are only available on CD! We can't download them from the vendors website!""

Me: ""I understand this very well, that's why I explained to you guys how you can get that data from the CD to the server!""

Genius 1: ""Yes I understand that the server has no CD drive... that's why we asked if there is an external CD drive available!""

Me: ""... well ... anyway ... the Boss has copied the data from each CD into a folder on the network share for you in the meantime. If you access the server you'll find it at location xy""

Genius 1: ""In a folder? But how can I open the CD from a folder?""

More and more doubting if I'm awake I then did a remote session together with Genius 1 to show him, how he can double click an EXE file inside a folder in order to launch the installer... he finally seemed to understand and I started to ask myself if it's a responsible thing to do if we let guys like him accessing the server.

&amp;#x200B;

Epilogue:

A few days later I had to do a short visit on the customers site because of an unrelated project. When I quickly checked on the server I found an external HDD with a sticker ""NEVER PULL THE PLUG!"" lying next to the server. Not plugged in. 

The purpose of this HDD is to receive daily image backups of the server. Now the fact that it has been unplugged isn't dramatic because obviously we also have other backups in place (NAS &amp; Cloud) but I still found it mildly irritating that this HDD lay there unplugged when it even had a sticker on it saying that it shouldn't be unplugged.

So I asked the Boss if he had an explanation for this. Well, you'll guess it:

""Uh, yeah, you remember when we had to plug in the external CD drive to the server a few days ago? Well, we didn't find an unused USB port, so we had to pull the plug from that HDD...""

"That's not good enough. You're a computer expert, you should know these things.","I used to work tech support at a place that used to sell mortgages. They had a fairly specialised piece of software that they used.

Internet and Phones are down and not sure why,"I work for a small MSP in a medium sized city in the south east. We do mainly medical and legal practices, but also donate our services to a few non-profit organizations as well. Usually these non-profits are pretty self sufficient and hardly put in tickets for problems, but today was not one of those days.

Today one of our non-profit clients called in a ticket, saying their phones (VOIP) and internet have gone down and they are not sure why. A quick call to the ISP told me that their modem must be turned off, as there are no area outtages and their neighbors still had modems online. So I pack up and head on site. When I arrived I walk through the building and take a look at the server closet, nothing looks out of order and the modem is on and running. One of the workers comes to the closet and says they think they know the issue.

I follow the worker outside where the gentleman states that there was an old phone line running from the building that was draped on the ground going to the phone pole outside (there was a storm last night that probably broke the coiled excess cable and dropped it to the ground). He said, 'It was in the way so I went ahead and just cut it. The cable runs about 30 feet from the pole to the building, and this guy decided to cut it at the building and at the pole and throw the excess away. The best part is, the guy who cut the line was very pointedly telling me that downtime for this was just unacceptable and I needed to get the cable and splice the piece to both ends and restore the connection (which I didn't have the tools to do as we often times outsource our cabling). Luckily, the on site manager over him used to work at our company and she told him they would pay the ISP to take care of it.

TL:DR;

One of my clients cut their own cable line and caused their own service outtage. Then got mad at me for the downtime.",1083,0,1
New guy learns our most basic rule.,"Evening family. Have a tale to tell.  Literally just happened. 

Cast:

Me

New guy: My young cousin

User: Hapless as the day is long. 

I don’t work tech support anymore. Gave up that life. I teach now. New problems, but you never forget those tech support lessons. 

Today my young cousin learned our most basic rule. 

I get a call from him around 7:30 pm. 

New guy: hey goodolbeej, I’ve been working on this for a couple hours. Can you help me fix it?  

Me: “yeah sure. Tell me your problem.” I say with great reluctance on the inside. Phone tech support is the worst. 

New guy: “Oh no, I mean can you come out here?  User can’t get her monitors to work and she promised her boss she’d be able to log in tomorrow.”  

It’s a 45 minute drive to that side of town. Plus fix it time, plus the drive back, on a school night. I’m seething inside. All of a sudden this is my problem?

Me: “No. Not really possible. How about you explain what’s going on, maybe FaceTime?”

New guy: “Understandable”. (God bless him) “she has two monitors hooked up to her laptop. But it routes through this....box”

I’m worried now. Some cracked setup I’ve never put eyes on before. Splitter maybe?  Need to start with the basics. 

Me: “Ok cousin, imma send you a zoom link, so I can see the problem”

Queue a few minutes of logging in, sending a zoom link, hi’s and hello’s. 

Me: “ok, what kind of cable is coming out of the laptop”

New guy: “USB C. Like my phone uses to charge.”

Internally, I’m dying inside. That box has me worried. Taking the sub output via...special software?  We are so boned. 

Me:  “And that goes into the box?”  

New guy: “Yup.  I think it powers it?”

More internal, but now confused, screaming. 

Me: “Ok. Let’s take a look at the box. What is the input labeled as?  And also, potential outputs?  Let’s get an idea of what this is doing”

New guy: “Ok, it’s a dell, made in China...” (bless his heart, being so detailed!!) “here is the back, usb...Ethernet...power?  Power!? Wait what!?!?”

Internal screaming has turned to laughter. 

New guy: “Wait, User, you said this was powered from your computer?  Where is the power cable?!?”

I shit you not, this was her response. 

User:”Oh you mean this??”

New guy, in the purest form of relieved exasperation: “Yes I mean that!!!”

1 min later everything is working. 

Before I end the call I get his attention:

Me: “New guy, that was fun. I know your a little frustrated right now, but today you learned our most important lesson. And User, please don’t take this the wrong way, but new guy... Always verify the basics yourself, NEVER, ever trust the user.”

User, to her credit, nods and says “Oh yeah, no, he’s right.”",1978,0,1
"Unknown error, let's try the same thing again without changing a thing","Not really the tech support you might expect but technically it should still be tech support.

Mom: my mother, who is not all that tech-savvyMe: The cracker of the code

I am a student ""working"" from home during quarantine. Yesterday she had a friend over for her birthday (she had 1 friend over, the maximum in my country is 2 at the moment). Because I wanted to give them privacy, I vacated the livingroom. When her friend left again, I returned to the livingroom to this.

&gt;Mom: Oh when you where upstairs the dishwasher beeped some error code. So I turned it back on again  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: What was the code?  
&gt;  
&gt;Mom: I don't remember something with water.

I ran to the dishwasher to turn it off.

&gt;Me: Mom you have a phone take a picture of the errorcode and, next time don't turn the dishwasher back on.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mom: But why?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: You said it yourself it was something with water, you could've easily ruined a water pump worth $500

I know $500 dollars is an exaggeration, looking back at it it was probably only $30. Anyway I thought it might have been the drainpump so I cleaned it out, which was necessary because it was full of spaghetti. Besides, it was still in the middle of a program so I it was full of murky water so I couldn't see the pump. (I will not go in to detail how she scolds me for the parts dripping on the floor, but she did.)

So I turned the dishwasher back on and let it finish it's program. When it was trying to drain the water, it made a low grumbling noise and asked my Mom if she heard that earlier but she said she didn't. A few seconds later the machine beeped, and spit out an Error code and a picture of a spigot (so that's how she knew it was water related). The Error code was E24 on a \[manufacturer name\] dishwasher, and If you google that it's the drainpump having trouble. Turns out I missed a piece of plastic that was used as a seal for a plastic bottle of fries sauce (mayonaise like).

&gt;Me: So what are you going to do next time mom?  
&gt;  
&gt;Mom: Google the Error code?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: How are you going to Google it?  
&gt;  
&gt;Mom: Dishwasher E24?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: That probably won't work, you need to add the manufacturer. What is the manufacturer of this dishwasher?

While saying this I open the dishwasher back up so she could see the manufacturer.She got the point and now knows what to google. I doubt she'll remember it since it doesn't come up often and she needs repetition.

TL;DR did tech support on a dishwasher after it spit out an error code without solving the error and turning it back on.

PS: I love my mother, she is just not that tech savvy, and in her lack of knowledge can make things unintentionally worse.

EDIT: removed the name of the manufacturer just to be sure",240,0,1
"""hey e4, I have an idea!"" ""that won't work e3, hey bossmang, I have an idea!""","this was a decade ago when i was a lowly E3 in the world's greatest air force.

I was a radar tech working on the old tps-75 systems. the original design was from the 40s, latest upgrade was in 1975. The processor cabinet consisted of hundreds of circuit boards and took up most of the space in the radar trailer. 

for a few months, our system was amber, (partially mission capable). The way these systems work is pretty complex, but simply put there are 2 inputs. Raw radar data (primary), which are the returns from the RF that have bounced off of targets and the secondary input which comes from the transponders on each aircraft. 

there are different types of responses from the transponders, but we dealt with modes 1, 2 (military codes) and C (altitude data from the aircraft).

&amp;#x200B;

we had a problem that showed our primary altitude data was consistently between 500-800 feet below what the secondary mode C was showing for each aircraft. The senior techs tore through the processor cabinets, swapping every single card that had anything to do with processing the altitude data fro a new card.

So I do what any junior tech should do when confronted with a hard technical problem: I got out of the way, read the docs and followed orders. Except at the end of each day, we were no closer to resolving the issue. No matter what we did, no matter what we changed, the altitude would always be a few hundred feet low. 

One morning, heading out to do PMIs (periodic maintenance inspections) with an E4, I had a eureka moment of sorts. 

Me: Hey E4, why don't we try replacing &lt;unrelated card&gt;. It's a long shot, but hey, maybe it'll work.

E4: Nah

 We went through the startup sequence for the system, tweaked the I and Q drivers, checked the scopes, all normal. Left it turning and burning and headed back to the shop. Once inside, E4 suddenly has a great idea.

E4: I know! Let's swap &lt;unrelated card&gt;! 

Senior Tech: That probably won't work, E4. But what the hell?

It took quite an effort of will to not allow my jaw to drop to the floor, or to allow my rage to show too much. 

So we went back out with a brand new &lt;unrelated card&gt;. Turned off the system, took out the old and inserted the new and, hey presto, mode C and raw altitude data match. 

I was happy that the radar was back green, pissed that E4 stole my idea and passed it as his own, so i got none of the credit.But in the end it didn't matter. Because another junior tech forgot to open the vents the following week and the processor cabinet overheated and random cards got fried. Radar was red, and never came back to green.

tldr: radar is broken, i have idea to fix, e4 tech shoots down idea, then pitches idea to NCOIC and senior techs, idea fixes system. Later, the system gets fucked up because some other dipshit forgot to open the vents.",234,0,1
"Also, my granddaughter is single.","We had a customer, a very nice older lady,  who owned cottages on Prince Edward Island. I was working with her on some customizations and setup of the software, so I got to know her pretty well. I eventually ended up being her primary contact when she called.

One afternoon she asks if I'm married and at the time I wasn't and told her so. She then tells me that I should come visit since I've been doing so much work for her. She's starts telling me how she's been considering turning the business over to her granddaughter and that her only concern is that her granddaughter is single and she needs a man to help her with the cottages. Well that's odd information to offer to the tech guy.

This type of thing becomes more regular - where she'd offer personal details about her plans and such. Then one day she tells me they got a web site and wanted me to check it out. At this time not everyone had a web site so it was pretty neat and I took a look. She asks me if I noticed the ""pretty young lady"" in a lot of the pictures and tells me that this is her granddaughter. She makes sure I know it's her single granddaughter. Single. She tells me there aren't really any good guys left on PEI and gets straight to the point and asks me if I'd consider moving to a place like PEI if I knew a girl was waiting for me there.

Don't get me wrong, this girl was really pretty and the small cottages they owned were beautiful, but this was starting so sound like a mail order husband type thing. I laughed it off and we got to work with software configuration on some of the customization she wanted. But in my mind I start thinking about it. This is a really pretty girl and the business seems to be successful because she's paying for custom work. My mind starts telling me that this might be a pretty nice life.

But then my brain tells me to think of reality. I've never spoken to this girl and does she even know her grandmother is trying to import some guy from 2000 miles away to move in and marry her? It starts to creep me out a little and the next time I speak with the grandmother she asks me again. I tell her I'm flattered but not ready to move or get married any time soon. She tells me she's disappointed but understands and that if I change my mind she'll be happy to make arrangements.

I just checked Google and these cottages are either no longer in business or changed the name. I wonder if the granddaughter ever found a man.

EDIT: Reworded that first sentence to make it more clear who the customer is. Sorry for my poor wording.",1202,0,1
"Reliable Backup Systems are for weak mortals, apparently","So some fairly important backups were stuck on a way too old Server in our server room. The guy in charge is a co-worker at some far away location and more the software kind of guy, less the OS guy, yet what I thought sort of tech literate. 

Anyway, the Windows OS on that machine failed and refused all efforts to boot (recovery, rescue, whatever). All I managed was data access using a Live Boot disk that I booted into the RAM, since I needed the usb stick somewhere else. Found out most drives showed heavy RW error rates, almost toast. 

So I set up an SFTP, got him access and told him to urgently get his backups off this machine, as most disks in there are almost done for. 

2 months later, phone call...  

&gt; **Me**: ""So is that server ready to be scrapped?""  


&gt; **Him**: ""Oh not yet, the server just needs to hold up until the end of next year just in case I need those backups, then it can be scrapped. Just wait until then.""  

&gt; **Me**: ""You do know that you rely on a way too old machine with broken hard drives as your backup storage solution running a rescue OS in memory for access, right? And that I told you 2 months ago to urgently getting those backups off that server like years before?"" 

&gt; **Him**: ""Getting that much storage somewhere else sounded like a lot of effort, so I just left it like that.""  

&gt; **Me, eyes twitching**: ""How much data are we even talking about?""

&gt; **Him**: ""About one TB.""

I don't even...

In the end, I just plugged a USB drive into it to transfer the backups into our regular backup system.

**TL;DR**: Antique Server with failing drives and important backups on it is a better backup storage solution than getting 1 TB of storage somewhere else.",1257,0,1
Incompetent Security: Another Story,"Recently our parent company demanded we clean up admin rights in our environment. We had about 150 users who had been added to the local admin group on their PC. Some because no one wanted to figure out what in their workflow needed “admin” rights and try and fix it, and others were “temporary” but never removed. Once the demand was made, parent company retreated back to their tower, leaving us alone.

And thus, one day soon after our security team decreed, “no longer will any user be allowed to be added to the local admin group on a PC! Every account that needs admin access must be in a security group. We will configure a GPO to rip out all entries from the local admin group and add what we choose!”

“Will there be any way to give a user admin rights?” People asked. “What about even temporarily?”

“No! No user accounts allowed in the local admin group!” Security said, “If someone needs admin rights temporarily, we’ve created the security group “Temporary Admins” that we can add them to. That group will be added to the local admin group on all PCs.”

“But,” many, many people replied, “that gives a user admin rights to all PCs, not just theirs. That seems worse than just giving them admin rights on their PC.” 

“No worry! Security will approve or deny all requests for admin rights. We will be all knowing and keep the list in check and prevent abuse.”

“And how long will users be allowed to stay in the group?” We asked.

“We expect the users to let us know when they no longer need admin rights.” Security replied. 

If you’ve read any of my recent stories you know our Security team is not the best. So, this process was implemented, and Security received all requests for PC admin rights. And then one of the biggest flaws of our security team revealed itself. They do not question anything. They get asked to do something, they do it. (There were definitely times they granted admin access when stopping to question the ticket would have revealed other ways to get users access to what they need. One is TFTS worthy for sure.)

Time passed. All seemed to be going well. Then last week, the skies darkened. 

“We are following up on our directive!” a voice boomed from our parent company. “How many users are currently in the Temporary Admin group?”

“Uhm, 197.” Security whispered. 

“What?!” The voice boomed again. “How are there that many? That’s more than you started with!”

“We…we were expecting users to let us know when they no longer needed admin rights.” Squeaked Security.

“This…is what you came up with? We need to have a discussion with you…” The voice trailed off.

We now wait to see what the next process will be. Most likely coming from our parent company directly this time.",1526,0,1
3 SINCGARS radios are down and only you can fix them. Make us proud!,"SINCGARS. Is that even a thing anymore?  I did a quick google search and found a manual located at CryptoMuseum.com. WTF a museum? Damn I guess this was a while ago. Anyway . . . 

Thanks Major Boss. Yeah, I was pretty good with electronics and being in the commo platoon of BN HQ, I was chosen to go fix some radios. Apparently this was a big deal and someone was trying to impress someone else it seems because my chauffeur was the company CO. I'm a lowly Pfc being driven around by the Captain. Nice.

I was told that these radios were working the night before and I have very limited equipment with me to troubleshoot since this is just a short field training exercise. Basically a soldering iron, multimeter, hand tools and the fill device that allows me to manually upload a new hopset just in case that got buggered. Not a lot I can do, really, but most of the time the problem is a cable that isn't properly attached. 

So we roll up on whatever company this is, I forget but let's call them Echo because I was in 3 different Echo companies and I like the sound of it. We meet up with Echo's CO and he takes us to this swagged out GP medium tent, with all the accoutrements of home. These guys had Christmas lights, a TV/VCR combo watching Tombstone, rugs and lots of beer cans. And there on a well lit table, to my dismay and horror, lay the shells of 3 SINCGARS radios and what likely is the internal components of each. My CO  grins and says, ""It looks like we have everything we need, let's get to it.""

I ask the Echo CO what happened between last night when they were working and now and he tells me he's not sure, they just found them on the table. That sounds plausible of course. My theory quickly develops into believing that one or more of the occupants of that tent, probably the ones who emptied those beer cans, had a fun evening of disassembling these radios. I've never seen the inside of one of these things I don't know what I'm supposed to do, especially considering nobody will tell me what happened.

I explain that I have no schematics and I've never seen the inside of the radio and the Echo CO steps away then brings me what he says is a working radio with the top cover already removed. Is he running a black market radio business? So I get to studying the ""working"" radio for a while and then make piles of components for each radio. After several hours and several attempts I'm able to get things put back together and a 2 of the radios work. I'm also able to determine that the 3rd radio likely has a bad power supply.

That's when the Echo CO says, ""Yeah, that's what I though it was."" Then he decides to be honest with me. He and a couple other drunk soldiers decided they would troubleshoot the bad radio by swapping components with another radio until they forgot what goes where in their drunken state. Then they opened a 3rd radio and rather than use it as a reference to put the parts back in the first 2, they start cannibalizing it too. Drunk logic I guess. Aaannnnnnd then they open a 4th radio, but before they butcher this one someone suggests they wait until morning. By morning they were sober and that's when they called for help. The only reason this became a fuss is because the Echo CO caused this mess and he had 3 dead radios in parts to try and explain. I guess he called an begged the right person. Honestly any sober person should have figured it out by looking at a good radio because most components are just modules you can replace and not bundles of wires.

What did I get out of all this? The thanks of the Echo CO and my own CO. We also took the long way back, which included a stop along a highway at a gas station / diner for some of the best chicken  livers I've ever had. All I could eat and I was starving. I filled my plate more than once and probably went through a half bottle of hot sauce. I slept like a fat baby that night and now had a good reputation with the Major and CO.",296,0,1
"With great Admin access comes great responsib- no, that's not right, it's Tech Support's fault.","So there's a few bits of context to get out of the way.

Our customer resource management system has two user account access levels (given different names for safety):

* Admin - The administrative access level that our customers have access to. Lets you manage employees, see all their contacts, manage the website, ect. When an employer purchases the system, their user account is automatically an Admin. They have access to give Admin access to other employee user accounts if they wish.
* Grunt - The regular, bare bones user access for employees. You get what you need to do your job and nothing else. They typically manage their own customers/contacts, but Admins can manage them too if needed.

Admin users can send emails and texts in bulk to multiple customers in their account's database. Grunts can only send emails and texts in bulk to their *own* customers. Keep this in mind.

**TiltedCompany:** one of one of our largest clients, hundreds of employees on one account with something around 15 Admins.

**WrathfulOwner:** The owner of TiltedCompany.

So a few weeks ago, one dismal Tuesday morning, our first call of the day is from one of the Grunt users on TiltedTeam. They report, panicked, that they'd logged in to find that the system had sent a totally random out of context email to *all* of their customer contacts. At 3am.

I will note here that even though there's automated email and text features our users can set up to communicate with their customers, everything has a failsafe to prevent shit from getting sent outside of business hours. If those failsafes were for some reason fucking up, we were about to get a fucking shit load of calls. However, there is nothing to stop our users from MANUALLY sending emails or texts after hours.

As we're investigating this, we get a call from another Grunt user on TiltedCompany. Same thing happened to them.

As you can probably guess, everything snowballed from there and our ticket/phone queue lit up like some demented Christmas tree as more Grunt users from that company woke up to see all the confused replies from their customers. It is not even 9:30, half of us are barely into our first cup of coffee, and we've got enraged half-awake Grunt users losing their minds over this.

Some have to be bear-wrestled off the phones because at this point no one has a fucking clue what happened and no one's had time to check. Some have started email chains with our tech support email address CC'ed, causing a clusterfuck in the ticket queue.

Eventually, WrathfulOwner calls in and gets a coworker. Temper's high, boss status is up, and titties are *out*. Dude wants a manager right here, right now, and if he doesn't get one in the next 12 nano-seconds, he's sending a nastygram to our CEO. (He actually said he was in the process of writing an email to our CEO.) This mans is throwing his weight around so hard we can hear the walls crumbling.

Managers run a database query to find a list of all the user IDS for TiltedCompany that were logged in around the time those emails were sent. After getting our engineers to look through the system for any process history that a query couldn't find, they came to a few conclusions:

1. An Admin user had sent something around 70,000 emails in bulk to just about every customer under that account.
2. We didn't do it. The process was not automated and was user-initiated.
3. There are too many cooks in TiltedCompany's kitchen. Some of the Grunts do not even know who all of the Admin users are.

This information was politely relayed to WrathfulOwner in a long email from one of the managers tasked with taming the bull. He, of course, does not believe us, and demands to know why we would ""blame his employees instead of owning up to our system's error.""

In the end, it took another email and three phone calls (one of them with WrathfulOwner's director of ops on the line) to convince him that this was 100% on them and they were just in a huge amount of denial over the fact that they'd given Admin access to someone who clearly could not be trusted with that power.

The frustration/rage was understandable, really. Nobody wants to believe such a huge mistake could be human error, and it *had* resulted in some angry customers.

Crisis was averted, Grunt users were told to refer to WrathfulOwner for any and all questions regarding the matter, and we cleaned up the queue. I had to pull up their account for something unrelated about a week after this nonsense, and saw that the amount of Admins on the account had mysteriously decreased from 15 to 5. The person who'd actually done the deed, well....I didn't see her user account anymore.

TL;DR: Be careful who you trust with Admin access.",186,0,1
Standards?,"This happened when I was working for a Large Heartless Telecom Company who was rolling out a brand new wireless network.

How New? Back then RJ 45 was not so much a ""Standard"" as a ""Suggestion"".

Cue the nightmare. 

We were installing a Cell repeater at an antenna farm at the top of a very high peak. 

I drive up there but at about 500 feet to the top of the peak I come up to a gate. The other ""Competing Heartless Telecom Company"" had blocked access because ""LHTC"" had done so at another site. Apparently they could lease space at the top but whoever paved the ROAD to the top determined who could drive on it.

So, High Summer over 10,000 feet dragging up my tool kit I finally make it to my cabinet. I crimp my connector that will allow my remote site to get its DS-1 goodness. 

Plug it in. 

Nothing.

It doesn't feel quite right either.

Try another. 

Same deal. No signal, no blinky lights. This is a nightmare. I don't want to lug my kit 500 feet in elevation back to my truck and drive 500 miles back to the shop to get the right connectors.

I go back down the mountain to my truck. I find ONE connector from a different vendor. I grab it. Huff BACK up the mountain. (500 feet? You think it's easy? You try walking up 500 feet in elevation 3 times at 10,000 feet in 80 degree weather!).

I got one shot. 

I crimp that bitch.

Plug it in.

""click""

Green blinky lights!

I never again went out (and still to this day don't) without checking that the connectors I'm plugging in will actually mate with the device I'm plugging into.",289,0,1
The cookies are mad,"My coworker calls me this morning and the first thing they tell me is “the cookies are bad and (boss) told me you knew how to fix them”.
It was very hard not to burst out laughing right then. Of course, I began with some basic questions.

Me- what web browser are you using?

CW- google

Me- no, I meant what do you click on to open google?

CW- I don’t know. It’s blue and kinda circley 

Me- does it look like an E?

CW- no

Me- a compass?

CW- no, not that either

Me- just, tell me what it looks like

CW- I don’t know. It’s blue.

Me (trying not to bang head against the desk)- does it look like a wave?

CW- yes! 

Me- cool, you’re using Microsoft edge 

Cw- no, I’m using google

Thankfully after that, it was relatively easy to walk them through getting to security and clearing cookies. But then I get this gem.

Cw- if the cookies go bad, why don’t they use something with a longer shelf life? Like beans or jerky?",1693,0,1
New Girl needs help with IPNENE,"My office has a dirty WiFi network that we use to troubleshoot VPN connections. At the morning meeting, someone mentions that it's down, so boss tells New Girl \[NG\] to fix it, and we all go back to work.

Couple hours later, New Girl sends me a message on Teams saying she needs help with the WAP.  

JK - What’s up?

NG - I just got off the phone with \[ISP\] and I’m lost.

JK - What’d they say?

NG - They told me to set the router to IPNENE but I don’t know how to do that.

JK - Google it?

NG - It autocorrects to iPhone.

Trust but verify, right? So I search Google – straight iPhone results. Search it in quotes – IPNENE isn’t a thing. Grab my IT dictionary – nothing. Weird.

We talk it over a little more and I suggest swapping out the router with a different one from the warehouse. Boom, network’s back up. All’s good.

But I hate not knowing Techronyms. That’s a good portion of my job. And I’m pretty well-paid, and we work for a big company, and I should be able to figure this out, and it’s really bothering me, like I’m getting really resentful and stressed.

So I  track down my buddy from Networking and I start telling him the story, and he figures it out immediately and starts laughing at me.

You lowered your own access to the point you can't do anything,"Obligatory on mobile disclaimer. Also was a couple of years ago so conversation is slightly paraphrased. 

My main position at [company] is not tech support, but $Upper level boss manages one program for the company. $Upper level boss designated $me as the [company] internal support for [program]. $boss (between $me and $upperzy level boss cannot always figure out what she's doing) 

[Program] has multiple levels of access, ranging from admin (which is access to everything; desktop application and web portal,) to minimal web only access. $me and $boss both should have admin access. 

$boss: hey $me, is something wrong with [program]? I can't get anything on the desktop application? 

$me: I don't see anything. I'll look into your account and see if I can figure it out. 

I look at boss's account and it's no longer registering admin access, rather lowest level web only access. 

$me: uh, $boss you can't access anything on the desktop application because your access changed from admin to lowest access. I'll change that back for you. 

$boss: oh yeah, I changed it myself to lowest level so I could test something. 

$me: facepalm. 

If you lower your own access maybe it's a good idea to have another admin aware quickly to change you back when you're done testing?",1694,0,1
"Just started taking calls today, first call was absolutely insane","So today, after extensive training, I finally started taking calls myself. I was shaking I was so nervous, not knowing what to expect.

""Hello thank you for calling ______ advanced tech support this is _______ how can I help you today?""

""BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING... THEY ARE LISTENING""

""I'm sorry sir, who is listening?""

""I have had a problem with my device for two weeks and nobody fixed it yet. I involved the FBI Cyber Police Division and they're on the line now.""

""... Okay sir, that's not a problem. How can I help you?""

""My device will NOT connect to my internet because...."" 

at this point the customer ranted for an hour straight. When I finally got to speak, it turned out he never turned on his wifi to begin with. It was quite a way to start my first ever tech support job... FBI Cyber Police. Didn't have the heart to tell him that isn't a real thing.",2181,0,1
What to do when there is an broken pair on a 100 ft POE cable that's run underground.,"So a few days ago I got what I thought was an easy assignment. One camera was down on the gas pump canopy at a local gas station. 

Figured no big deal, these things are exposed to the weather and go down all the time. It is New England after all.

Drive over, have the camera swapped out in less than 5 minutes. Go over to the computer and go to assign an IP to it and have it start streaming to the DVR. One problem, the camera is not showing up.

Go over to the POE switch and see that port 4 is dead. Uh-oh those switches are not cheap, but the owners are. Especially when you have to buy them from Microcenter. But to double check I swap port 3 and 4. Port 4 lights up and port 3 is now dark. 

I actually breathed a sigh of relief. Figured that the connectors are bad. Grabbed a meter and sure enough, pins 1+2 had an open line fault. Cut the connectors off both ends, redo them, and buzz the cable again. What do I see? Open line on pins 1+2.

After offering a quick curse in 3 languages. And thinking about how much I hate terminating crimp rj-45 connectors. Redo them again, testing between terminations. Still OL on the first pair. 

Well.... Fuck. No way I screwed it up again. Checked the connector and sure enough the conductors are all the way up against the end of the connector. 

So it looks like there is a break in the orange pair. Problem is the wire goes through a half full conduit, underground.  No way I am pulling that by myself, and that camera has to be up...

So I call the boss man to tell him I need help. But he has an Hail Mary idea. We do need two pairs for data, but maybe we can send enough power over two conductors to power the camera. The distance according to the meter is only about 100ft. 

Plus the camera takes the poe voltage regulates it down to 5 volt anyway. 

So I decide to replace the orange pair with brown, use the broken connectors as separators at the connector, and run power over just the blue pair. 

When I plug it in, I see the camera power up! Holy hell it worked! Ran over to computer and I see it and can assign an IP! Set up the DVR and cast it to the clerk screen and called it a day. 

TLDR: Turns out a POE device can run on the power only two connectors can provide.",355,0,1
You don't even know your own product!,"First off, sorry for the extra long post.

I posted this in r/idoworkherelady but was requested to repost it here. I've also took other's advice and spaced each conversation point for an easier read. I didn't realize how long this post was and just burned through the typing without spacing. Sorry to the folks that had to suffer through the first draft and now need glasses, and thank you for the suggestion to repost it here...

Lets set the WayBack machine for the late 1990's, so I will be paraphrasing MOST of what was said.

I work at a small shop designing and building professional quality video hardware for TV and movie studios. I mean small. At the time there were 3 employees and the boss. In such a small environment, it is expected that everyone has a wide variety of duties and responsibilities, but each of us has a primary speciality. Anyone who has worked in a ""Mom&amp;Pop"" knows what I'm talking about. My duties ranged from inventory control to shipping/receiving to sales and technical support. Primarily, my speciality was technical support. One of our products places a ""bug"" in the video stream used for station identification. If you've ever watched TV, look in one of the corners of the screen during a broadcast and you'll see the station's call letters pop up. Yes, I know, don't hate me for putting up those annoying logos. In the USA, the FCC (Federal Communications Commision) requires it. These aren't the easiest things to setup up. Its a very specific series of steps that MUST be performed if you want any chance of getting the product to work. So, one day I get a call from a radio station in western Colorado needing tech support. What a radio station needs a bug for, I don't know, not my place to question, just get it working for them.

Ok, the cast: Boss: B, RE: Radio Engineer, Me: Obviously, ME.

I get the call from RE.

Me; ""Thank you for calling \*Our Company\*, this is \*Me\*, how can I help you?""

RE; ""I've been fucking with your bug generator for 2 days and can't get it to work. I have to get this working right NOW!""

I can tell this guy is frustrated, I would be too if I'd been trying to get something working and it just doesn't seem to want to.

Me; ""Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Lets see what I can do to get this up and running for you. Can you describe what your issue is?""

With a little more fire in his voice,

RE; ""I just told you, I can't get your fucking product to work!""

Me; ""Ok well, lets start from the beginning. What OS is your computer running and did you install Software Version XX.XX from the included floppy disc?"" (Yes, at the time we were still sending out the software on 3.5"" floppies.)

RE; Of course I did, but your product won't communicate (with the PC).""

Me; ""Can you confirm that the included interface cables are connected to your PC's serial COM port and the other end is connected to ""HOST"" on the product?'

RE; ""Yes, I've already done that. I'm the engineer here, don't you think I would have already tried that?!""

I'm thinking well, I have to start at the most logical place where comms would be interrupted, but ok, this guy is smart and knows his shit.

Me; ""Ok, lets go into the software and make sure its talking on the correct COM port.""

RE; ""I've already done that!""

Me; ""Well, just so we're on the same page I'd like you please confirm what COM port the software has selected.""

RE; ""How do I do that?""

Wait, what? Didn't this guy JUST tell me he already did this, he SHOULD know where to click in the software to see what COM port is selected.

Me; ""Please open the software and across the Menu Bar click on COM PORT and tell me what port number is checked.""

RE; ""3"".

Me: ""Ok, lets tell the software to wake up the product. Click on COM PORT and now click on ....""

With even more fire he cuts me off.

RE; ""I already did that!""

Me; ""Yes sir, you did click on COM PORT to confirm the port we want to ""talk"" on, but now I need you to wake up the unit. So, click on COM PORT and move the mouse down to Wake All Units and tell me if the front panel's LED blinks. This will tell you if communication has been established and we can upload your logo."" 

RE; ""Yeah, now what?""

Me; ""Did the LED blink?""

RE; ""What LED? There's no LED's lit up on this!""

Me; ""Um, ok, is the product plugged in to the power adapter and is the power switch flipped up (on)?""

Even angrier than before,

RE; ""Of course it's plugged in!""

I can hear him flip the power switch.

Me; ""Ok, is the green POWER LED on or off?""

RE; ""Its on, again I told you I've already done all of this!""

Obviously not...

Me; 'Ok, click on COM PORT and scroll down to Wake All Units.""

RE; ""Didn't you just hear me? I SAID I ALREADY DID THAT!""

Me; ""Sir, I am just trying to help and the only way I can do this is by going through each step.""

RE; ""FINE! What do I have to do now?""

Me; ""After you clicked on Wake All Units, did the LED blink?""

RE; ""I don't know, I wasn't looking at it.""

Not going to hurt the product to wake it up again,

Me: ""Lets make sure the PC and product are actually speaking with each other, please click COM PORT and Wake All Units. Tell me if the LED blinked after you clicked Wake All Units.""

Less angry, but I can tell he is still frustrated,

RE; ""Yes, the LED blinked 3 times.""

Whew! The unit seemed to be working and I don't have to give him the wonderful news of having to return it for repair.

Me; ""Great! Lets get your bug uploaded.""

RE; ""Yeah, this is where I have been having trouble.""

I'd say it started before he showed up to work a couple days ago.

Me; ""Ok click on File and Open Bug. Now I don't know where you've saved your image file, so you'll need to locate it, click on it and then click Open.""

his anger is rising again

RE; ""I don't know where it is, just help me load SOMETHING into it and I'll put my real bug in later.""

Not an unreasonable request, that's why I created and included some sample ""bugs"".

Me; ""Ok, click on File and Open Bug. Now scroll to the folder (company name) and open it. You will see several....""

Fire has become inferno

RE; ""Are you not listening? I told you I don't know where our image file is!""

Yea, they heard you in the next county,

Me; ""I understand that sir, I'm going to have you open one of the sample bugs included on your installation disc. These images are to give you or your graphic designer a sample of what this product is expecting when you upload an image.""

RE; ""FINE FINE FINE, just lets hurry up.""

DUH! I don't really want to be on the phone with this numbskull any more either, but I'm pretty much the ONLY person on the planet that can help him. This is not a boast, even the boss doesn't know how to get these products working properly.

Me: ""Ok, click on File and Open Bug, scroll to the folder called (company name) and double click it. You can select any of the images you see here and click on Open.""

He grumbles,

RE; ""I can't believe this is taking so long!""

Me; ""Do you see Sample Bug in the software?""

RE; ""I don't see it on the TV screen!""

Me; ""Yes sir, we haven't uploaded it to the product yet, we've only loaded it into the software. Do you see Sample Bug in the software?""

RE; ""Yes! For Pete's sake!""

Me; ""Great, now we are going to upload the bug into the products memory.""

RE; ""Its about fucking time!!""

why didn't I just stay in bed?

Me; ""Ok, click on File and Upload Bug.""

This should take about 30 seconds, 30 blessed seconds of quiet.

RE; ""Nothing is happening, I don't see anything on the TV!""

Ok, I did assume he had the unit hooked up to a source of video and then to a TV monitor. My mistake.

Me; ""Oh geez, I'm sorry. Do you have a source of video going to the INPUT of the product and the OUTPUT to a TV monitor?""

RE; ""No, I didn't know it needed video to work!""

Me; ""Yes sir, this product will put a bug on top of your video, it doesn't have an internal video generator, so you will have to provide a source of video.""

Unfortunately, it is a common misconception, but everyone pretty much just accepts it and finds something to put out video (ie. VCR (it's the '90s), DVD, or a video test pattern generator).

RE; ""Hang on, let me find something.""

Thankfully I get a couple minutes to hang the phone over my shoulder, sip a soda and rub my cauliflower ear, while he finds some kind of video source.

RE; ""You still there?""

Me; ""Yes sir, are we ready to proceed?""

RE; ""Yeah what now?""

Me; ""Do you see your bug on the TV monitor?""

RE; ""No, I had to turn the product off to plug in video.""

No, he really didn't, but a good tech probably would have, so I'll give him that one. However...

Me; ""Ok, uh, did you save the bug to the product before turning off power?""

RE; ""What do you mean?""

Me; ""After you upload the bug, you will then need to tell the software to save the bug into non-volatile RAM. Otherwise when you lose power, the bug is lost and will need to be re-uploaded.""

At this point, I could probably have just opened a window to hear him screaming

RE;""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?""

Me; ""I'm sorry sir, but no I'm not kidding you. Would you mind clicking on COM PORT and Wake All Units?""

RE; ""FUCK THIS! YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR OWN PRODUCT!! I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR MANAGER RIGHT FUCKING NOW!""

Me; ""Yes sir! Please hold the line"".

I put him on hold and walk to the back office where the boss is and am followed by my other 2 co-workers.

Me;""B, I got a guy on the line that wants to speak with you. He says I don't know our products and is....""

B: ""I heard, people on MIR heard""

(MIR was the soviet space station before ISS).

Me; ""He's on line 2, I'm sorry boss, I really tried.""

Boss gestures for us to sit while he answers the call. He hits the speakerphone to answer.

B: ""This is B.""

RE;"" Yea this is RE. I've been trying to get this product working for a week and the idiot I was talking to doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground. You're going to help me and then educate him on how to properly handle your customers!""

B; ""Sir, the person you were speaking with knows more about that product than the person who designed it. I heard what was going on...""

...I swear this is what B said...

""...You are too stupid to own our product. Return it and we will refund you your purchase.""

And then boss just hung up. He looked at me and said

B; ""And that's how you deal with that.""

After the three of us picked our jaws off the floor..

Me; ""Can I buy us some drinks?""

We never did get the product back, nor did we hear from that radio station again. I wonder if it became RE's new door stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading everyone. I actually cut back more than half of my original conversation with RE because he would continually attempt to jump forward steps and then have to start at the beginning again. The call took more than an hour before finally transfering to B. Have fun, stay Positive and test Negative.",1410,0,1
I wish I could tell why it is really 'broken.',"In my previous position, I worked as support for credit unions using my company's software. One day, I got a call from a guy who said a feature wasn't working. So I remote in and have him show me how he's reproducing it. The feature is supposed to add a file when double-clicked. It's working kinda spotty for him, so I try it and it works. Hmm... I have him try it again. Again, sporadically working. 

Then I realize I can here him clicking his mouse. One click, like two seconds, then another click. I ask him to try it again as fast as he can. Sure enough it works. Problem solved, right? No. He calls back an hour later saying it's not working again. So, brilliant me, I go to his mouse settings in Windows and just increase the amount of time he has to double-click. It works, I tell him to have a good day and call me back with any problems.

An hour later, he calls back to tell me it's been working and he's wondering what I did to fix it because he has the same problem at his home workstation. I explained it to him, showed him how he could do it. Suddenly, it stops working. I can hear him taking forever for the second click. I again tell him he needs to click faster - it was seriously set at nearly maximum delay. Nope. 

In the end, I had no choice but to escalate to my boss because he wasn't accepting my answer. I detailed what occurred in my ticket and sent it along. The contents of the ticket were something like this:

* Me: Customer had problem with feature X not adding on double-click; He was clicking too slow; Adjusted his Windows mouse settings for longer delay; Worked until I explained what was happening, then stopped working;
* Boss: Fucking really?
* Me: Yup
* Boss: ... God damn it.",507,0,1
My bartenders are stealing cash. Prevent it so I don't have to fire them.,"We see this a lot and I'm not sure what the owners and management are thinking. Maybe employees are hard to find or maybe they like the employee even though they're a thief. This particular customer had video evidence of several of his bartenders pocketing cash. The customer gives them money, the cash drawer opens, they stick the cash in their pocket and then take change from the drawer to give to the customer. Why you wouldn't fire them and call the police is a mystery to me.

But this customer was reasonably successful and had the means to pay for what he wanted. He already had a pretty sophisticated security camera system and wanted our software to interface with this camera system. To accomplish this he needed to get us in contact with the developers of the camera system software and explain to both of us exactly what his plan was. 

And this was his plan. 

* When a sale is made, send a copy of the receipt to the camera system so it can display it on screen, with a time stamp, making an easy reference for the person reviewing the video. This isn't embedded into the video, rather it's handled more like subtitles. This gives you an easily searchable reference for any time cash changes hands.
* Display a series of codes on the screen that the camera must detect and acknowledge before the POS software can proceed. The goal here was to make sure that every step of the transaction was clearly seen by the cameras. The following are when the codes will be displayed.  
1. Pressing the button to begin closing the check.  
2. Selecting the payment type.  
3. Accepting the payment.  
4. Giving change if any is due.

The purpose of the second part was to make sure that any time the bartenders handled money it was clearly seen. This would require an unobstructed view of the screen which would also make the cash drawer easily viewable to the camera. It's extreme but I suppose in a perfect world it might work. Also, in even a less than perfect world you can just fire your crooked bartenders that you already have on video pocketing cash rather than putting it in the drawer.

We ended up doing the first part of his plan but neither we nor the camera software developer were willing to entertain the guaranteed support nightmare of his second part. That's just so many points of potential failure that will bring the system to a halt. Neither of us wanted to put ourselves in a place where we'd have to support the inevitable failures. I hope he eventually chose to fire his bartenders.",2157,0,1
Two quick Friday stories,"**""Inability to take action within Gmail""**

Yes, that was the ticket name, the body consisted of:

*""I suddenly cannot reply to emails anymore and the ability to forward them is also gone as well""*

I remote into their computer while calling the user:

&gt;$User: thanks for getting to me so quickly, anyway I can't reply to any emails as the ticket said so you can take a look there if you want. 

I get into their main screen with their email open in front of me. I notice the reply button is missing and there is no drop down menu. I look at the subject and it says *""Hangout Chat message""* (sigh)

&gt;$Me: ""This is a chat message, for some reason Gmail likes to also put your hangouts along with your emails when you search them, yes it looks like an email, but its not. If you'd like to forward this info you can simply copy+paste it into an email. 

&gt;$User: ""But.....okay let me look, okay...so it is a chat message...but why does it show up here?? also let me go to a different email""

I can tell the user doesn't want to make it seem like this wasn't an obvious mistake. She opens another email and *tada* there is the reply and forward button. 

&gt;$Me: ""Let me know if you have any other problems down the line"" 

I close the ticket

---

**""My internet doesn't work anymore""**

Ah yes, the ticket with only a subject line but doesn't have a body to the email, no details expanding on ""internet doesn't work"". I try calling but no answer, I reply to the ticket asking for more detail but then I think well if they don't have internet how can they respond? I ping the users computer and sure enough ""hostname could not be found"". So I put my mask on and walk over to $User's office. As soon as I get there I see the user sitting at their desk, typing on the computer and fumbling with the mouse clearly frustrated. 

&gt;$User: I've been trying forever to get this thing to connect but it wont work. It's frustrating, I even had to go borrow *coworker's* computer so I could even send in that ticket

&gt;$Me: Okay, let me take a look

The first thing I notice is the massive red X on the network icon in the system tray. I kneel down and look at the back of the tower where the network cable comes into the computer and notice the ethernet connector plugged in but no wire, I look over and see the cable with the wire exposed, clearly ripped out from the end.  

&gt;$Me: well this is your problem right here, the cable was somehow ripped right out of the computer

&gt;$User: What? How could that have happened? Could that have happened when I moved my desk?

&gt;$Me: *pauses for a second* When did you move the desk and where did you move it from? 

&gt;$User: It was just right there *pointing about 3 feet away* I moved it over **here** because I didn't want to sit so close to the wall 

&gt;$Me: Well yes, if we need to move a computer, the cables have to be unplugged first. 

&gt;$User: I thought my computer was on wireless

At this point I'm just very confused

&gt;$Me: No, the computer needs a wired connection, it does not have wireless capability, did you notice any other wires while you were moving the tower?

&gt;$User: Well no, I just moved my desk, like I said I thought this was all wireless

This user just dragged her desk away from the wall, why? No idea

&gt;$Me: (trying hard not to sound judgemental) When you moved the desk, you didn't notice any wires at all?

&gt;$User: No, well I figured it would shut off if the power unplugged. 

I go to edit the ticket and CC my boss:

*User moved desk, did not check wires, the network cable was ripped out of the back of the tower, while replacing that cable I had an epiphany regarding their phone connection as well since I was not able to reach them, sure enough the phone cable was also ripped out. I replaced both cables and instructed user to check the cables next time they decide to move their desk around.*

My boss replied: *Facepalm*",210,0,1
A sad story,"I want to share a little story from yesterday that that made me a little sad.

I work in-house tech support for a highly competitive and commission based industry. Staff are performance managed within an inch of their lives, and terrified to display any weakness, mistake or lack of knowledge to their colleagues. 
This has led to a culture of over reliance on IT, as colleagues are afraid to ask each other, and when they do they're told ""Just call IT""

So on to the story. Yesterday a lady called. She'd waited an hour as we had a couple of major incidents to deal with. She was new and didn't know how to open Outlook. No errors or problems, just didn't know how to open the start menu and find the link. 
Her colleagues, instead of taking 5 seconds out of their day to help, had told her to call IT. 

Not much more to the story, I helped her open Outlook, and spent some time making sure she knew how a few other commons apps work. 

It just left me with a really sour taste in my mouth, that people would treat their colleagues like that",271,0,1
Something must be in the air...,"Seriously. Or they're drinking too much of the Kool-Aid. The past couple of days, our users have been even more...*special* than normal. I'm blaming the election nonsense. A few of the highlights:

**User Submitted ticket** \- summary of issue - Can't Print.....That was it. That was the whole ticket. And of course they don't answer when I call, because why would they? *Heavy sigh and rubbing of temples.*

**User calls in** \- Can't sign in to computer. He just changed his password, and now can't sign in. He's remote on a laptop, not on network. ""Just use the old password, that will work until you take the laptop into the office again."" Nope, not working either. Nothing is getting him in. Finally, I'm about to give up and just tell him to bring it in to the office, and he lays this on me: ""Oh, I've been able to sign in to the desktop the whole time, its Outlook I can't get in to!"" *Head, meet desk*.

**User calls in** \- Trying to install something on iPhone. Its asking for an Apple ID password, and he asks me what the password is because he doesn't know it. I give him the company default password, and he says ""Its my own iPhone, not the company's."" *Hello desk my old friend*.

**Another Call** \- This person also can't sign in. Luckily, its just an account lock. I unlock and tell them to sign in. ""Sign in to what?"" I ask if she was trying to sign in to the computer or to Outlook. ""I don't know, I'm just trying to get in to do work."" I ask what they see. Its their name really big. Ok, windows sign in, I tell her to put in her password. ""Which password? The one for my desktop, or work, or email?"" We have SSO. Its literally all the same. She's been with the company for over a decade, we've been on SSO for a few years now. She still thinks there are different passwords for everything. After 10 more minutes of struggling, I get her in to her computer, to her email , and to her 'work' (which turns out is just Citrix, nothing special). *I think I have a concussion now*.

I'm glad its Friday, I need a drink or seven.",343,0,1
Sandy Laptop,"I work IT in a government agency and we have a lot of users that are remote and use state issued laptops. Get a call from one of the remote employees telling me his laptop wont turn on. I asked him if anything happened to it and all he said was, ""it was working yesterday, I shut it down, and the next morning its just dead and wont turn on"". 

So I verified all the usual that I could do over the phone. Made sure power adaptor was plugged in (including the brick), tried different wall ports. It was indeed dead. No lights, no fans, no error code lights. Perhaps a bad power adaptor? Unfortunately no spare for him to try.

Wanted to do a power flush, but its one of those smaller 2-in-1 laptops where the battery is inside the case so you have to unscrew the back cover completely off to detach the battery. I had him try power flushing anyway without the adaptor plugged in but still nothing.

I have him bring it in so I can get my hands on it, and maybe do a proper power flush or try a different adaptor. I go to remove the case, and the moment I pop it off, water gets flung everywhere. That part explains it being dead but that's not really the ridiculous part. That comes last.

He notices and immediately is like, ""oh yeah I may have gotten some water on it, but I swear it was working fine even after for the whole day!!'. I tell him that it might be possible for a device to maybe work with a water spill depending on what it touches but it will eventually damage the important stuff and kill it if something is not done immediately. 

There was actually a lot of water inside. It was basically an easy decision that it was not salvageable. I could see little bits of rice from where he tried to syphon the water by sticking it in rice but it was just so much that even the rice couldn't absorb it. The odd thing is that the water was very granule, like it was dropped in the sea, or left on the beach when the tide came in. I noticed some of it caked around the usb ports and in other parts of the laptop. Was an odd mystery. I wanted to probe more but it didn't matter at that point. He ended up getting a completely new machine. Its unfortunate because the one he had was almost brand new.

The ridiculous part about this whole thing is that I got a more complete story about what happened a few weeks later from his supervisor. It wasn't dropped in salt water or left out on a beach somewhere during high tide. It turns out he tried stuffing the laptop in a big bag of sand after trying the rice trick and failing. That's right! He SMOTHERED it in pure granules of sand in a sad but comical attempt to save his dying machine before giving up and calling IT. If anything, stuffing the wet laptop into sand sealed the deal. Still don't know the source of the water though.",173,0,1

How Do You Not Know Me?,"Tech support life:         


Me: Hello, this is DB from \[Company\] tech support. Can I get your company name, please?  
Him: (Such and such, which I find in the system).  
Me: Thank you, can I get your first and last name please?       
Caller: First name last name.        
Me: Can you spell your last name? I don't see you in here.       
Him: Well, I should be in there. Are you sure?       
Me: Yes. Have you called in before?       
Him: No.

you actually need to dial using your phone!,"  

So, this one happened about 15 years ago, when I started at my old job and to this day it’s probably the most hilarious thing that happened to me in my time in tech support.

Half of the users were engineers, as was this one.

$me : me, duh

$user: well, the user, duh

$user showed up in our tech support office, claiming his phone is not working.

I told him to show me, and we went up to his office next to the phone.

I rung it up with my mobile phone and it worked fine.

I then used the phone to ring up my mobile phone, which also worked fine.

$user: “strange, when I call it doesn’t do anything”

$me: “ok, could you do a call then to show me please?”

$user went on, took the phone receiver and put it next to his ear. The he proceeded in dialing the number of my mobile phone. Sounds right? Well it would have, only that he dialed on the num pad of his keyboard!

Remind you that was 15 years ago, dialing software was practically unheard of and we had nothing of the sort, the guy also had been working at that office for 20 years so no, it could not have been for being used to used dialing software.

I explained to him that he actually needs to use the keys on his phone to dial and he facepalmed himself after realizing his mistake.",413,0,1
"Our Point Of Sale tablets are missing, you owe us a refund.","In the early 2000s we had a customer who wanted to be cutting edge and use wireless tablets. These were expensive and quite revolutionary at the time. This is also back when we were willing to risk selling hardware so we sold them 10 of these things. I can't remember the brand now but they were blue and silver and ran Windows 2000. Battery life sucked, too, but he didn't care because it was just so cutting edge. 

Because of the battery life issue, he purchased more than he needed so he could have them in charging stations in many convenient locations around the restaurant. I'll admit, the concept was really cool at the time and these tablets really looked futuristic and that's what he was going for. But do you know who else thought the tablets were cool and futuristic? The customers and the employees. After just a few months we get a call that half of the tablets have been stolen and that we owe him a refund for selling him tablets that can be so easily stolen. 

The sales person is trying to help him understand that stolen property isn't our responsibility but he'll hear none of it. When asked what we should have done to prevent it he tells the sales person that the details are our responsibility because we're the tech experts. Unfortunately he  convinced us to offer a 6 month no questions asked refund so he sends the remaining 5 back to us. Because these were hot items, we were able to easily resell them used at cost, so at least we didn't lose money. I'm glad we're mostly out of the hardware business now.",1693,0,1
user is so incompetent with tech that she repeatedly puts a Laptop in tablet mode and resets it to factory defaults.,"  

So, this one happened the last week I was at my old job, so I really just laughed it off.

$Me – Me

$Suc – my successor

$user - user

I had $Suc in Training, and as it was my last week I let him handle EVERYTHING, and I solely acted as a resource in case he had questions.

One of our engineers, $user, had requested a Laptop to replace her NUC, so she could do home office from time to time. This was approved by her superior.

My successor had installed the Laptop (and I checked and every configuration was correct) and delivered to  $user.

$user got an E-Mail from us saying that she should check if everything is to her pleasing on the Laptop and then copy all the data she had stored locally over to the Laptop, then have the NUC returned to us.

A few days go by and then $user called:

\-“yes, hi I just started my laptop for the first time and how do I access my e-mails?”

$Suc: “have you opened your VPN?”

$user: “how do I do that”

$Suc facepalms already: “$user, you got a documentation and a how to with screenshots on how to connect to VPN”

$user: “yes, sorry but I’m terrible in IT, I don’t understand that thing”

$Suc: “ok, could you open Teamviewer and give me an ID so I can remote into the machine and show you?”

$user: “how to I do that?”

$Suc: “there is a link on the Network folder just go to &lt;networkpath&gt; and double click it”

$user: sorry, I’m terrible in IT, how do I access that?

Meanwhile $Suc had put her on speakerphone so I could listen in.

We hear her talking to someone on the other side and then we hear the Woman that’s next to her.

She took over and $Suc remoted in and noticed that somehow $user had set the Laptop into Tablet mode… 

Of course, $user claimed to be innocent and that it has been like this since she first turned it on.

$Suc changed it back to normal and set up her VPN.

We thought that was it, but no. 2 days later $user called again.

\-“yeah, hi I just turned on my Laptop but it’s looking strange again and I can’t access my E-Mail.”

$Suc: “ok, I put a link to Teamviewer on your desktop last time, could you open it”

$user: “sorry I can’t find it”

$Suc: “ok, could you open up a browser maybe and visit Teamviewer.com?”

$user: “no sorry I’m lost I don’t even find a browser on here”

$Suc: “mh… let me think… could you maybe give me your private E-Mail and I send you the direct link to Teamviewer?”

$user: “I don’t own a private E-Mail” $Suc and $me both Facepalm at this… but well

$Suc: “I’m sorry but without the ability to remote in, I’m afraid you’ll have to come by so we can have a look”

$user: “but I’m at home? I’m supposed to work from here today”

$Suc: “yes but as you said yourself, this is not possible for you right now and in order for us to make it possible we need access to your Laptop”

$user was not happy and started swearing at this point, so $Suc hung up on her.

An hour later $user knocked on our door.

$user: “here is the Laptop! Now fix it!” 

$Suc had a look and noticed that, indeed she had put the Laptop back into tablet mode. He reverted that and then noticed that all her programs where gone, also the network did not work nothing…. In fact, this laptop had been reset to factory defaults!

$Suc went on to confront $user, but she just threw a tantrum and claimed innocence.

$Suc: “fine, I’ll reinstall it, here is a temporary Laptop for the time being, it will be done in a couple of hours”

Per my recommendation $Suc also informed her supervisor at that moment about what had happened.

Turned out, her supervisor did not give her permission to work from home that day, so she git reprimanded on the spot as well.

$Suc reinstalled the Laptop, we tested it completely, rebooted several times, and he returned the Laptop to her after setting her up her VPN while she was next to him.

One day later, the phone rings, it is $user: 

“yeah, hi, wth is with this shitty Laptop guys, again there is nothing on it, no programs, and the “tablet view” as you said is on again”

This is when $suc lost it: “well then fix it, you seem to be tec savvy enough to turn it on and even to reset a Laptop back to factory default. I won’t fix your Laptop again, bye” and he hung up, then informed her supervisor.

Sadly, this is where the story ends as I had my last day after this, but apparently of what I’ve been told, she just returned the Laptop the week after and continued to work in office with her NUC…",1542,0,1
'New Account' and 'Log In' are the same thing right?,"My job role was recently made redundant and I was given a position in a different government department doing something very different that amongst other things, involves offering basic tech support for an online account system. I'm learning a lot, including not to trust users when they tell me they've followed my instructions. 

The people that access these accounts own their own company or work within the finance or HR departments of a company so I assumed that basic computer literacy and language comprehension skills would be common. Never assume.

There's two types of accounts you can have; user accounts and company accounts. You need a user account in order to log into a company account. 

I had a 55 minute call today with a genuinely lovely, yet flustered lady who would not listen to what I was saying. It went like this (paraphrased from memory and edited to be non specific):

Lady: I'm trying to add my email to the account and I can't get in.

Me: Are your getting any error messages?

Lady: There's an error.

Me: No problem, what does the error say exactly?

Lady: It says my email is already in use.

Me: That sounds you already have a user account with that email, I can check that for you.

Lady: I don't have one. My husband has one, he's the one who logs into the account usually but he's not here.

Me: Are you using your husband's email address or your own?

Lady: We have the same email address.

Me: Okay so that's the problem, you can't have two users with the same email address. If you give me another email address I can add that to the company account for you (after passing a security check). You then just need to login to accept the account invitation.

Lady: it's Imclueless@helpme.com

Me: Great so I've sent an account invitation to Imclueless@helpme.com Can you please refresh your email client for me and click the link in the email.

Lady: Okay it's asking me to create a user account.

Me: Don't do that, you have an account, I've just authorised it on the system for you, you just need to log in to accept. Click the log in button and type in your email address and it will let you choose a password.

Lady: It says no invitations exist.

Me: That's strange because the link in the email is a direct link to invite you to the company account. Can you click the link again for me and press login.

Lady: It still says no invitations exist.

Me: Are your sure you're clicking log in and not create new user account? (I was getting rather suspicious)

Lady: Should I create a new account?

Me: (Please don't.) No, you just need to log in to the account linked to the email address you've just given me. That's the email I've linked to your company account. 

Lady: There's no login button.

Me: So when you click the link in the email I sent you it should bring you to a page. Don't click anything accept the link and let me know when you're on that page. 

Lady: There's no invitations. I don't understand why it's doing this!?

Me: Did you click anything other than the link I gave you? 

Lady: No it just keeps saying no invitation. 

Me: It wouldn't say that unless you click log in or new account. Let's try again, open the email for me.

Lady: It's open (I can hear clicking).

Me: Don't click anything yet. Read my email to me.

Lady: To authorize your account you must log in using the link below.

Me: Great, the link should be blue. Just click it once for me and nothing else. Do you see the words log in?

Lady: (I hear clicking) It says no invitation!! The email doesn't work! Can you send me a new one?

Me: Absolutely, you should have that now. Please click the link and nothing else.

We repeated the process with the new link 3 more times. No success.

Me: Right this isn't working so we'll try once more and then I'll have to send this issue to the department's specialist tech team to investigate since your email won't connect to the account.

Please just press the log in button, nothing else.

Lady: I clicked it and it worked, shall I create a password?

Me: Yes please do that!

Lady: Shall I use the same password as my husband?

Me: I wouldn't recommend that, another password would be better.

Lady: It says you have 1 invitation, should I accept? 

Me: Yes! That's perfect, please accept. 

Lady: I wonder why it worked that time and not the others, funny isn't it?

Me: Maybe it heard me threaten it with the tech team.

Lady: Ha!

Me: So is that all okay for you?

Lady: Yes so now I'm in the account can you help me do (insert rather complex financial nonsense)?

Me: Of course, no problem! 

And on the call continued. Still bumpy but much smoother. I think she almost trusted my instructions by the end. 

If you made it this far, you deserve a drink. I definitely needed one.",244,0,1
"Colleagues vs my ""lazy"" scripts.","I am a software engineer in climate controls. An abroad company manufactures controllers (think PLC like) and develops their programming software that we use to program these controllers.

We get daily silly questions from clients who don't even bother to look 2 seconds into their own system like:  
""Why is this unit not running?""  
\- ""Because it gives a malfunction signal to our remote web interface, as you can see when you actually log in""  
""Oh, can't you fix it for us?""  
\- ""No, we can't magically fix the unit for you remotely, you need to have someone present on site to look at the hardware.""

But it gets worse when your own colleagues are starting to show these symptoms too...  
I could say I am a lazy but efficient programmer. If I can spend 30 minutes to write a script to automate something that saves me 60 minutes of work, that's a great deal for me! Besides the custom software with custom program language (that looks a lot like visual basic) which we use to program these units, I have my fair share of knowledge with pretty general and easy program languages such as visual basic.

The units we have to program have a lot of hardware inputs and outputs. Digital, and analogue. And the majority of these analogue signals need to be logged, alarmed, etc. Or when we have a Modbus connection to another party, we have to create a list of all the signals that we communicate back and forth. So you can imagine it becomes pretty tedious and repetitive work to do the same thing for each of these signals every time. Sooo, time to write a script for it!

One day, I saw my colleague was struggling quite a lot with just manually copy/pasting these logging signals one by one, and changing each one by adding some numbers, and doing whatever was needed to make it work for the next signal, and so forth. So I decided to be this nice colleague and tell him: ""Uhhh, you know I have a script that can do this in a matter of seconds, right?""  
BIG MISTAKE!!!

My scripts were nothing more than a very simple .vbs file with a lot of ""shell.SendKeys()"" functions in it. Basically what this does is essentially take over control of your keyboard and start writing letters as if you were typing them yourselves. That means, you have to be careful and actually make sure any kind of text editor was open and active to write in, otherwise the script would start spamming keys and doing all sorts of weird things on your PC as if a horde of cats was walking over your keyboard.

Anyway, all went fine for that one single use... Until some time later, I got a message from this colleague asking why my script wasn't working and why it did all sorts of weird things to his PC. He showed me a screenshot of a text editor that basically looked like Chinese. Uh oh...

I had this problem myself once. It is caused if the script is too fast and the SendKeys function can't keep up and starts writing random characters instead of whatever you want it to write. So I tell him to open up the script and make it slower...  
Colleague: ""How do I do that?""  
Me: ""In between each SendKeys function, change the Sleep method to make it wait longer""  
Colleague: ""I already did that. I changed it from 1000 to 100 or even to 10""  
Me: ""\*Siiigghhhh\* It's a sleep command. So if you need it to be slower, you need to RAISE the number, not lower it..."" (Me thinking: Jeez, how can this guy call himself a software engineer if he can't even understand simple things like this.)  
Colleague: ""Ohhhh okay...""

Sigh, really if he doesn't understand the simplest edits in very BASIC visual basic scripts, he shouldn't even be in my scripts in the first place...",436,0,1
"Fixed the system, got put in jail anyway","Some years ago I forgot to pay a traffic ticket. Oops. 

And discovered that there was a bench warrant out for my arrest when I was pulled over. With my two older children in the car.

And found my children getting a ride home in a police car ( they thought it was cool), and I got a ride to the local jail. The cops were friendly, I was embarrassed and laughed at myself for being dumb. And then we got to the jail for in processing.

Photos, fingerprints, and then the guards were struggling with the booking system. So these words came out of my mouth ...

“ I work in IT, maybe I can help ?”

They looked at each other, and had me lean in. I walked them through setting up their new printer. 

And then was escorted to my holding cell. Until my wife was able to bail me out. The judge called me a bit of an idiot, I agreed, and paid the fine and court costs and towing and storage .. about $1k.

And told the story at work , only to be reminded of the Tech Support Creed...

Over heating modem,"Like my last story this one takes place over 20 years ago at Big V.

C is for customer 

C calls in saying his modem isn't working. I go through all the troubleshooting steps before the guy tells me this...

C: The last guy told me the reason my internet wasn't working was because my modem was over heating, but I did what he said and now the modem isn't working. Why can't you fix this?

I pull up the notes from the last call that C made into support and I shit you not this is what they said...

""... advised customer their modem was over heating and to drill vent holes into modem.""

You read that correctly. The last tech told C to drill holes into his modem, so C did so. Straight through the modem.

Because he was told by a tech to do that stupid shit, and the tech actually noted it, we had to send C a new modem. I advised him not to drill through the new one.

Note: the tech that told C to drill into his modem was evidently disgruntled and had told several customers  to  either do dumb shit to the equipment, or would actually make things worse before blaming their OS and advising them to call Microsoft before walking off the floor and out the door.",289,0,1
That's not a disc drive,"Almost 20 years ago I worked at a call center doing tech support for the big V and their dsl service.  Sorry for formatting, on mobile. 

Me is you know who

CC is clueless customer 

So I'm fielding calls one evening and explaining that no your CD tray is not a cup holder to people who shouldn't own computers (yes that was still a thing at the time) when CC calls in.

Me: Thank you for calling Big V dsl, how may I assist you today.

CC: I'm trying to set up my service, but the disc you sent won't run.

Me: I'm sorry to hear that ma'am. I'll be happy to help you get up and running.

So I go through the steps to get CC and her computer online, which surprisingly doesn't take very long.

CC: Great, thank you. One last thing though...

Me: Yes, ma'am?

CC: How do I get the disc out? 

Me: Just push the button on your disc drive and the tray and disc should pop out.

CC: My drive doesn't have a tray.

I'm thinking she has one of those newer at the time drives that just pop out the disc, which she does. 

Me: Have you tried to hit the button on the drive ma'am?

CC: Yes, but the disc doesn't come out.

Now we were not technically supposed to help with customers equipment other that the modem and router, but I try a few troubleshooting methods with her, but sure as hell that disc is not coming out.

Me: I'm sorry ma'am, but there's not much else I can do. You might have to take your computer to a shop that works on computers in your area.

CC: Well I'll just have my son look at it, he built it for me.

*Record scratch*

Out of curiosity I ask her to describe the front of her tower to me. Sure enough there's a thin space between the tower and the CD drive. CC had mistakenly slid the setup disc into that slot thinking it was her CD drive.

Me: Ma'am, that isn't the disc drive, that's just a gap between your computer and the drive.

Cue CC laughing embarrassingly that she couldn't tell the difference between a gap and the drive without her glasses. We end the call with me telling her to have her son remove the disc from the inside of her computer  for her and maybe filling in that gap so something like this doesn't happen again.

I made a user cry twice yesterday.,"I work at an internal helpdesk, a mixed bag of first and second line responsibilities. *LTL &amp; FTP and all that jazz, let's move on.*


*  $Me

* $User = Not me

Distressed $User comes in with an android work phone where the screen is cracked to hell. In the lower right corner you could actually see the hardware below the display itself, like the cellphone equivalent of seeing all the way through to the bone in a fleshwound. *ouch*

$User said her 3yo dropped it on the floor. No problem, she can replace a work phone once a year under the CYOD ('choose your own device') company program.

The issue, however, stems from transferring her pictures on the internal storage (not the sim, that'd be too easy) to her new phone. You see, the damage to the touchscreen was so great it could no longer register most button presses, let alone unlock the phone. Plugging it into a pc with an USB type c cable is also a no-go since I can't see the storage in file explorer unless the phone is unlocked. *Darn*

So at this point I'm trying to gently apply pressure to different parts of the screen to maybe hit that sweetspot where the stars align and it allows the 4 digit pincode buttonpresses to be registered. I made some headway and was able to enter 3 numbers but the last button wouldn't register no matter how much I tried.

Seeing my frown getting deeper $User suddenly bursts out into tears. As it turns out she had just returned from pregnancy leave, and all her newborn pictures are on that phone. *stakes = raised*

While calming her down an idea popped into my head:

""What if you plug in an external keyboard to enter the pincode?""

*error does not compute, phone has USB type c port, not type A*

So I grabbed one of [these](https://www.pbtech.co.nz/imgprod/N/B/NBADEL300__2.jpg?h=468406715), plugged an external keyboard with numeric keypad in the USB type A slot, plugged the retractable type c cable into the phone,
made a quick prayer to the IT crowd gods

And VOILÀ, phone unlocked!
I was able to see the internal storage on the pc now and then quickly save the pictures. 

Let's just say $User was crying a different kind of tears after this.",2094,2,1

Leave the money on the counter and you better not be there when I arrive,"This customer was just rotten and add to that a server crash. Looking back, I think he was going through some tough times because 15 years later he's a decent guy. But while he was a steaming pile of poop . . .

This guy owned a hotel and was cheap. I know, shocker! We should have known there was a problem when he started crossing out parts of the support contract like the part requiring him to maintain an on site backup if they don't use ours. We had a really old backup app that we installed anyway because it's better than nothing. We no longer support it and it was just there because he refused anything else.

A couple years later the peak vacation season of that year is about to hit them in 2 days and the server crashes. They have no backups. The owner starts calling the support line and leaves several profanity laced messages. Then he emails sales and support demanding that we come fix his mess. Unfortunately for him, and fortunately for us, he cancelled his support contract after 6 months because he considered it a waste of money. The person on call emails him to let him know that he has no support contract and doesn't use our backup service, so he'll need to contact his IT professional for assistance. This sets off a few profanity laced emails in which he insults several of us by name and the company in general for taking his money all these years but providing no help. He hadn't paid us a penny in a couple years.

Our CEO gets wind of this because he likes to check in on the support mailbox from time to time and tonight was one of those nights. He tell us to let the customer know he will not be helped and that any number he calls from will be blocked because of his abusive attitude. Since I've had the most interaction with this guy and was involved in the install, I'm picked to break the good news. But I have a thought. I remember that we installed that old, unsupported and unreliable backup and maybe it's still running. I propose to the CEO that I write up a short contract stating that I will come to his hotel representing myself, not my company, which has chosen to sever ties with him. The CEO agrees to this and tells me to go for it.

I write up the short contract and add a couple things. 

* I will be paid $500 whether or not I can find the data. 
* I will use only software tools already installed on site, so no data recovery apps or hardware recovery services. 
* I will work a maximum of 6 hours.
* He will leave the money in cash form in an envelope on the counter at the front desk.
* A signed copy of the contract will be in that envelope.
* He has to leave the property while I'm there.

He emails back that the money is waiting for me and asks that I be there as soon as possible. I arrive about an hour later and get to work. The server hard drive is making a clicking and grinding noise - I'm pretty sure software isn't fixing this. The guy working that night was there during the initial install and when I asked about the backup we installed, he said that it was still being run. He also said that after they added a second workstation about a year ago, he modified the backup to make a copy on that second workstation. This guy's actions saved the owner's ass. Without the backup tens of thousands of dollars in advance deposit payments would be unaccounted for. All those reservations would be gone and he'd have no way to prove who had a reservation or pre-paid without time consuming research. A nightmare for the busiest weekend of the year. Because of this employee's decision to add the second workstation to the destination list on the backup, the only lost a couple hours of work.

In the end I spent about an hour there. I restored the software to the second workstation and even tried installing the server hard drive in the workstation but it was dead. I left with $500 in my hand and a customer who would later email me and thank me for coming out even tough he had ""acted unprofessionally"".",1958,0,1
Another Shortcut Story,"Desktop Shortcuts have been the bane of my existence for years. I do not understand the mental capacity of a person that can not do their job without relying on a shortcut to do the most simple tasks.

So I get a ticket from a manager ""Jane is having a problem connecting to the corporate server. Please give her permission. I sent her a link to the server and she can not connect.""

Well, first off that is not my server to administer so I would have to contact corporate to give her additional rights. Luckily the manager included the link to the folder that she was trying to access. It is something like \\\\CorpServer6\\Production\\Groups\\ProductionAce\\Input. So I follow the link and I immediately go to the folder. So the server is up and someone (me) is able to get into the folder so the link works. 

I can't edit the folder permissions but I can see them. Yep, it is wide open. Low-security risk so no problem having ""Authenticated Users"" with permissions, which of course includes Jane.

Email back to the Manager and Jane for her to call me. With so many people still displaced by Covid, it is easier for her to call me than me chase her down. The phone rings and she explains the problem that the shortcut he emailed don't work.

I remote her machine and have her show me what she is doing. She opens his email showing a path to where the folder is. She clicks and tries to drag the texts of the address path to her desktop. 

""Uhhhh, Jane. Why don't we go to the folder first? Do you see that the address is highlighted in blue with a line under it? Well, that means it has a live hyperlink associated with it. Just click on it.""

She does and the computer magically follows the hyperlink to the server and she is in. ""What did you do?""

""Nothing. You just clicked on the hyperlink and the computer went to the address.""

""Well, you make me sound dumb when you say it like that.....""

Me: long pause..... ""Well just make a short cut on the desktop so you can get back here when you need to.""

Working in a 2 man IT dept for a $7 billion company

Marketing Manager outsourced all the heavy lifting to a design firm, they didn't really do much but take credit.  IT Manager believed in insourcing, and that's what we (IT) did.  They just did not get along due to philosophical differences.

Marketing told me what they needed to ask $Design Firm to make a wallpaper.  I advised resolution, file format, etc.  It was made clear to me by IT Manager my role was to do as little as possible (had bigger fish to fry than a wallpaper).

So marketing sent me the image.  I told them to put it in a Jira job and I'd deploy it next time I did server patching on a weekend (as I could force restart workstations on a weekend- I was told all devices must have the wallpaper at the same time for consistency). 

The fateful weekend came around, I opened my Jira queue and got to work.  I deployed the wallpaper, knowing it would take a bit of time to get deployed around all the workstations. 

After it was deployed, I realized the wallpaper was predominantly white.  Do you know what else is white on a desktop?  All the text on desktop icons.

Fuckity fuckity fuckity fuckity.

Called marketing manager - no surprise she didn't answer (once again heavy lifting outsourced).

Called IT manager, explained what happened.

I used to work as a mechanical design and CAD operator for an industrial kitchenware fab company.

PM: *deep sigh* I need to make a new introductory presentation for some new clients I want to take on. I’m trying to take the text from our standard intro presentation, but I can’t highlight the text! I’ve been at this for an hour, I’m going insane!

At this point, I’m wondering why he didn’t just retype it, but PM’s a good guy so I’m not about to call him out. I take his laptop and start looking through the ppt. Sure enough, I can’t highlight any of the text either.

Schrödinger's Resolution,"I am a Tier-2 Technical Support Work From Home Representative for a call center company near where I live. We take in a high volume of calls and the company has many employees across the different projects that are contracted with our company, so naturally, we are asked to take notes for every call we take.

Today an agent called in, asking for an update on a headset we are shipping out to her. It is coming from a site 6 or 7 states away, for what reason only god knows why. But I finally, in the long time have gotten to use one of my favorite scientific concepts in ticket notes.

The notes entered are as follows: ""Agent called in; requesting update on headset shipment; per \*\*\*SHIPPING SUPERVISOR NAME HERE\*\*\*, \*\*\*OFFICE SITE HERE\*\*\* is who will be shipping headset and because of backlog, may take 1-2 days to process and ship overnight; advised agent that, provided she requested and was given approval first, she could use pretty much any USB headset with a microphone, but made it very clear to agent that IT cannot and will not install drivers for the headset without prior authorization; also informed agent that we will still be processing the shipment out to her even if she does decide to go to the store and buy a headset;  **Schrödinger's resolution: issue resolved in agent education of status, issue not resolved as problem has not been fixed and nothing has been shipped out.**

In which Our Hero saves the day because he thought to take a backup,"Newish user, first post. Enjoy!

**Cast**

$departingOwner$newOwner$myBoss, who used to be reasonably proficient in $desktopDB development and support but is more into management these days$certifiableMe, certified in multiple versions of $desktopDB software platform

**Situation**

1. Company takeover. $departingOwner leaving to spend more time with his ~~money~~ family, $newOwner with ideas to take the business places.
2. $desktopDB database system to run the company’s operations. Developed in his spare time by $departingOwner. He knows his business, but has shaky $desktopDB skills.
3. Very old, very unsupported version of $desktopDB Server, running on very old, very unsupported version of Windows Server, running on very old, very unsupported Dell server on site.

**What could possibly go wrong?**

It starts with a call one sunny late-November Tuesday to $myBoss from prospective $newOwner. He’s in the process of taking over $company that runs on a $desktopDB database system. The system was built and developed by $departingOwner, and $newOwner knows his limitations (especially in that he knows diddly-squat about $desktopDB software). $myBoss sends me to $company and I give the system a brief once-over in the presence of $departingOwner. Meanwhile, $myBoss discusses future plans with $newOwner, including migration from dodgy on-site out-of-support server to a cloud-hosted arrangement.

Over the ensuing week-and-a-bit, the deal is gradually finalised. After much to-ing and fro-ing, I get word that the Friday afternoon is it. SO I rock up, get the master passwords from $departingOwner and change them all. This takes a while, since this is a $desktopDB system that started life many years before when it had a one-table-per-file architecture. That means that this system has 25+ separate files, each requiring a password change. Tedious and time-consuming, but straightforward enough. Finally, I’m done with the $desktopDB security changes. I double-check that all other system-related credentials supplied by $departingOwner are valid, trigger a backup of $desktopDB system, and copy completed backup to the office NAS.

After a relaxing weekend, I’m about to leave for the office when I get a panicked call from $newOwner. Sometime over the weekend, the very old, very unsupported server has dropped its bundle. It will not start up. It has power, and fans whirr, but it cannot boot.

If you’re thinking to yourself, “Aren’t you glad you copied that backup to the NAS on Friday?”, go straight to the top of the class.

So I jump in my car and head for the $company offices. While on the way, $myBoss calls to get a situation update. The gist of the discussion is that it’s time to fast-forward the migration to the cloud-hosted environment. He heads off to dig through his archives to see if he can find an old license key for the correct version of $desktopDB Server. Turns out he can - we used to provide commercial hosting for that version until about 5 years before, so we have a valid and now-unused license available.

On arrival, I have a bit of a fiddle with the server, but it’s definitely beyond my skill set to deal with. After a brief discussion with $newOwner, he agrees on the cloud migration plan, so I set to work.

After about an hour, I have a new cloud VM running and updated, with the correct version of $desktopDB Server installed and happy, and we’re ready to load up the data. This is where it gets ugly. The office of $company has an extremely crap ADSL internet connection that gets 1Mbps uploads if you ask really nicely. The total database volume is 20+GB. This is going to take a while…

There was a happy ending. We worked out that $newOwner had a good 4G cellular data signal, so I hot-spotted onto his phone to upload the data. Some time later, all is ready, and the users log on. Everything works, and lo, there is much rejoicing. Well, some rejoicing. Performance sucks because (a) see above re. crap ADSL and (b) various inefficient aspects of system design that go unnoticed on a LAN but become \*very\* noticed when there’s a more latency and a slower connection.

Update:

1. There was a better internet connection already planned, and it arrived not long after this, so they weren't suffering for long.
2. We used the Christmas-New Year company shutdown to migrate them to the current, supported version of the $desktopDB platform, complete with properly-secure server-client connections.
3. In the time since, we have made some architectural adjustments to reduce the inefficiencies. It's still not great, but now it's less terrible.",232,0,1
No pressure...,"Here's another story from my time in Cash Register Service.

It's not anything extraordinary, just something that caused me an inordinate amount of stress compared to the actual level and nature of the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

We sold some cash registers to a canteen that sold various items to their clientele.

One day we get a call. One of the machines is down. They only have two so its a big deal for them.

&amp;#x200B;

I go out there and check out the machine. It has a slot in the printer that is usually used for check validation but they are using it for account validation. If any of their clients buy anything, the clients chit gets validated.

So, what happened was the clerks were stapling the chits to the receipts and then sticking them in the slot to validate. After a few months enough of the staples had been torn off by the dot matrix print head to start interfering with the mechanism. Fortunately this printer used a single side trace circuit board or else the staples would have fried the machine.

I clean out the staples and return the machine to service.

Did I mention who the client was?

This was a federal prison.

I had to sign a waiver saying the guards could shoot me if I became a hostage. If I had worn blue pants that day they would have sent me home because I could be mistaken for a prisoner.  I could see a door with a sign on it saying ""Death Row"" from where I was working. If I couldn't get this machine running and the other machine went down the prisoners cannot buy their ramen and cigarettes. No Pressure.

We made a deal with them after that so when it failed the next time they would bring the machine to the minimum security area so I wouldn't have to sign the waiver.

I don't miss that job at all....",174,0,1
The Plastic Sword,"We got this printer about 3 years ago. Then I moved to a different city and my uncle took it, only to print merely 200 pages and to give it back in a non working condition. They said they got it checked and the person was charging them way too much for it to be worth it. They said it was better to just buy a new printer. And so this printer was just lying in my closet collecting dust for 2 years.

I came back home a few days back to spend some time with the family. I took this printer out today because I wanted to scan some old photos. And I was like what the hell,  I’ll check it once again. 

I started digging through stuff online, and I could only find out that the error code meant there was some mechanical issue. 

Then I started tinkering. First I reinstalled the toner. No luck. Then I picked up a screwdriver, and unscrewed the first few shiny looking screws on the printer. They were holding a metal tray at the bottom. This plastic sword came out of the bottom metal tray. 

The printer is working now. So much for the repair being “not worth it”.

A psychic Dell tech?,"I fix computers, as I'm certain the grand majority of us here do- and on occasion, it *is* necessary for us to have to talk to the manufacturers. 

Background: I have a laptop I'm working on, busted screen. It's backlit, but shows no info. I popped it open, made sure the cable on the MotherBoard was seated correctly and determined it's probably the screen. 

Me = me, DS = Psychic Dell Tech/Supervisor 

(What follows is an extremely abridged version of the conversation)

&gt;DS: Yoooooo

&gt;DS: How can I help you today? 

&gt;Me: Pretty simple, I have a laptop in warranty with a bad screen, just need you to send me a new one. 

&gt;DS: Cool, give me a sec to find the troubleshooting questions... 

&gt;Me: All good, you new? 

&gt;DS: No, I'm a supervisor, pretty much everyone called out because we have freezing rain. So, here I am, filling in!

(Flash forward to today) 

I have received the box, I have scheduled time with the user to get her laptop back and do the install. 

I get her laptop, I open that puppy up and then...

Upon opening the box, I find- 

The screen bezel, and a new screen cable, but no screen to be seen. 

**God Damn** I *trusted* you DS!

So, I decided ""Screw it"" and installed the screen with the new bezel and screen cable, I start dialing the customer as I angrily finish closing up the laptop and hit the power button out of habit. 

... When the laptop powers on... problem free... 

I open and close the laptop several times to verify, but god damn, it totally works!

"A tale of spelling, accents, and NATO alphabet","This happened about 5 years ago at my previous job.  I was providing tech support to external customers of $bigSoftwareCompany in Canada. 

A customer calls in to create a new support ticket, but he is not in our system.  

Not a problem, I just need his name and email address to add him, create the ticket and assign it to the appropriate support team.  

This is were the fun starts.  The  customer has an accent from the Pakistan/India/Bangladesh area.  I'm french Canadian so I have a french accent when I speak English. 

The phone conversation happens in English:

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: I need to add you in our system. What is your fist name? 

$Customer: John

$Me: And your last name? 

$Customer: \[Speaking very fast\] Gappabolupabolu (Not his real name obviously, but you got the idea)

$Me: I'm sorry can you spell your last name for me? 

$Customer: ""G""... ""A""... ""P""... 

$Me: ""G""... ""A""... ""P""... 

$Customer: No it's not ""P"", it's ""B""!

$Me: Oh sorry!  so  ""B""... 

$Customer: No it's not ""B"", it is ""B""! 

$Me: ...

$Me: I believe that is what I said. 

$Customer: No you said ""B"", but I said ""B""! Not ""B""!!!

$Me: You mean ""B"" like ""Bravo"" ?

$Customer: No no no, ""B"" like ""Papa"" !! 

(To clarify: he did say ""B"" like ""Papa"" and not ""B"" like ""Baba"")

$Me: Oh I see, so it's  ""P""

$Customer: \[yelling\] ARE YOU DEAF ?? It's not ""P"" it's ""B""!! 

$Me: ""B"" like ""Papa"" ? 

$Customer: YES,  FINALLY !! \[condescending voice\] Is this too hard for you? 

$Me: OK, so ""B"" like ""Papa""... 

I type: ""P""

&amp;#x200B;

This continues for the rest of his name and email. The system then automatically sends him a confirmation email... the longest 30 seconds of my life... 

But in the end I got it right, created the ticket and took a loooong coffee break after that call.

Your backup service failed and now you have to pay for our data recovery,"TL;DR  
Customer ignores warnings (emails and phone calls) for almost a year that their backup service is failing and blames us when the server crashes.

Have you ever had a customer that refuses to read emails? We have a lot of them and sometimes it bites them in the ass - hard.

At some point this customer had emailed us asking how to move the software from one server to another, so we sent them links to our help site and offered to assist them since they have a support contract with us. We never hear back and the ticket it closed. A couple months later a technician reaches out to them because their backup service has failed a few days in a row and they hadn't responded to the automated emails that warn them there's a problem. Again, no response from the manager or the IT contact we have for them responded. However, a couple weeks later the backup services started working again. \*Looking back, we believe this is when they reinstalled the backup service.

Maybe a month later there's another problem and the backup result emails are now warning that the data in the backup isn't recent. It lets them know how old the data is and to contact us to troubleshoot, but if they know that no data has changed, not to worry. But just to cover ourselves we contact them several times but never get a response. \*Looking back we now believe that someone brought the old server back online and that the backup was now running on the old server. We can't explain why the new server wasn't also backing up but then again they never told us they actually got a new server and never let us have remote access to diagnose. Hell they never returned our emails or calls either.

And then it gets worse. The backup archives begin to drastically change in size from day to day and often a week or more goes by between successful backups, and those successful backups contain data that hasn't changed in more than 10 months. At this point the email warnings are also telling them the backup archives are broken. After a few more ignored emails from a technician they are called and warned. The manager was too busy to speak with the technician so all they could do is leave a message. The IT guy was also unavailable so a message was left for him as well. We never got return calls. We're pretty sure this is when the server hardware started to fail and incomplete archives were being uploaded.

Then the inevitable happens. The customer who won't address technical issues usually has poorly maintained hardware. Their server crashes when their hard drive fails. No raid? No problem! At least they saved the money for a second hard drive, right? They call and need us to help them recover the data. We ask if they have access to the external drive or NAS that they were backing up to and they tell us that it was just another partition on the drive that failed. So they ignored the warnings and popup box when they set it up. Fine. I check the cloud storage and they still have no valid backups. I'm able to  recover data for them but it's almost a year old at this point. We tell them they need to send the failed hard drive off to a data recovery company.

A week later, yes a WEEK later, the owner of this place calls us. He is pissed and has heard from his manager and IT guy how all of this is our fault and we need to pay for data recovery. We calm him down and explain what has been going on and send him tickets and emails showing how long this has been going on. He gets calls back the next day from the business with the manager and IT guy all on speaker and they each give their best CYA speech. The owner hadn't told them he had documentation yet so he asked why they never responded to emails or calls. The manager says that because we send so much spam that he had to block our email address. Backup results come from a unique address and only send you one message a day, but it looks scary when the backup is failing. He just didn't want to deal with it and flagged it as junk. The IT guy says since it's our service we should have fixed it for them long ago. That's hard to do from 1500 miles away without remote access, especially when you ignore our calls and emails, but, yeah, must be our fault. The IT guy also refuses to address the fact that every day he received an email telling him the backup had old data. 

The owner starts to get a picture of what's been going on and apologizes and asks what they can do now. We tell him that a data recovery service it probably the next step. After that they should follow basic reasonable backup procedures. Yes the manager still works there and the IT guy does as well. They cancelled our backup service though so I really hope they installed something else.",723,0,1
Didn't have the heart to correct her,"This happened about a year ago while working as a level 1 help desk tech at a bank. User calls in stating the printer wasn't working. She was very kind and trying to be very helpful which is unusual so this put me in a good mood. I did the customer service bit where I ask about her day, and it was a pleasant conversation before getting to the issue at hand. While conversing I looked up the printer and it appeared to be offline.

Me: ""ok so it looks like the printer is not showing up. Let's go ahead and unplug it and plug it back in"" *insert power cycle fixes everything joke

Her: ""oh I already did that, yeah I know the the information runs through the power cable so thats the first thing I tried. And people around here think im crazy""

I stopped and did a mental face palm. My first thought was no wonder people think youre crazy.She said this in such a ""matter of fact"" kind of way with so much confidence i didnt want to shatter her and make her feel bad. So I ignored the remark and just proceeded through the troubleshooting and got the printer working again

Still think about this story every once in a while. Maybe i should have corrected her. But I feel like that would have done more harm than good.",255,0,1
Which report shows why we're missing so many cases of liquor?,"This was a local customer who, thanks to investors, had more money than brains and hired all his friends to manage some shops in a small high end community. Every month one of the bars is showing thousands of dollars in losses of liquor and they just can't seem to figure it out. Since they're using our software for inventory management, they want us to tell them where all that liquor is going. Unfortunately, all we can do is show them receipts, sales, adjustments and physical inventory. The losses all become evident at each physical inventory so to me the obvious answer is that the liquor is walking out that door in large quantities and nobody is paying for it. 

The money guy scoffs at me and insists that there must be a software bug because there's no way that much inventory gets stolen without him seeing it. He believes that the liquor is being sold but just not recorded. Which of course in my mind should leave you with massive overages in your cash drawer but sales from the POS very closely match the inventory numbers.

So I agree to come out on a busy night and observe things to see if I can figure it out. What I observe is money guy at the bar getting drunk and flirting with the really hot bar manager. He stays in a stupor for the entire evening and can't possibly be keeping an eye on things. I ask some of the other employees if they've seen anything going on that might account for large quantities of missing liquor. One girl tells me that the manager's son often comes in and takes a case or two out the back. This is apparently common knowledge to the employees and their understanding is that the manager's son is simply using the bar to get liquor at cost.

The next afternoon I call money guy and explain what I was told. He speaks to the manager who naturally assures him this isn't happening. I give him the name of the person I spoke with and when he speaks with her she confirms and gives the names of several other employees who also confirm it. The police are called and when this is all over both the manager and her son are arrested. The son managed a small bar and was selling the stolen liquor to his bar. We earned a lot of trust because of this and the money guy realized that getting drunk every night was probably making the liquor theft easier.",2637,0,1
The numbers are off but we've been drinking.,"This honest revelation came from one of our customers who got an early start to a New Year's Eve celebration. They were trying to run the last payroll of the year and noticed that things weren't right and needed to call for help. Thankfully their payroll guy recognized that he was drunk and confessed to us that they had started drinking at about noon and were now too drunk to find the problem. Rather than completely mess things up they all decided they better stop and call us. 

Having pity on them, it was turned over to one of our accounting wizzes and she found that it was a simple matter of missing one of the steps. The payroll guy was able to successfully run payroll, says this is his last official duty of the year and is about to hit the hard stuff and thanks us for saving his butt. About a week later we get a delivery of a basket with wine, cheese, sausages, etc., along with a letter from this company thanking us for helping them even though it was their own fault for being drunk.

“Caller can’t”,"Nearing the end of my shift, it’s raining and I’m not keen to drive in traffic so I decide to work through some tickets sent our way by the global help desk.

Customer wants to save money == deletes local profiles off nearly 1000 devices,"TL:DR - Customer wants to save money, screws up badly and we can bill them a lot of money to help

I work for a MSP providing outsourced desktop support for a government agency

One of our guys has developed a script to safely remove old profiles from PC's. It's an advanced script that by default deletes profiles not in use for 90 days or you can specify a date. It  detects known profiles that aren't to be deleted (local PC accounts), detects if the profiles have any office documents or PST files and skips them if they are there and  also logs all the folders and profiles deleted with timestamps and who ran the script to cover our ass

We have been using it ad-hoc for a while but we proposed to the agency that we can package it up and get it to run every 30 days to remove profiles older than 90 days. They declined it due to cost (We would obviously charge them to create the package and for testing etc) and risk of data loss. Fair enough

Fast forward 6 months to last week, and we get a lot of tickets for users profiles being wiped while in use and missing data. They didn't want our script, but decided to get someone internal to write on up and deploy it. Instead of deleting profiles greater than 90 days old, the genuis used delprof to read the last modified date of ntuser.ini instead of ntuser.dat. Ntuser.ini is rarely updated so it didn't matter if you were still logged in actively using it, it deleted their profile based on the age of that file

Nearly 1000 PC's had all their profiles nuked, including ones still in use. Most of them had folder redirection so no major loss of data, but there are at least 100 that I know of that had locally stored data which is now all gone. This includes PST files stored locally, excel spreadsheets, PDF files you name it

So now comes the fun times as they have asked us to help recover as much data as we can using recovery tools which is now all billable time $$$$$",1143,0,1
"Yes, strawberry fluff is an acceptable payment for on site support.","We had a customer who's since retired and closed his restaurant, but he was one of our favorites not just because he was a nice guy, but because he was down the street from our office and he was an amazing chef. He was the kind of guy that would get stressed and want to see things happen immediately but he was always willing to pay.

The year this happened had been a particularly rough for him and we knew he was hurting financially. He always payed us something even if he was short on cash that month, but he always caught up. He had a grandchild that needed a lot of medical attention so he was spending his money helping his daughter so she didn't have to work while the grandchild was getting the help he needed. He wasn't a saint, but he was close.

His building is really old, in an historic part of town, and one of the older water pipes gets a leak and sprays on some of the computer hardware that's on the bar. He needs to replace this stuff but doesn't have cash on hand and doesn't want to wait for insurance. So he calls us. We have lots of demo hardware sent to us by manufacturers to test and ""certify"" and often they never ask to have it sent back. We offer to let him use this stuff until he gets his finances sorted out. He also requests that we help him get all this set up so we send him a proposal to sign with the estimated cost.

He calls back and says he appreciates the hardware loan but can't afford to pay for setup so he'll send his staff over and they'll pick it up and help him get it set up. We all feel pretty sorry for this guy since we know him well and we want him to succeed. I call him back and tell him that I'll do the setup for him for free since he's been a faithful customer for so many years. He won't accept free service and offers to deliver lunch for 10 with his amazing strawberry fluff desert as payment when we're ready for it. Strawberry fluff is all I needed to hear. I go straight to the boss and it took him about 5 seconds to agree to the terms.

I followed his employees back to the restaurant with the hardware he needed, set things up for them, and then scheduled our fantastic lunch for the next week. That strawberry fluff was the best payment we ever received.

Edit: I've had a couple people ask what strawberry fluff is and this is what it is to me.

This was a pie with fluffy graham cracker crust of his own magical design, sliced strawberries and sliced pecans in a heavenly filling. And it was so fluffy - like the clouds the gods must sleep on. It was an experience that's hard to describe with mortal man's words. It was just sweet enough to tickle your dreams but let you eat two slices without feeling guilty. That first kiss from a new love, the gentle cooing of a new born baby, that feeling that only grandma's hug can give - all rubbish compared to this. I dare say you'd sell your soul for another slice if that were the price being asked.",2855,1,1
Locked File on Network Share plus tons of tickets,"Note: Posting this before I forget what happened today.

I got  several emails today about a file on a network share being locked out by about five or so users. I was told to work on this issue, but I don't have access to the user's share, so there wasn't much I could do. It took me few minutes to read through the email chain to get an idea of what was going on. I told the IT person above me on the account that there wasn't much I could do and that a server admin should get involved, which no server admin was on the email chain that I know of. So, with trading emails and IMs back and forth, I included our local server admin on the replied emails so they were in the loop and  to investigate further, since they have more ""powers"" than I do.

The ticket for the issue was not assigned to me, but was provided. 

After going through the above, I pull up the ticket and see what level 2 has done. Reading through the ticket, level 2 only did the common things on the user's PC/asset. When want needed to be done was for a server admin to see what the share location was and what file(s) were involved. Also to see if they could unlock the file. 

The server admin replied to the email chain, asking if the should go ahead do what needed to be done on the server side to unlock or release the file(s).

This has been at a stand still, so I won't have an update until tomorrow or Friday.

Besides that issue today, I had two user's contact me with their issues, which their tickets were assigned to me, but due to the network share issue, those had to be put on the back burner.

My computer only runs on BIOS,"Disclaimer, I do not do professional tech support, I'm just that friend everyone goes to for tech support

So a friend of mine (who shall henceforth be referred to as F) told me his computer wasn't working. The conversation then went something like this:

ME: Is it Mac OS or Windows?

F: BIOS

ME: do you mean IOS or maybe BeOS?

F: no, I mean BIOS, do you really think I don't know my own operating system?

ME (visibly confused): uhhhh, BIOS isn't an operating system I think you would want to use 24/7

F: well it's better than Windows, that's why I made sure to switch to BIOS when I got my computer

At this point I was wondering just how big of an idiot I was dealing with and decided to just have him show me his computer, he turns it on and to my surprise, it actually boots up in BIOS, but according to him, this was the problem. I choose to enter normal startup, it boots up windows, and he is amazed that I figured it out so quickly. I wanted to sit him down and explain what BIOS actually was and that his computer ran on Windows, but I've learned not to argue with stupid, especially when stupid pays you $10 to choose enter normal startup.

Tldr: person insisted their computer didn't have windows, was wrong, and knows nothing about BIOS

Edit: laptops run on Mac OS, not IOS, my bad.",1612,0,1
Got a cheater busted,"So I do tech support for a certain technology company that is named after a fruit. (Names of company and products changed for obvious reasons) this guy called in stating his EyePhone was stolen. His EyeMessages weren’t showing up on his iTablet (your messages show up on all fruit devices including computers if you have fruit Message turned on under Fruit Cloud settings on the devices you want them to capture). So I helped him turn them on.

Had him go into fruit cloud settings and turn on fruit messages sync. They still weren’t showing up. Told him to turn off his iTablet. I sent a “verify” request to verify his identity so I could check on our end to see if his device was signed in and told him it would show up when he turned his iTablet on. He told me it came thru on his “other (fruit phone) that belongs to my girlfriend”. I then educated him on how it is not a good idea to share Fruit IDs and she should have her own. He insisted she did but it’s not possible for two Fruit IDs to be signed in at once.

He turns his iTablet on and notices that his girlfriend’s Fruit Message conversations are now syncing to his iTablet. Further evidence that she is signed in with his Fruit ID. I then reiterate that “these problems can occur when you share Fruit IDs” to which he snaps and insists she isn’t (controlling people tend to make their SOs share Fruit IDs so they can keep tabs so no shocker here)

Then I can almost HEAR the bell go off in his head: “Wait. If I can see her conversations... oh NO. That means she can see mine. I’m so screwed and you have no idea...(mumble)” I say “I’m sorry repeat that?” “You guys at (Fruit) have no idea how bad you screwed me!”

He then demands to know how to have only his messages sync and remove hers. I reply with the only correct answer: “your girlfriend needs to sign out of your (Fruit) ID and into her own”. To which he replied “SHE IS SIGNED INTO HER OWN F*CKING (fruit) ID”. At this point I could have hung up because of the swearing but I was enjoying it too much 😂 and this made it better. Now I get to say “well, if that is in fact the case, then I’m sorry I must speak with your girlfriend then. I can only assist the account holder of the (fruit) ID with Fruit Cloud issues”

He gets even madder. I had to put him on hold because at this point I could not hold back the laughter of him realizing he’s been long caught and his gf just hasn’t confronted him yet 😂😂 then transferred him to Tier 2 (we are allowed to self escalate if “unable to gain agreement” after 5 minutes)

It was a hilarious call

I really wish I could know the tea of what happened after all that 😂",2765,0,1
Birthday Wishes,"I was just getting off work when my phone blew up with messages from my housemate. My housemate, $HM had dropped his phone and now the screen was black. It was his birthday, and he could see his phone going off with notifications wishing him happy birthday, but he couldn't access any of the texts to reply. I told him there should be a spare phone in my drawers, and that he should pop it on charge while I drove home.

When I got home we had a look at the old phone. The screen was busted, but it was still clearly working underneath. For most people this wouldn't be a problem, you could just sign in to the new phone and all your cloud saves would pull everything across, but for $HM, it was something else. $HM doesn't use ANY cloud backups. I've helped him recover a lost word file minutes before a due date three times this year, and he still isn't on OneDrive. We needed to find a way into his phone.

Since the start of this year I've been working from home. Pretty early on, I set up my home office to let me swap between my different computers using a USB A dock (which I was surprised to find out existed), and conveniently enough I still had a USB A to Micro USB cable. In one of the shonkiest workarounds I've ever pulled, we remotely installed the DisplayLink app on $HM's phone, and were able to hook it up to my dock. Now, his phone was displaying on the monitor, and he could use the mouse and keyboard to reply to all his birthday wishes.

After the messages were taken care of, we got to work moving the data across. I set $HM up with google photos and contacts, and we pulled across his mobile banking, but we hit a stumbling block. Microsoft and Google authenticators don't display over DisplayLink, as they think its a screen recording software. I started setting up SCRCPY when we ran into a hurdle. We needed to allow the phone to be used like a USB, but to connect the phone to the computer we needed to disconnect it from the display and inputs. In a feat of absolute barbarity topping the previous workaround, I ran downstairs and grabbed the Chromecast. I hooked it up to one of my monitors. Then, using the dock, we cast the screen to the Chromecast. Finally, we were able to disconnect the phone from the dock, but still see the phone's display using the Chromecast monitor.

I'd like to say that we then set up SCRCPY to let us access the phone, but it turns out android doesn't enforce the same security feature on Chromecast as it does on DisplayLink, and we were able to access the authenticators pretty easily from there.

By the end of it, it was nearly 2:30 in the morning, but he was able to go to bed with his data transferred to the spare phone, and all the birthday wishes replied to. Maybe now he'll back his stuff up to the cloud.",625,0,1
That Time I Fixed an Aircraft with Just One Finger,"A Completely Unhelpful^TM TLDR is at the bottom

My form of Tech Support is aircraft maintenance, working on fixed-wing aeroplanes and helicopters with a value ranging from mid-five-figures to mid-eight-figures. They usually can be divided into airborne aluminium pit-ponies or their owners’ pride-and-joy; even a business jet worth more than ten million dollars can be treated as a workhorse, while a 45-year-old 40-thousand-dollar bugsmasher may be pampered by its owner.
_______________________________________________________
In my last Post to TFTS, I recounted ‘fixing’ an aircraft with [just one hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/j0lys8/that_time_i_singlehandedly_fixed_an_aircraft/). Analysis of the Upvote percentage accrued by that post, combined with a perusal of the comments, has led me to take the (perhaps accurate, perhaps justifiable-but-inaccurate, perhaps preposterous - who am I to say which it is, I am not necessarily qualified) position that some readers took umbrage at my verbosity, with several opining that I could have described the events of that brief vignette somewhat more tersely than I actually did; rest assured, dear readers, that your correspondent (and also these stories’ protagonist, at least in most cases; for one of the “most liked” (for want of a better expression) posts I have submitted was my recounting of the tale [told to me by a Frenchman who spent a week in Flyover USA](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/f430vk/you_travelled_from_europe_to_do_what_now/) (and which, I want to make clear, was not in Idaho - “Bumfuck, Idaho” is just an expression used among several people of my acquaintance to denote a place that doesn’t see many visitors), so there is that) has heeded your criticisms - I undertake that, where once I may have been tempted to make a single long, difficult-to-read sentence as if I am being paid to write by-the-word or am endeavouring to create something for the American market replete with exposition others would find superfluous, I shall aim for pith; I shall be laconic rather than loquacious; I will not be garrulous, but rather shall strive for taciturnity; I will baldly state the bare facts where once I might have employed a...shall we say “Baroque”...writing style; I shan’t make cryptic-to-some and obscure-to-many-a-reader references as has been sometimes my wont, but rather - unlike Robert Underdunk Terwilliger Jr. - aim for clarity just like Mr. Odwin in the Wodeshead Retirement Home does (for who knows, maybe not doing so will result in me being one of the first up against the wall when the revolution comes, awaiting summary execution with all the mindless jerks from Marketing). 

&amp;nbsp;

I think I have [burned enough ants with a magnifying glass](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/j0lys8/that_time_i_singlehandedly_fixed_an_aircraft/g74ov6w/?context=3) now, on to the story.

&amp;nbsp;

The events I describe here took place last year. 

This story begins with my looking at the work package for an aircraft that had just been towed inside the hangar for a maintenance visit (the work package is a ring binder full of paperwork laying out what maintenance is to be done and some of the information we engineers need to follow in order to perform said maintenance - it never has everything we need in it). One of the Work Orders (WOs) in the work package said “Copilot Screen Blank” (this is verbatim - for the purposes of this Post I looked up the WO in the computerised maintenance records system that was designed for my employer and which was implemented about a dozen years ago, several years late and several hundred percent over budget).

“What is this ‘screen’ you speak of?” I hear you say. To quote Deane from *[The Curiosity Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curiosity_Show)*, “I’m glad you asked”.  The screen is part of the aircraft’s Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS, pronounced “ee-fiss”, because in aviation we love to convert our acronyms into words); this is a suite of processors and electronic displays that is found in most modern aircraft, which has taken the place of all the mechanical instruments that used to present all of the information to the pilots ([Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_flight_instrument_system)) (fun fact: many helicopters have a tuft of string attached outside the front of the windscreen; this is to show the pilot whether the helicopter is flying straight or yawing. But I digress). A single EFIS Primary Flight Display (PFD) now might have all of the information previously presented by a dozen or more separate ‘steam-driven’ instruments and indicators. In the old days, EFIS systems had small breathtakingly-expensive CRT displays; nowadays they have small breathtakingly-expensive LCD displays.

Anyhoo, as I am sure many of you have experienced in your respective IT careers - with your receipt of trouble tickets such as “printer won’t print” or “computer broken” - I was left wanting more details. As I am sure many of you have experienced in your respective IT careers, more details were unavailable, because the user (in this case the pilot) was now no longer at his workstation. A replacement PFD, if needed, would have to be shipped from overseas and would cost more than ten Northern Hemisphere [kilomonies], which would translate to even more Southern Hemisphere [kilomonies] due to the international currency trade, so it was important that I figure out what was wrong sooner rather than later. 

To this end, I entered the aircraft and powered it up. As the avionics systems initialised, I noticed that I could see information on the copilot PFD, but the display was very dim. I extended my right index finger and pressed the rocker switch in the corner of the display bezel; and the screen became fully bright. I pressed the rocker the other way and the screen returned to its erstwhile dim state. I pressed the rocker a third time until the screen was fully bright again, then I shut down power and exited the aircraft. The time elapsed between turning power on and turning it off again was about two minutes.

The PFD was only visible to me because the aircraft was inside the hangar and it was consequently quite dark in the cockpit. If the aircraft had been outside in full sunlight, the display screen would be too dim to see anything. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is the fun part (for values of ‘fun’ that include ‘fucking tedious and irritating’); once a WO is created in the computerised maintenance records system I mentioned earlier, it cannot be deleted. In addition, by Regulation, all aircraft maintenance has to be done in accordance with a documented and approved procedure; ‘how to adjust the brightness of an EFIS PFD’ was one of the pieces of required information that was not provided in the work package (we have a guy, who is paid less than an aircraft maintenance engineer, whose job it is to create the work packages). So, I then spent almost half-an-hour looking for something that told me how to press the rocker switch to brighten or dim the display; there was nothing in the aircraft maintenance manual, but I eventually found the requisite information - a single sentence in several hundred pages comprising the system’s Pilot’s Operating Guide. With more time to write up in the WO the ‘story’ of what I had done (“adjusted display brightness and system operation checked, found to be correct in accordance with [EFIS system marketing name] Pilot’s Operating Guide Section [Blah]”) added on, I ended up booking 36 minutes in the customer billing system. 

While checking the computerised system to refresh my memory for this Post, I discovered that $Colleague-who-had-nothing-to-do-with-pressing-the-switch had booked half-an-hour to the WO as well, which meant that the customer was billed 1.1 hours for me to press a button.

If all of this wasn’t done on a business jet that cost the owner several million dollars, I might be concerned about the overcharging. That’s not really my problem in the end, it’s my job to push buttons and use ink to make marks on rectangular pieces of dried wood pulp ~~while ignoring Zarniwoop making noise outside~~...

Customer: “I’m a NETWORK ENGINEER”,"Finally have something to post. Head ups it’s a novel. Kinda fits in r/amitheantagonist, too IMO. I’ve been doing tech support for a few years now, but my new job is by far the most advanced networking I’ve had to do. That being said, I’m far from a network engineer but I know my way around a computer or two. This particular instance was nowhere near the scope of work we have to handle on a normal day. 

The company I work for now sells multiple small devices that have an LED on them. These small devices require an internet connection or they will not work. The main one has to be hardwired to the modem/mrc/ont in order to send out a signal to the other small devices around your house. Like most things in technology, the LED will change colors to tell you what’s wrong. We also have an app.

White = everything is fine 
Yellow = you pressed the reset button 
Red = something is wrong 
 
This customer was over email, not the phone. Which is already a challenge as it is. We’ll call him TB Answers are shortened. 

TB: I keep getting a red light. It keeps telling me it could not get an internet connection to my ISP. It happens a lot. I have to always turn it off and turn it back on to get it to work again. First it’s the main one and then the others go red too.

Me: thanks for reaching out and sorry about the delayed response. You stated that your devices are giving you a red LED. I checked your network history and noticed that there were some outages on your ISP side. (Proceeds to ask customer general questions we ask when someone says something like this, i.e how far apart are they, how does the power cord look etc). While I’m waiting to hear back from you on that information, please go ahead and swap the device that you currently have connected to your modem and use one of the other small devices there instead. Also turn your modem off for 3 minutes and then it back on. 

TB: (Answers my general questions). No. The issue is with the device. When the red light comes on it doesn’t respond. It happens to all of them. I don’t want wanna swap them. I like them where they are. Why are they becoming unresponsive? Can I run a test other than the app? It’s useless when the red light comes on. 

Me: Thanks for getting back to me on this. The reason why the other units display a red light when the main one does is because they need the main one in order to establish a connection to the internet. If the main one is not getting internet and is showing a red light then the others will also. Please try swapping them so we can determine if something is wrong with the main device, the location or the network in general. If you don’t want to do this on your own you can give us a call so that we can help. 

TB: i understand but why is the device becoming unresponsive? When the red light is on it’s not responding. 

Me: thanks for being so patient. The red light is causing the device to be unresponsive because it is not getting an internet connection. We can start eliminating possible reasons why once you complete the swap of the devices I mentioned earlier. 

TB does not respond for 2 weeks. 
TB: I swapped them and I’ll see how it goes 

Me: Thanks for keeping me updated on this! After a day or two please let me know the results. 

TB: so far everything has been good. Switching them fixed it! Can you explain why that worked? As a consumer, what options do we have as far as figuring out what’s going on with our devices? 

Me: (explains why that worked to cx). In regard to tools you can use, the only tool that we have on our end that you don’t have access too is network history graph that shows us where the outages are coming from. We use mostly process of elimination to figure out what’s going on. (Gives cx examples of questions we ask to determine what’s going on with someone’s devices). 

TB: (literally answers the questions even though they were just examples, fair enough. I kinda walked into that one). There are no outages from my ISP. 

Me: if all of your devices are displaying red that is an indication that there is a loss of communication coming from either the ISP down to the main device or an issue with the main device communicating with the other devices in the house. I checked your history from prior to when we fixed it and noticed over 14 outages during the last few days. It could be something small like maybe they were doing work on a nearby line. Next time you get an outage, try to hardwire something else to your modem to confirm that you are not getting an internet connection in general. 

TB: when they went down all had the red light. I tried to ping the device and it wouldn’t work. When the red light comes on, the devices do not respond. This is not normal. If there is an outage from the ISP why should I lose my network? The devices are crashing.

(At this point I felt like I was literally talking to a brick wall. I really decided to dumb it down this time and repeat myself 6 times in 7 different ways). 

Me: if there is a network outage on the ISP side, that means that they can not give you wifi. As a result, your devices can not give you wifi. Therefore, you will have no network to ping. We can only give you what we are getting. Our devices are a car and your ISP is the gas. A car can not run without gas. If your main device is not getting gas, it can not drive to the other devices you have in your house. I see that there are a lot of outages coming from your ISP. If you do not want to take my word for it, if you notice an outage again, I suggest hardwiring something to the modem to test this out. If there is no internet being provided, we can not give you wifi that is not there. If there is not wifi being provided, the devices will have a red light - starting with the main one and going to the others. Once you have contacted your ISP please let us know.

TB: I am not talking about my internet access. I am talking about the network integrity. A failure at pinging the device has nothing to do with the ISP. If I can’t ping from inside my network that is a problem. The devices are crashing. Why do I have to power cycle the devices when my ISP drops? I understand that no connection to the ISP means no internet but I’m not talking about that. My devices are crashing. Give the ISP argument a test and focus on why my devices are not recovering from an ISP outage. 

Me: thanks for getting back to me on this. I understand where you are coming from. (Explains how during the set up process when you initially get the devices requires them to power cycle their modem). This is why during an ISP outage, you have to power cycle your devices. The odds of all 3 of your devices being defective are incredibly slim. However, if you refuse to speak with your ISP or refuse to try any additional troubleshooting there is nothing that we can do. You are currently still within your warranty and can get a replacement if one is found to be required. However, due to all the ISP outages, the department that approves replacements will ask you to contact your ISP. As soon as you contact your ISP please let us know.

TB: First and foremost you have not read my responses to you. If we are going to flex intellect, per the tone of your email, then let’s go ahead and do so. I have been very patient. I have only asked questions about what I observed since i am a NETWORK ENGINEER. this is not normal. The device is crashing! Facts are facts. Our app is no longer available when they crash. You can’t ping any of the devices when they go offline. You have to turn them off and back on. IS THIS NORMAL???? You have not read my responses and I DO NOT APPRECIATE YOUR TONE. I need a solution to this problem and unless there has been a product update between when I reported this issue to now the problem still exists. So regardless of your WARRANTY threat if the issue is unresolved then you are obligated to resolve it.

(At this point I feel like I’m in the twilight zone) 

Me: thanks for getting back to me on this, I appreciate you taking the time to do what you can. I apologize if my tone is being presented in a way that is not appealing. I am not able to speak with you causally and have to use certain words or phrases in response to you. As a result, I may be coming off as robotic or callous. I do indeed want to resolve this problem for you or answer any questions that you have about the device. The answer is yes it is normal that if your ISP has a drop that the devices will need to be rebooted. I agree that this can be an inconvenience. However, yes. It is normal. I would also like to assure you that I did indeed read all of your emails. 

TB: I appreciate your response but when the ISP drops, it should not be normal to have to reboot the devices. If so, I would always have to reboot my computer. If this is the case, I want to return all of them if they do not fix this even though I have had them for a year. 



All in all, I get where he was coming from but GEEZ LOUISE it took a long time to get there. 

TLDR: customer who is a “network engineer” didn’t understand that if an ISP is having a drop that their device HARDWIRED to the modem from the ISP will not have an internet connection.",165,0,1
"Just delete the outlier ""I have deleted the entire system"". WHAT?!?","Ltl;FTP

OP: Dwayne ""the rock"" Johnson

NG: New guy

To keep it safe, I will be changing a few things regarding this story as the system that will be talked about in this is fairly sensitive.

I am glorified tech support for a multi-billion dollar system run by the government. For simple issues they call my cell phone after hours but for more in-depth questions I can contact the next tier of support to figure things out. Usually I get a few calls a week that last anywhere between 5 min to an hour, but on the whole nothing serious.

One day after I get home from the office I get a call from one of the guys on skeleton crew.

NG: ""We got a problem with the graph that displays [redacted] and its giving us some trouble. Any ideas?""

 After about 30 seconds its obvious there was a bad data point that was throwing off the auto generated limits of the graph, a simple fix. (It should be noted at this time that usually the guys running the system are trained to know how to fix this stuff, but if theyre new to the job, like in this case, they are afraid of breaking anything so at the first sign of a problem they call us for hand holding. Im not against this policy, but if i get calls from the same person after a few months I start to take notice.) The person in question had been there for a few weeks so he didnt know for sure what to do, so I helped him.

OP: ""Its easy, just exclude the bad data point and we'll be back on track. I'll stay on the line as you do it.""

NG: ""Understood.""

3 min go by in silence. Then, I hear words I did not expect to hear.

NG: ""Its still going on. Are you sure this was the right fix?""

OP: ""It was for the last 5 times I did it. Walk me through what you did.""

He tells me what he did and it all sounds correct until the last step.

NG: ""... then i got all the points outside the normal range and excluded them.""

OP: ""Wait, all the points? I thought it was just one, how many are there?""

NG: ""20,000""

OP: ""wut""

NG: ""I excluded 20,000 points. I dont see the graph anymore"".

OP: ""Thats because you just told the system to disregard all data for the last 2 weeks.""

NG: Silence ""Is that bad?""

OP: ""Well it ain't great. I'll be there in an hour"".

I wasnt well versed on this particular subsystem to know the extent of the damage, but eventually I get the expert on this particular subsystem up to speed on the issue and we head in at 8pm, well after closing time for us dayshift workers. We get to the new guy and he shows us what he did. The expert asks to take control and 10 seconds and 3 mouse clicks later everything is back to normal. 

Turns out the new guy didnt set parameters for the exclusion and just deleted everything, but there is a backup for this exact scenario. The expert was super chill about the whole thing and chalked it up to a learning experience. Bought him coffee the next day, dude earned it.",1924,0,1
I don't trust anyone who responds to emails at the speed of light.,"Working on a client request to upload some contacts into his account (CRM tech support). Pretty standard.

For some quick context, we can upload as many contacts as you want, but it obviously takes longer depending on how many are in your file. Also, to upload contact files from a spreadsheet, we have to assign the spreadsheet columns to fields in the system using our little upload program. Which means that clients are supposed to put their contacts' info in relevant columns - one column each for the name, phone number, email address, ect. 

This client in particular was feeling a little frisky that day.

* Had over 20k contact records. Thanks, I hate it.
* File was a mess. Names in the ""Phone Number"" column, random strings of text in the ""Email"" column, bits of address info just scattered throughout the entire thing. It was as if Jackson Pollock had a fight with Microsoft Excel and won. No way the upload tool was going to accept it.
* Half these contacts didn't have names or contact info, just descriptions. Contacts do have to have at least a first or last name in order to be uploaded. 
* Ticket titled ""URGENT"" (automatically puts you in my personal Sinner's Queue as last priority)

So I send a detailed email letting him know everything wrong with the file and what he needs to fix before it can be uploaded. Close ticket, X out of ticket, move on to other work.

Before I'm able to actually move on to anything else, I see a ticket reopened notification in my inbox. Guess who.

""Yes please upload the contacts as specified, it is very urgent thank you."" 

I squint at the timestamp on the ticket. 32 seconds between me closing the case and him responding. My dude either has some wild thumb speed or he responded with his mind. I wait about 30 minutes before replying back with the obligatory ""per my last email"" and copy/paste my response.

30 minutes in the Sinner's Queue didn't cool him off, as he responded around 25 seconds later.

""Contacts are exactly how I want them now please upload, it is very important""

I go to lunch for an hour. Return and reply back letting him know that I physically can't upload his contacts until he makes the changes I asked for.

44 seconds later, ""I looked over the file before I sent it, everything looks good, I want this uploaded immediately"" 

It's at this point that he goes into Level 2 of the Sinner's Queue while I get to other tickets/calls. Level 2 means you might get a reply from me by end of day, if not, I'll get to you tomorrow sometime. Please find something to do other than refresh your inbox every half second.

At some point, Speedy sent in three or four new tickets to the queue, all just 20-30 seconds to a minute apart angsting about his contacts not being uploaded. A coworker of mine finds them, and sees that I was already working with him. We chat a bit, and she figures she'll respond in the hopes of hearing the same thing from two different people might knock some sense into him. She also included a screenshot of my email, highlighting the bits detailing the changes we need and the reasons for them.

Shockingly, Speedy doesn't respond for *three whole motherfuckin' minutes.* Maybe the downs finally kicked in.

""I did not see that part I am sorry. I will look at this and get back to you.""

The first line of my email said something along the lines of ""Hi, \[Customer\], I was trying to upload your file, but there are a few changes we'll need you to make first."" I can only guess that he read this line and just stopped processing inputs altogether.

TL;DR: Chucklefuck prides himself in responding to emails faster than he can mentally process them.",2813,1,1
"""I've used it on iPhones so i'm sure i'll get the hang of it""","It's a nice sunny Thursday morning in October. The birds are singing, the sun is shining, and the kettle is whistling...

Who am i kidding, it's pissing down with rain and we've run out of milk.

With the outside world, and my coffee, looking blacker than my soul, my boss turns around to bless us with good news. 

""Did you hear that Carys up in admin has asked for a Macbook?"" she asked me.

""No, why the heck does she need a Macbook?"" I reply, with a great  deal of skeptism.

You see, much like many other government-run establishments, we're very heavily invested in Microsoft, with an AD network, domain, and site-wide deployment of Windows 10. Macs are not on our RADAR, and i'm the only person in the IT department who uses one on a regular basis. There's no way in hell i want one of these things on the network though. I use a Mac so i'm not reminded of work. 

""Carys is struggling to edit videos on her iPhone, so she's asked for a Mac. Apparently it's all authorised and just needs ordering and picking up from Lewis John's"" replies my boss, with an equal amount of exasperation. 

""As long as it doesn't come out of our budget, and we're not expected to support it, sure."" 

My boss agrees, ""Yeh, we're not going to be putting it on the network, that's just opening a whole can of worms""

""I mean, we *can* put it on the network, but i don't think Carys will get on with it when we wipe it and put Windows 10 on it instead"" I reply, definitely not hiding the evil chuckle. ""where'd they get the money for all this anyway, i thought we were strapped for cash? How is it i can't have £3k to put into buying SSDs for all our deployed computers, but magically there's £2k to spend on a Macbook for one person?""

""Beats me"" my boss replies, ""i'm sure they'll pull it out of some random budget somewhere""

""As long as it's not ours...""

After resigning ourselves to the fact that we're going to be getting a Mac, something in the back of my mind reminds me of one i saw somewhere else.

You see, i was lying when i said we had no Macs. We did, indeed have one singular Mac Pro in one department, which has been languishing unused for the best part of a decade. I mention this to my boss, who then does the needful and informs Carys of the newfound fruitputer. 

Now this thing is positively ancient. It's an original cheesegrater Mac Pro, running Core2Duo era Xeons, and boots Mac OS X Lion, so this thing probably hasn't been updated since it was donated to the department it was found in. Buuut, crucially, it has iMovie on it, which is what Carys wanted to edit her videos on. 

I get the green light to move this thing up to Carys' office. But firstly, i want to quickly run updates on it, to at least get the Lion install somewhere close to up-to-date. I've not upgraded the OS out of fear of breaking iMovie. I put a reasonably modern browser on it, crack the administrator password, and run the updates, before dismantling the beast and sticking it on the trolley.

I lumber up the corridors, catch the lift to the next floor, being careful not to smash up this almost antique Mac, along with polycarbonate keyboard, Mighty Mouse, and an Apple Display with bezels the size of a childs forearm. I'm weaving in and around staff, door frames, multi-function copiers and random furniture like it's an obstacle course, before i arrive outside Carys' office.

As i'm setting this behemoth of aluminium and dispair, Carys keeps commenting on how it's such a nice machine and how it will make it so much easier to edit her videos. I'm just nodding and agreeing, thankful that i've save the organisation around £3k by repurposing this boat anchor. 

After it's all set up, i start explaining to her that it's a bit old and it might have a few issues here and there.

""Sorry to say, this thing is a bit older, and as such runs Mac OS Lion, but iMovie is there, so it should work for your purposes. Some things on more modern MacOS won't be there, but you should be fine"" 

""Oh that doesn't matter, I've used iMovie on iPhones,  i'm sure i'll get the hang of it"" she replies, ""I've never used a Mac before anyway""",1400,0,1
"""It doesn't really that way"" (but I could make it work another)","At my company there is actually a very good relationship between the business stakeholders and us technical design and operations people. We recognise that the business can't succeed if they can't sell stuff, and they recognise that the business can't succeed if they sell stuff that doesn't work or even exist.

Occasionally, bless 'em, the business stakeholders will come to me with a fully fleshed out solution, upon which four milliseconds of consideration will determine falls into one of the two latter categories.

It is thus that, when describing my role in the business to newbies, I am wont to describe it as ""I tell people 'No, sorry, it doesn't really work like that.'"" But the important corollary to this description is that I then try to follow up with ""So what is it you're actually trying to *achieve?*"" and offer an alternative solution that gets them (close enough to?) what they want, whilst still allowing Hawking and Turing to sleep peacefully in their graves.

My wife works in another not-quite-competitor in the broader industry. She really likes her old boss, and I've met him a couple of times. They've even been to our place for dinner. When I first met him and we were chatting, I described my job to him.

One day later he told her about a business analyst friend of his who he had been talking with earlier in the week. He had previously worked at my company and was considering coming back as he wasn't enjoying his current job as much. He said ""We used to come up with these amazing solutions that would get everyone exactly what they wanted. But then we would have to go and present them to this one guy in the core network design team. He would shake his head and say no, it didn't work like that. And then he'd tell us how it *was* going to work, and we'd throw it all away and start again.""

Old boss says ""Oh, you mean /u/ExParrot1337."" 

""...Yes! How do you know him?""

""I'm his wife's boss.""

The secret, people, is not to just tell people ""no"", but to add a ""... *but*"".",267,0,1
Amazing colleagues and technology,"Okay, I do have to clarify this first: I work at a small company without a dedicated tech support. Since I know enough about computers to fix small issues, my amazing colleagues and boss tend to rely on me for first line tech support, though I reiterate that technically I am paid for my regular work.  


That said, I recently had a real gem of a situation that I'd like to share. The thing is, my colleagues and boss are amazing, in that they are amazingly bad at computers beyond using a browser and basic office software like word. Good people, but they combine ignorance with an unwillingness to learn, so that even the simplest issues require me to fix it. Usually after hours as with the current pandemic I and a few others work from home. Not to rail on the office, but the work pc's there are old W7 upgrades over 5 years old and they are due for replacing asap.   


As part of the business, one of my office-working colleagues has to print a lot of invoices for even less tech-savvy customers. For this, let's call her Hannyabal as she has a similar personality and grimace.  Basically, the big printer was running out of ink so I went in and raided the storage for a fitting new toner cartridge... But we were out of that particular one. One quick order later I'm primed to install it at the earliest convenience, but Hannyabal had a bright idea: she could take the delivered toner cartridge and put it in herself. Without telling me ofc. Then:  


H: Hey you, the printer isn't working! You ordered the wrong ink for it!   
me: What are you talking about? I'm due to install the new toner later today.  
H: I'm tired of waiting, so I put the new one in. Its that crap \[housebrand\] ink. You need to fix it!  
me: Did you put it in correctly? You didn't throw away the drum? (again)  
H: Of course! But its not my job, you need to fix it, I've got a big run to do tomorrow! Order some proper ink or I'll complain to (overworked) boss!  


So, I went to the office, retrieved the printer (from the floor!) and looked in wonder. She had in fact managed to take the old toner out and put the new one in. HOWEVER: she had left on all the sealing/packaging materials. The connector ports to the printer couldn't rotate, the toner reservoir was still 'locked' with the seal tab and it had not pegged into the drum properly. Fixed in less than 3 minutes, 3 test prints made (the old toner had dripped on the ink-transfer a bit) and wahoo... its done. Literally, anyone could have done it had they bothered to take a look. Hannyabal was quiet for a while after I informed her of the need to remove these things.  


Frankly, it is times like this that I have the utmost respect for people who work tech support fulltime. They have to deal with this crap daily and with a multitude of weird/rude/idiotic people. I just have to deal with colleagues who are practically technophobes and extremely unhelpful when trying to be 'helpful'. If I can get them and the boss to let the anti-virus run occasionally, to let that update and not to let kids (boss) play internet games on them before I'm fitted with a pinewood overcoat, I'll be happy.",163,0,1

"Oh I think I found the problem, you have a bad last name.","So this is a fun one I got a few days ago. New hire calling in stating her starting password did not work. Usually these things can be user error from the end user or the account creation side.

&gt; $Me - Are you at the windows login screen or the citrix login screen?  
&gt; $Her - Windows.    

I pull up her account and find the new hire spreadsheet. It has each new hire, their email, and one time use password on it. 

&gt; $Me - Can you tell me which PW you are using?  

We can not give out passwords over the phone so I have them tell me their password.

&gt; $her - Parker4545%

AD gives me an error. Invalid password. 

&gt; $Me - Strange, it wont let me use that password for some reason. Trying again. 

Again AD tells me invalid password. Strange because this is just a variation of one of many password templates at the company. 

&gt; $Me - One moment while I reach out to an admin regarding this. 

I pull up teams and reach out to account admin. He tried resetting it himself and got the same thing. He pulls in another account admin and gets the same thing. We escalate up to the exchange admin in case its an issue with desynching. He checks everything and he cant figure it out either. 

This chat is getting larger and larger until the sysadmin joins in. 

&gt; $Sysadmin - Well you see guys, the reason you are unable to reset Ms Park's password to Parker4545% is because IT HAS HER LAST NAME IN IT!!!

The chat was silent for roughly 10 seconds and was quickly filled with gifs of people stating they are dumb or gifs of people smashing things into their heads. 

&gt; $Me - Ms Park? (Again fake name)     
&gt; $Her - Yes?  
&gt; $Me - We found the issue.   
&gt; $Her - Oh good. What was it?  
&gt; $Me - Your last name is park. We were trying to set your password to parker, which has your name in it, and that is why it wasn't working.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks ago I come back from vacation and immediately get flooded by calls, that the schools PCs can't log into the internet and that this needs to be fixed immediately so the teachers can teach their computer science classes...

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, first I decide to take a look at the PCs. I walk over to the closest computer room, and check the cables there. Switch is blinking so I rule out someone tripping over the power cord or similar. I sit down at a PC and do the usual ipconfig and pings.

Turns out DNS server is not responding. \*frown\*

I panic a little bit and bolt towards the head office. My boss is there and she's relieved to see me. I ask her what happened during my vacation and tell her I just found out, there's no more server in the broom closet. 

Oh, right, the central admin was here last friday and did something to the server but he didn't tell me what it was...

&amp;#x200B;

So I make a call and get the assistant of the central admin who tells me that they set up the server in another room because fire regulations etc.

I get to the new server room and to my relief there it is, humming along and clearly connected to the network.

&amp;#x200B;

I ponder for a second and decide to take a closer look. I haul a monitor and some peripherals to the room and get greeted with a black screen. I boot up again and then I see the problem.

The boot sequence was set to boot from the external HD which didn't have any data whatsoever.

I set it to boot from internal HD first and unplug the external for good measure. Lo and behold the server is back up again and running. I connect the external again and all is well.

I trust you,"tldr at the bottom

I told this story to my wife and made her laugh so I decided it might be worth sharing here.

A little background, I work at an NGO as a social worker. I also like building PCs and Networks during my free time, which got me promoted to local admin at work (came with a small payraise though!)

One day I get a call from a coworker. She's a really great social worker but not very tech savvy.

Call goes as follows:

Me = Me

Coworker = Coco

Coco: Hi, Nocuras8, do you know zoom?

Me: Yeah, I've participated in some meetings with this app so how can I help you? *(my mind starts going through common problems with these apps, like a deactivated camera or mic, connection issues etc.)*

Coco: Great, I knew you could help me. So there's this girl from a local university and she wants to do an interview with me over zoom. However I can't log in somehow. We tried troubleshooting it ourselves but when I try the steps she tells me to do it's not doing the same as on her PC. She even sent me a picture how it looks like on her end but I don't even get there.

Me: OK. We'll try and find the step where it goes south and try to find out why. So first you should have an invitation, a link probably in the first mail this girl sent you.

Coco: Yes there are some links. Which one should I click?

Me: Uh, it should be labeled ""invitation"" or ""join"" or something similar and look like ""\[link\]"".

Coco: OK I clicked it and a browser opened but nothing happens. You know what, it says I should not share the mail with someone else but I trust you. I'll send it to you.

Me: Ok I'll have a look. *(Get the mail, click the link, everything works fine)*

Me: Alright it seems to work for me so it might be your browser blocking a pop-up. Do you have any antivirus/anti-anything installed that could stop it from working?

Coco: I have Norton but nothing else.

Me: Good, let's check your browser. *(I navigate her to where she'd be able to see if there was any pop-ups blocked)*

Coco: No, there are no messages, no apps called adblocker or noscript...

Me: Alright, then we'll try it again but really slow and you tell me everything you see before we continue with the next step. First click on the invitation link again and tell me exactly what error your browser displays.

Coco: There's no error but it says ""your download will start shortly""

Me: Great, that's a step in the right direction. Do you see your download?

Coco: No, I pressed ""Cancel"". I don't want any untrusted files on my PC!

*Head meets desk.*

Me: Uh, you kinda need to download the app first to log into it.

Coco: Ah, I see. So the girl from university had a different screen because she already has the app?

Me: Yeah, you could say that. So You want this to work now or not?

Coco: Yeah the interview is scheduled for tomorrow and I even took a day off work to do this. So, I need to actually download this file?

Me: Yeah apparently you need to download the file to start the app.

Coco: OK I trust you, so what do I do?

Me: Click the link again but this time do not cancel. Just press ""save file"" instead.

Coco: Huh, it's doing something! Ah, there's the screen the girl showed me. Ok logging in. Aw, it's still not working. Says they updated their privacy form and...

Me: Just click accept and it should continue.

Coco: Ok I trust you, I clicked it but now there's a whole bunch of browser windows I don't know where they came from...

Me: Hm, were you able to click accept?

Coco: There is no accept just some links...

Me: Alright I think now I actually need a picture of your screen because I have no idea what is happening right now.

Coco: Oh, I know how to do this. My boyfriend showed me!

*So I get a screenshot with lots of clutter open and one clearly visible window from the app, that has the aforementioned text, some links so you can view the privacy agreement etc. in a browser and a big blue button labeled ""CONTINUE"".*

*I ponder for a while and then get back on the phone.*

Me: Yeah, so, do you still have your screen just like in the picture you sent me?

Coco: Yes, exactly like it.

Me: Then close the following windows *(proceeds to list about a dozen apps running that she definitely doesn't need at all)*

Coco: Will that make it work?

*(Me: No, but it'll make me feel better.)*

Me: Yeah, that and clicking on that big, bright blue button that says ""Continue"".

Coco: Oh my god! It worked. I can see myself on screen! I knew I could trust you!

Me: Always glad I can help.

Your software allows me to enter the wrong numbers,"This customer had been complaining for months about incorrect numbers in our software concerning deposit amounts. They were always off, she tells us, and each time we call we ask for some specifics so we can investigate. She never sends us anything and just waits about a week and calls again. Finally, though, she's ready to speak with someone and I'm bored so I decide to call her back and deal with it.

After a few confusing minutes with her I realize that the numbers in question are the daily and monthly deposit variance numbers. She scans and emails be a few examples that have the ""Actual Deposit"" number crossed out and then a number hand written. She explains that the ""Actual Deposit"" numbers are wrong and that the hand written numbers are her corrections. She wants to know why those numbers are never correct and are sometimes off by a huge margin.

Her question is, where to the ""Actual Deposit"" numbers come from and how can we make them correct. This is where I explain that the person closing out for the day is the one that enters those numbers, right before this report prints. She tells me that she's the one who does that and that my explanation makes no sense because she'd know if she were the one entering those numbers. I have her do a test. If you reprint a report for a previous day you have the option of entering these numbers again and overwriting the originals.

She prints the report and I ask her what she entered when asked for the deposit amounts. She tells me that the numbers are different this time, though. I ask her to do it one more time and to stop at each step, selecting the report, selecting the date, entering deposit amounts, clicking the print button. She pauses for me at the report selection, date selection, and then I hear some keys quickly typed, and then she pauses before clicking the print button. I ask her what that typing was and she tells me she really doesn't know. A window pops up and she has to type a bunch of numbers and hit Enter a few times to make it go away. WTF?

For months now she's been flying by these fields without even reading the prompts. It turns out she was new to this position and nobody trained her, but seriously spending 30 seconds reading the screen would have solved this from day 1. I don't even know what to think of this because she didn't care enough to read a popup form asking for deposit amounts, but she was counting the deposits and handwriting the daily figures. She clearly cared about accuracy but not enough to read?

After I explain all this to her she gets a little upset and asks why our software lets her enter the wrong numbers every day. She tells me a computer should be able to detect that the numbers are wrong and warn her. It just never sinks in to her that the purpose of these fields is to allow her to hand count the deposits and enter them so that over / short can be calculated. We end the call with her believing the software is at fault and that she will have to continue hand writing the correct deposit amounts. At least she never calls back about it.",1456,0,1
NEVER press the shiny red button!!! System upgrade turns into a robbery in progress,"TL;DR at bottom

Back again for another tale of insanity and tech woe’s that dances on the border between stupidly impossible and yet somehow plausible. I was on my way to work tonight and had a pair of cop cars goes flying past me and it reminded me of this story.

This was back around early 2005-6ish, at this time I have about 8 years of experience under my belt and I’m pretty confident in what I know and what I don’t and the difference between the two. I’ve installed/upgraded several network setups and phone systems by this point and I’m fairly confident I know how to pull cables and remove the old crap that has been dry rotting for years in the ceilings and walls. This particular job was a network upgrade to replace the old network drops and land line phone switch system and install IP phones along with a new network switch for the recent fiber upgrade they got. The network “closet” was a 4’x4’ graveyard filled with junk systems, two old phone punch down panels, dead battery backups, and the current systems I was replacing.

This customer was in a small strip mall area that had nice high drop ceilings so install and removal of the old garbage was fairly easy. Cut the old junk at the top of the wall yank it back to the closet, cut it up top, pull the loose junk away from the old systems. I get all the old crap off the wall and loaded into my vehicle to scrap/recycle and started pulling the new cables. I got all the new cables pulled and punched down out in the office.

I wanted to be out of the customer’s way so I decided to setup the new phones and run cables to all the new equipment before finishing the closet. I’m crawling underneath the counters and desks organizing the system cables, my OCD couldn’t let the rat nests alone, while pulling the new cables through.

As I’m under the front counter I come across a small box with a single red button….

*HMM, what could this be I wonder???*

I asked the owner if they knew what this curiosity was and they said they didn’t know. I said it looks like a panic button to call the cops if you were getting robbed and asked if they had a system like that. To the owners knowledge they did not and I had everything out of the closet and nothing I pulled looked like a system like that, they’re usually a wall mounted metal box that’s locked with wires running through metal conduit for protection. I asked if they wanted it left or pulled and they said pull it so I unmounted it, yanked the wires back up through the wall, tossed a wire nut on each of the ends to be safe, coiled it up, and zip tied it to a support beam.

*Obviously I had to press the big red shiny button before pulling it, it’s against the law not press it.*

I want to say about 10-15 minutes pass and I’m currently still under the last station, where the button was, tidying up cables when I hear the familiar sound of police sirens. My first thought was, that can’t be what I think it is… there was no system in the closet… The sirens are get much louder so I pop up from under the station just in time to see two cop cars come screeching to a halt in front of the store.

*OH SHIT!!! I’m in trouble…*

Luckily the owner was much more curious then I was and was already at the front door. She walked outside and one of the officers came over the loud speaker.

Cop=cop
O=owner

Cop: Don’t move!

O: OK!

The second cop had gotten out of his vehicle and was standing beside it ready to draw his side arm.

Cop: Who are you? We got a report of a robbery in progress at this address!

O: I’m the owner of this business, there is no robbery going on. Who called you?

At this point the first officer gets out of his vehicle and approached the owner, cop 2 still standing at the ready. The cop and owner talk for a few minutes and finally he signals cop 2 that it's ok. Cop 2 approaches and all three come inside.

At this point I want to crawl into my tool bag and hide because I know this happened because of that damn button.

Cop 1 explains that an automated system called 911 saying robbery in progress at current address and they needed to take a look around to verify everything was cool. Cop 2 takes a look around as cop 1 checks with dispatch. Apparently the system was calling ever couple of minutes stating the same thing. I explained what most likely happened and ask if it's ok for me to trace the wire I left in the ceiling. By this time cop 2 comes back with an all clear and cop 1 says he will contact dispatch and let them know he's remaining on site till we can find what's making the 911 call. Cop 2 takes off and I start tracing this wire, thank god for wire tone probes. I scamper back up to the wire, hook up my tone box and try and see exactly where this wire is going. Two ladder climbs later and I find the wire is going next door to another business, thankfully owned by the same owner but the other business was run by her son. A half dozen ladder climbs later I find the wire running to a locked metal box in the ceiling above the network closet in the second business. Thankfully the key was hanging in the lock, I know real secure, so I pop it open and hit the kill switch. Cop 1 checks in with dispatch about 5 minutes later and they say calls have stopped.

*THANK GOD!!!*

The owner apologized for the trouble and I do the same, I kept saying sorry the whole time I was tracing the wire, I think the cop was tired of hearing it as he verified with dispatch asked the owner to sign some paperwork, and took off.

The nightmare was over and I asked the owner what she wanted done with the ""alarm system"". She asked if I knew how it worked and how to reset it. I did not and said it looked like it had been here a while, I could try and find info on it but no guarantees. She opted to just have me pull it out. As I was removing it I got curious to  what phone line the system was even using haven been hiding in the ceiling for so long, how did it have a live number to use? So I grabbed my handy old fashion land line phone and dial my cell phone. Turns out it was tied into the line her sons business was using as a fax line. The system was plugged into an outlet above the ceiling, I'm guessing this was installed a while back when it was another business was at this location. Turns out the two offices were originally one large office and the owner had a wall installed in between. She kept the counters on her side so the button never got found.

I replaced all the loose ceiling tiles on both businesses, finished the last station I was under when we got ""raided"", finished up all the work left in the network closet, and called it a day. It was interesting explaining why it took so long to do the call to my boss, I was branded the ""office criminal"" for about three weeks...

*yay! -.-*

TL;DR: Was doing a network upgrade, found a red button that no one knew what it did, I pressed it and ended up calling the cops on myself.",2031,0,1
"Karen and the ""lost"" iPad","This story is about a call I just encountered while working phone support. I know what you must all be thinking, I must get these types of calls a lot, however, it is very rare to get these types of calls at my work. I work as internal IT support for $BigCompany. However, I am not employed by $BigCompany, instead I am employed by $TechCompany and work as a contractor for $BigCompany. (This is semi relevant to the story.)

Now, on to the story, to preface, $Karen, is our main subject. The type of person you hope never calls your support line as long as you shall live. She does not work for $BigCompany. She does not work for $TechCompany, either. And then there's $Me who is yours truly.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a nice calm Wednesday. For the most part, it's been calm, I've been watching YouTube and waiting for calls most of the morning, nothing has broken, so it's pretty empty in the ticket queues as well as on phones. While I was enjoying my video, I receive a call.

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: Hi, thank you for calling the $BigCompany service desk, how can I help you?

$Karen: Hi, my husband and I are scavengers and find things that we can fix up and sell. I found an iPad on the side of the road. It looks like it's brand new and hasn't been set up. It looks like it's managed by $BigCompany. Can you remove the software that manages this device?

$Me: Unfortunately, this is not something that I can do as that software is installed specifically to keep our information safe, and therefore, we are unable to remove this software.

$Karen: But I need to get into the iPad.

$Me: Do you work for $BigCompany?

$Karen: No...

$Me: Then I can not help you. This number is for $BigCompany employees only.

$Karen: But I need to get into this iPad! (a little bit angrier this time.)

$Me: Okay, and how did you find the iPad?

$Karen: Someone threw it away, along with their backpack and laptop and some other items that have the $BigCompany name on it, as well as the person's name that this belongs to.

At this point, I was a little confused because who ""throws away"" their backpack with their work belongings in it? I'm currently thinking that this was stolen by $Karen, so I try to get the name of who this belongs to.

$Me: Okay, can I get the person's name so that I can reach out to them and confirm what has happened?

$Karen: No.

$Me: Excuse me?

$Karen: No I can not give you their name, I just need to get into this iPad.

$Me: I'm sorry, but I can not do that. It sounds like this device was lost or stolen. I need to get the name of the person that appears on those items.

$Karen: I told you, it was thrown away, they don't need it anymore. Just remove the software already! Your story is bullshit. Someone threw this away. You need to be responsible. Somebody threw away a perfectly good iPad. What are you going to do to make this right?

$Me: Nothing? Like I said, I am unable to do anything here. I'm sorry. Even if someone did throw this away, we have well over 10,000 employees. I can't be responsible for each and every individual that works for $BigCompany.

Now, I'm interested because I know that I have a Karen calling in. Finally, after 2 years of working here, I get to hear how crazy people actually are.

$Karen: That's bullshit. You need to take responsibility. This is a perfectly good computer! Throwing it away is hurting the environment! $BigCompany needs to be responsible for this! To make this right, you're going to get me into this iPad so that I can keep it and use it for myself!

$Me: That still isn't happening.

$Karen: Listen here you little shit! This is not okay, you are responsible for this! You need to make this right! Your employee threw it away!

$Me: Ma'am, I don't even work for $BigCompany

$Karen: Yes you do! You said that this is the $BigCompany service desk

$Me: That is correct ma'am, however, I don't even work for %BigCompany. I work for $TechCompany. $BigCompany just contracts out $TechCompany to do their IT for them.

$Karen: You're lying! You just made that bullshit story up just to not give me the information! Give me the information now or else I'll be talking to your manager! $BigCompany is going to go down when they see how poorly they care for the environment!

$Me: Whatever lady, you're being incredibly rude and I don't need to be talked to this way. Have a nice day. \*click\*

Yes. I did actually hang up on her immediately after, and all I heard from there was screaming. I reported this to our security team, and Karen did call back a few times. I had informed my teammates what had happened, and one of them even told me she called back in telling him what I did at the end of the call, and telling him that she wasn't working for $BigCompany, but she needed to talk to my manager. Luckily, he saw what had happened, and just hung up on her. Another coworker got her again, this time he heard angrily say something along the lines of ""What the hell is going on with this support number?!"" He immediately hung up as he saw caller ID and my message explaining the whole thing.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Karen likely stole an iPad and then called internal tech support for the company it belonged to asking to get in. I tell her no. She begins to yell and scream at me, calling my ""stories"" bullshit and I end up hanging up on her.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Not too big of an update, but I did hear back the end result of this issue. She was contacted by our security team, they were able to arrange a pickup with her. She was noted to be nasty and vile in the security report as well. We ended up getting the assets but she wanted some sort of reward for her doings. According to the report, she apparently looked tweaked out so it's likely that this was a stolen item. Anyway, thank you all for reading! It's not the longest or always the most interesting.",435,0,1
Null Island,"I'm a web developer, and I'm currently working on a project that involves a Google Maps module which displays data points for thousands of trials of Canadian farming data. The other day, we imported the most recent data sheets, and noticed that there was one pin that was obviously incorrect - all of our data points should be in Canada, and this one was in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa.

My colleague took a look at the data, and found that the data the client had provided was missing a lat and long for this trial. So, the trial was showing up on [Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island) (which is not in fact an island, but rather a lone buoy that marks the intersection of the equator and the prime meridian, or 0°,0°).",306,0,1
Never to experienced to make mistakes...,"This happened to me today.. 

My background.. I've worked tech support for the last 25 years, most of it in some senior role, I've trained people, been working helpdesk specific for the last 3 years after leaving the call center gigs.

In the last several months we've also been having an issue with our Lenovo laptops with about a 5% failure rate on the webcams. In the last 50 or so deployments, we've had to replace 3 webcams for hardware failure, the on site techs tell us it's a pretty high failure rate.

The story..

We've transitioned to purely laptops for users at our site, seemed like overkill when we started last year, but been a life saver for our staff since Covid, and now we have 3/4 staff working from home. We've sorted out our bandwidth issues and allowed users to use video during teams, they like it.

We brought in a new hire as we do sometimes, and i reimage the computer from her predecessor, install a bunch of specialized software for their position and hand it off. First hour of training i get a call, webcam is not working. \*smacks head\* I forgot to check if the camera is working, failure rate is high enough i should have checked.  

No worries, i get them a temp laptop so they can get through new hire training with a webcam, and start a ticket with Lenovo. Since it took so long to install on their software, i decide they can keep the busted computer and bring it for repair when we get the parts, instead of spending another 4 hours installing software on a second computer. They already need to come back in to get a headset anyway.

It look longer than expected but lenovo came back to me for contact information and confirm my diagnosis.  Is it in device manager, yes, i'm not an idiot. Did you try reinstalling the OS, yes, we started with a fresh install and ran all driver/bios updates. Are any privacy settings enabled, we don't pre-enable any privacy settings that would impact camera app or teams. Is the shutter turned off? Shutter, what shutter, there's not shutter, I say to myself. Erring on the side of caution i pull up the manual and learn there is indeed a shutter. I happen to have the same model so i look at it, and for the first time since i've had this computer i notice a shutter slide.

I reached out to the user, explained where to find the slide and ask if its enabled, they said it was, they slid it open, tested teams, and their camera works fine.

B:\WINDOWS\,"It just happened today. I changed my flair to reflect that.  
%ME%: The persion who made this post.  
%3.5%: A floppy lover.  

I do internal tech support in a large tech company (AKA repairing other people's computers). Not many people bother me since I am the final tier (2) and the employees are tech-savvy enough to reinstall the OS in order to get a job (Yes, they literally need to reinstall Windows to prove they can use a computer).  
Today at 3AM, the constant ringing of my phone woke me up. I picked up the phone. The person (%3.5%) on the other end asked me to do something. I was still very sleepy, so I completely ignored his raging. I found a ticket on my queue. It was an urgent one, which means that I have to do it now.  
So I rode my bike to the nearest bus stop, and got on the night bus, which was horribly empty. Finally it arrived, and I walked for a while in this dead city. When I went to his home, he told me that his work computer ceased to work (as if it was not unhelpful enough already). Sure, it boots, but the Windows Boot Manager cannot find the drive specified.  
I took out the recovery USB, plugged it in, disabled Secure Boot (they have no CSM?!), and booted up the rescue CD (image). The GPT is fine, the partitions are all there, efivars are all right, so it should boot...wait. It is Windows. I booted up Windows PE. Well, the RNG is not on my side. I (virtually) rolled an 1 and BCDBOOT does not work. I assumed that it was fscked up beyond repair. So I run BOOTICE and recreated the BCD as it should be. I (virtually) rolled an 1 again and it still cannot find drive C.  
I tried lots of things like checking his drive and run sfc, no result.  
I recalled that there is a Microsoft article to get the C drive back, so I dig into the registry, and sure, the problem is there: the C drive is pointed to a USB, and there are entries of A: and B:.  
Being confused, I boot it up again, sure it boots, but it cannot load a driver which is located at drive B.

&gt;
%Me%: Where did you install Windows?  
%3.5%: In drive B. After I installed Windows, I used an ~~arcane~~ old tool to mount the ESP as A: and the Windows partition as B:.  
%Me%: Why would you do that?  
%3.5%: You know the letters start at A, right? Microsoft gets it wrong.  

Finally, the morning sun has vanquished the horrible night. I backed up all his files, and performed a ~~purge~~ reinstallation.  
Quest completed. I got less than 1 gold and 0 EXP.

Yeah sure I'll wipe everything,"Hey all.

Time for another story.

This is a recent one and I have retold it to alot of people.

So our company hosts alot from other companies and provide hardware/software/rdp/Citrix/office support and people mainly mail in their issues and orders to our ticket system.

I was bored and had a look over our order que and noticed one that seemed easy.

""My Citrix is really slow!""

Sure I figured I'll have a look soni went in to the profile on the host and clicked around checking folder sizes and whatnot.

Oh  600 MB space is what the customer has in the first 4 folders he has taken up space of around 2 Gigs.

I hook up my headset and call him up.

Me$: Hi this is $Merentis from $Techco I have had a look and I noticed you have alot of things stired in your documents pictures folder aswell as theese folders. 

$Client: okay? Fix it.

$Me: pardon?

$client: fix it remove what I dont need and fix it. *click*

I put my headset back down and ponder before grinning like a madman. 


Most of the time we dont dont do this since it'll take time and we wont be able to help out on other things and well you know what some people have on what they think is a private storage biy I had a plan to be an ass.



So I take a few moments prep a folder on the shared network drive and move everything there as a backup no real danger to fill anything up there.

And sit back sipping coffee doe a while before hitting the delete button.

As soon as I did I threw out a message on Teams to my team ""If $client from $Corp calls transfer him to me.""

It takes a short while and I get to work on a mother ticket closing down a few accounts before I get the number of someone flashing a callback to me.

$me ""welcome to $Itcompany this is $Merentis how maybe help?""

$client ""Where is my documents?! I had a bill for $largercorp""

$Me : well sir it's on the shared network drive and only with you able to access it. I removed it from your Citrix session so you wouldn't have issues with long login times.""

$client "" Why cant you just remove the things i dont need?!""

Me$ ""because if I did sir I would have to look at every file in all your folders and make a judgement myself. I know some folders are okay buuuuut the vacation photos 2008 is one I'd remove since it's not work related and I'm sure you have a better chance to see what you need and not.""

$client is silent for a short while ""thank you."" *hangs up.


I close the ticket and go about my day now we have a ticket grading system 1-10 on satisfaction rate from clients with the ability to comment.

I get a notification of him putting one 10/10 comment ""He helped me get alot of old family pictures I had forgotten about back.""

Feels good to be an ass at times.

TL;DR?  Moved a clients profile to a file server and saved photos of a vacation by misstake.",1115,0,1
I'd rather sleep under my car and face the bears.,"Sometimes, against our better judgement, we accept money from a customer and quickly regret it. Part of having a successful business is knowing when to say no, but sometimes we fail at that.

Things went well with the initial install and training, at least it seemed that way. The trainer said the owner was a little odd and that the general manager quit 2 days into the training, though she didn't know why. But overall she said the owner and other employees seemed to do well in training and things were running smoothly considering they had to find a new GM and several of the employees were also hired that week and not only had to learn new software, they had to learn everything else needed to operate a hotel. Things only got worse.

Within about a month all of the employees that had been trained had quit and the owner requested another few days of on site training with his new employees and the new General Manager he'd hired. During a night time training session they hear a ruckus down a hall and hear a woman yelling for someone to leave them alone. They see the owner, drunk, stumbling down the hall into the lobby and he leaves. An employee tells our trainer that the owner sometimes hits on women in the bar and gets turned down a lot.

A couple months go by nearly every week the owner calls with some sort of crisis that only the software can solve for him. We learn that everyone who had been trained, including the new GM, has quit, so the owner is on his own again and he is crumbling under the pressure. His calls to us get more and more angry to the point that a couple times we have to tell him to take a couple hours to calm down before calling again. We'll let a customer vent but we don't let them personally insult our staff.

We don't hear from him for a couple weeks and then we get a certified letter in the mail from his lawyer. This letter outlines all the ways our software has harmed his business, run off his customers, and cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue. Before he takes this to court he wants to give us the chance to refund the money he's paid us and reimburse him for lost revenue. One of the admin staff hears it being discussed and asks who the customer is. She Google's them and this is where the fun begins.

The hotel has a website but the images are from the 1980's and look like they were scanned from old magazine ads. We're talking station wagons with wood trim, wood paneling in the rooms, etc. The trainer that had gone out there twice said that the hotel looks nothing like that now. Another thing that turned up in Google was reviews. 

Oh, those reviews . . . We read page after page of reviews from 2 major sites and they were a comedy of failure. The one that sticks out the most, and is still a running joke in the office several years later, went something like this, ""I'd rather sleep under my car and face the bears than sleep one more night in this place."" There were a couple themes to these reviews. The first is that the hotel was filthy and never seemed to get cleaned. I'm not sure how many rooms had wet smelly carpet stains but there were at least 10 reviews complaining about it. Of course there were complaints that the hotel pictured on the website, while clean, didn't resemble the current state of the hotel. And finally, the other common theme, the aggressive drunk man that always seemed to be at the front desk or the bar. There were many complaints about him making unwanted advances, following women to their rooms, getting in to loud arguments with people, etc. 

We didn't even bother to consult with our lawyers. We printed out about 25 pages of reviews, in color, and carefully highlighted the fun bits. We sent a copy of the letter they sent us, along with these reviews, by the fastest delivery service available and never heard back from the lawyer or the customer.",1758,0,1

DO: ""So ITP, what happened?""

ITP:  ""Well, I'm showing the class how all of these sensors work with home automation and how to harvest and use the data stream.  I had everything setup and ready to run the first test on the temperature sensor.  I plugged in my hair dryer and turned it on to heat up the sensor and that is when it all shutoff.""

It was DNS!,"I literally just had this one happen. Never thought I'd actually see it, but here we are.

A customer came in complaining he couldn't connect to the corporate VPN at home. Typically when initiating the connection from the software, the user gets prompted for the credentials. This individual was not getting that prompt.

I take a look and first notice the laptop is not connected to any internet connection. I get it connected to the corporate wifi, attempt the VPN connection, and get the prompt. But something tells me to try another way...make sure. So I then connect the laptop to one of our hotspots that we use to test connectivity to the outside world only. Once that's connected, then I try to connect to the VPN. This time I do not receive the prompt for credentials.

I look at the VPN connection details while it's attempting and it just says ""Host Not Found."" I open up a web browser and try hitting the URL that we can use for the VPN. The page times out. I try hitting that URL from my phone while it's on mobile data and it gets there.

Back on the laptop, I go check the IP configuration. And there it is...he's got the addresses of the company's DNS servers hard-coded in there. I set the option back to ""Automatically Obtain"" for DNS and voila, he now gets prompted for the VPN credentials when trying to connect.

TL;DR - It was DNS.

UPDATE: The guy came back in today with the exact same problem. I checked the DNS settings and lo and behold, the DNS server addresses were populated again. This was a true WTF moment. I did  a little more troubleshooting and did a few reboots to try to replicate the behavior and determine how the addresses were getting set in the configuration.

I noticed he had the Cisco software installed for his IP phone that his group uses. I know this to be a problem for other things that are unrelated to the DNS issue. Things like when disconnecting from the VPN, it won't reconnect without rebooting the PC. But this software also doesn't allow for the reboot or shutdown...Windows will just go to the ""Restarting"" or ""Shutting Down"" screen and sit there indefinitely until a hard shutdown is enforced. I uninstalled the driver associated with the Cisco software that causes that behavior, rebooted, and tried again. On this and subsequent attempts, the DNS servers were no longer getting populated. That setting was staying set to ""Automatically obtain"" and was then allowing the VPN prompt to appear.",1270,0,1
The tale of Norman,"Norman. My sweet sweet Norman. I work at a small IT company focussing mainly on small business and home users. Generally speaking, most of my clients are competent enough to help me figure out their issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's Norman. Norman is a man in his 70's, a retired University professor who I'm sure was a brilliant man in his day. Though these days...not so much.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago Norman calls me up with a few small computer issues. His typical issue is struggling to get into his email, or needing help reseting passwords. I've installed a permanent remote support software on his computer so I'm readily accessible when he inevitably calls. He tells me he's having trouble logging into his email, so I remote in with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, being a retired professor, he still has access to his University email. This university in particular uses Duo two factor authentication for login. So anytime he logs into his email, his cell phone gets a push notification which he has to allow the login. The last piece of info that's relevant is that Norm has an iPhone 7 Plus.

&amp;#x200B;

Norm and I are on his computer, and get to the point where a push notification is sent. The following conversation ensues.

Norm: How am I going to be able to do this now, while we are on the phone?

Me: It's pretty simple. First thing, just put me on speakerphone. Am I on speaker?

Norm: Yes, I've got you on speaker

Me: Alright, go ahead and hit your home button for me then.

Norm:....Could you remind me which one is the home button?

Me: Sure, the button all the way at the bottom center of your phone.

Norm: Oh, you mean the big red button with a phone on it!

Me: No no Norm! That one will hang up. The home button is right below that.

Norm: There are no buttons below the red button

Me: Did you get a new phone?

Norm: No

Me: Then there is a physical button at the bottom of the phone, not on the screen. Push that.

Norm: Oh you must mean this red button with the phone symbol on it.

Me:...Nope not that one. I tell you what, why don't you call me from your home phone to make this easier

Norm: That sounds great I'll call right back from my home phone.

At this point, I'm a bit frustrated because this is taking a much longer time that it should, though I'm a patient guy especially with a guy like Norm. In a few minutes, Norm calls back from the same phone number. It goes as follows.

Me: Hey Norm did you call me from your house phone?

Norm: Yeah I called you from my house phone.

Me: Alright, I was just confused because it came up as the same number as your cell phone

Norm: Thats because I'm on my cell phone

Me:...

Norm: Did I do something wrong?

Me: No, not something wrong. But why don't you go grab your house phone now and give me a call. 

Norm: Okay Ill go grab it!

Norm goes to get his home  and returns. 

Norm: Alright I'll call you now.

He dials a number, and his OWN phone starts ringing. He tries to pick up, but as he just called himself, no one is there and he's not sure what happened.

Me:..............Norm how about I just come see you in person?",541,0,1
You don't know your passwords and you don't know how to look for a notification on your phone. I can't help you.,"I had a call once from a client with login issues. User was trying to reset their password and a quirk of our login system is that it doesn't work reliably on mobile web browsers and our app doesn't have the ability to change passwords.  And the official policy is we don't support mobile browsers.  It's stupid and I hate it, but that's the way it is. Anyway, the user needs to open the email link on a desktop browser to reset their password. But the user only has email on their phone, not their computer. So we go to login to Gmail on the computer. Surprise, the user doesn't know their password. So, even though it's outside of my scope of support, I try to help and guide them through the reset password options on Google. The only reset option the user has set up is a phone notification. Google says they sent it to the phone, but user swears up and down they don't see anything. Well that's the end of what I'm physically able to do. I'm polite over the phone, but in my head I am screaming.  I will never understand how people still cannot get their act together when it comes to passwords.  It's been a fairly common thing for over 20 years now",495,0,1
Server! Application! Network! Server! App! Network!,"This is a story about an issue two months in troubleshooting, but longer in making.

Some quick background - I work as a Network Engineer for a company that manufactures and sells audio/visual equipment.  We have multiple offices around the world, but this story involves only two - our Corporate Headquarters (HQ) and our primary manufacturing plant (MP), which are roughly two miles apart from each other.  

At the MP our line workers use handheld scanning PDAs to update and track inventory from a server located at HQ.  These PDAs use a specialized wireless network with strict policy to allow them to communicate to only this inventory server.  Originally there was a dedicated fiber link between HQ and MP, but at the beginning of this year we switched all our offices to a SD-WAN solution and the fiber link was taken down.  This setup has worked great for about six months, and another 10 years prior on the dedicated fiber path.

In the third week of August the line workers started complaining about 'lag' on a subset of the PDAs.  They complained that it would take roughly 30 seconds for a scan to pull the information from the server, when previously is was near instantaneous.  After some digging, we found that so long as the PDA kept being used then scans would be perfect, but after sitting idle for a few minutes the lag would reintroduce for the next scan.  

Even more frustrating was that only some of the PDAs were impacted.  We use two kinds - Zebra and Android.  The Android PDAs worked flawlessly, and the lag was only noticed on the Zebra scanners.

We opened a case with the vendor of the server, thus starting the blame game.

The server team blamed the network.  

The network team blamed the application.

The application team blamed the server.

And round and round we went for two months.

At multiple points during the troubleshooting we ran packet captures to watch the traffic.  I found that the traffic from the Zebra PDAs were traversing the network and talking to the server on port 7654.  The server responds normally.  After two minutes of inactivity, the server sends a ""Session close"" request to the PDA, which is never receives acknowledgment of.  If a user tries another scan after that time, the PDA reuses the same source port but the server neglects to respond, as it has already shut that connection down.  After 30 seconds the PDA gives up and retries from a new source port, which then works.  We also found that the Android PDAs exhibited the same traffic behaviour, but on port 80 and with no lack of response to the session close request.

So now that we knew the source of the lag, but not its cause, we had sufficient ammunition to take to the application administrators and ask what they changed to break only the Zebra PDAs.

Application team said 'nothing' and blamed the server team.

Server team said ""Yes, we patched the server a few days prior to the first report, but it's not that and must be the network.""

Network team said ""If it was the network then other applications would be impacted, not just this one type of scanner, so must be the application.""

And again we start the blame game for another month.

Eventually, in mid October, my boss is upset and frustrated.  ""I don't care what the cause is, I just want it fixed!  We've lost 190 man hours to this issue already!""

We schedule a call between all three teams with executives present in an effort to finalize a plan to fix the problem.  During this call it is decided that we will clone the server with the previous updates prior to the issue.  We will watch all traffic again and see if the issue repeats.  If it does, then we definitively know it's not the server, and in that case we will take the \~$5K hit to migrate the server to MP.

We clone the VM, run the tests.  Lag is still present.

My boss is upset, since this amounts to a huge financial hit during a time when we are trying to save money.

I decide to pore through the packet captures taken.  I quickly stumble over something that all of the previous packet captures did not have:

\-----

14	210.692358	{SERVER}  {ZEBRA PDA}	TCP	54	\[TCP ACKed unseen segment\] \[TCP Previous segment not captured\] 7654 → 1150 \[FIN, ACK\] Seq=18815 Ack=16384 Win=64314 Len=0

15	210.770979	{RANDOM L3 SWITCH}   {SERVER}	ICMP	82	Time-to-live exceeded (Time to live exceeded in transit)

\-----

Wait - Why is a random Layer 3 switch in our old core telling the server that traffic it sent timed out?  Traffic should not be going in that direction, not since we took down that fiber link...

The thing is, that fiber link is still technically in place, just in a disabled state and it lives in the old core.  We merely disabled the ports and the routes in case we needed to quickly roll back to it.  We never had to roll back though, and with COVID pandemic we sort of forgot to clean it all up.

In the second week of August I did a major firmware update of our HQ firewall.  This firmware update re-enabled a single specific route that was in place for the dedicated wireless network of the PDA scanners, designed to route that traffic not through our SD-WAN but through the fiber link in our old core.  

So I delete the route and magically the lag goes away.  The Zebra PDAs now actually see and respond to the session close requests like they should.

What is baffling to me, and why I think this makes a good story, is how a static route for a /24 network will break ONLY a specific subset of devices in that network, and ONLY a specific type of traffic for those devices.

Meanwhile, the server team still won't shut up about how they were right.  First time for everything I suppose.",208,0,1
To the remedial class!,"I had to visit the accountants office today.

Remember when Homer Simpson went to work for Hank Scorpio? Remember the remedial class Bart was put in to? It's like going in there.

I name them Tina and Ralph, Tina Belcher from Bob's burgers becasue whenever you ask her anything over the phone you get 20 seconds of ""errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"". ""can you click on start"" ""errrrrrrrrrrrrr"", ""is the monitor on?"" ""errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"", ""are the lights on in your office?"" ""errrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"", and Ralph for Ralph Wiggum.

The switch had been looped and dropped them off from the rest of the network. I theorise it's another attack of Consuela the OCD cleaner plugging lose network cables into sockets, I fix that. internet connectivity returns, IP phones spring back to life, network volumes reappear.

Ralph needs to test sage as that wasn't working.

Sage is Ralph's acid test for everything, internet can't be down because sage works, building can't be on fire becasue sage works. The internet must be broken because sage doesn't work.

Today everything must be broken becasue sage wouldn't open. Despite being told that the issue causing sage not to work was clear  and the sage network volume was now connected Ralph needed to see with own little pudgy eyes. The fact that it opened where previously there was an error was not enough, no he needs to go in and start processing a load of accounts data. 15 minutes in after doing this weeks expenses he declares everything fine.

But wait, i know a common issue in here, the network printer, ""can we test printing"" i say.  The gods know the game they are playing with me, it's not about the result, it never was, it's about the dance.. it's schroedingers printer. If it test it will work. If i leave without testing the printing it will fail, and i will have to suffer a call from one of these two, and you all know the type of call, the one where the caller wants to spend more time talking about the fact there is a problem than actually doing anything resembling working towards fixing the problem. Oh how i dream about interrupting people and saying ""You have spent 10 minutes talking about something that takes 10 seconds to fix, your have two ears and one mouth, how about using them in that ratio and you let me actually do my job?"" but i've been in this game too long to make that mistake, that's just a flaming ball of HR funtime waiting to happen, instead you suck it up and let them prattle on while being polite.

Tina errrrrrrrrs at me. For me a test print is open up notepad, type hi, click print, 10 seconds on a slow day. But Tina is doing it. ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. click on start, now which program, word or excel, she hovers the mouse between the two icons for 30 damn seconds. My Inner mononlogue is screaming ""Just F\*cking click one"", She opens word, but no, rather than just type test and hit print, she now has to choose a previous document, she sits there, motionless, for 30 seconds out of the minute of deciding i am unable to see her as like Drax the destroyer, she too has mastered the ability to be so incredibly still that she became invisible to the eye. Finally she opens the file, my heart drops, its 12 pages, she's going to read them all isnt she? Of course she is.

The printer whirrs into life. i've been here for an hour, this would have been a five minute job with anyone else in the company even Technical Dave - the man who wants to discuss his home networking projects with me at any opportunity and tries to use us as his personal network support.

I checked the next floor, Consuela had attacked there too, i removed the loop, cursed the budget commitee for not buying decent switches for every floor and told the three people on site that everything was restored. Total time spent on third floor finding the looped cable and fixing the issue - 2 minutes",429,0,1
When two old folks come into a wireless retail store...,"You already know its gonna be hell. 

I work at a wireless retail store. 

Yesterday I had this woman in her 60's come in, with her husband who had lost his phone. They didn't want to do an insurance claim and just wanted to upgrade. I told them even if they'd got a new phone, there was no way for us to transfer the data from the old phone to the new phone since they didn't have the old one on them. Immediately they started throwing questiins at me, specifically if I was ""in training."" 

I have only been there four months, and don't have tons of experience, so I am still getting used to the sales part, but I know how to do the job and understand the basics of our systems. I responded and told her no. 

From start to finish she questioned everything I did and said, bothering my coworker every few minutes even though he was clearly busy helping some other customers because ""he knew how to do it."" At the beginning, she told me she didn't know much about phones. And then as we went on, she started telling me I didn't know what I was doing, that I had to do such and such first, and made negative comments about literally everything. 

She made it clear she was worried about her husband not being able to keep his number. I told her not to worry, and that it wouldn't be a problem. I went and got out the new sim card, and began to update it but our system was moving slow, it was just taking forever to load. 

While waiting for it to kick up, her husband asked me what he would need to do in order to make his old device inaccessible incase it was stolen. I explained he'd have to call customer care, explain it to them, and request they block the IMEI. Device blocking isn't something we can do on our end, per company policy. Immediately his wife chimed in, ""Yes you can! They did it for us last time!"", she turned to my coworker, and immediately lost her shit, ""Sir! Sir! Can you come over here and help her since you know what you're doing? Last time we were able to transfer the number and didn't have to call any numbers!"" 

Like, we weren't even talking about that? He explained exactly what I said to her, and she continued to pester him. 

The rest of the process went rather smoothly, but i could hear them complaining under their breath about everything. When they came in, they specifically asked for the IPhone 11. They kept making comments about how ""small"" the phone was, and how it always took 2 hours when they came to a store. I mean, Idk, don't come in then? Maybe buy a more expensive, and bigger phone next time? 

Its always a pain in the ass working with older people like this. Especially when they're never satisfied with anything.",1363,0,1
We're getting a message saying we're out of licenses.,"We had a customer once, actually we still have them, that tried to be sneaky and steal our software. The owner of the restaurant had, unbeknownst to us, 2 other restaurants in the same town. A couple years prior to this we got a call that their server crashed and they needed to reinstall the software and activate the license. This happens all the time so we think nothing of it. The next week we get another call saying the new server was having problems and they needed to reinstall again and needed another license activation. It happens sometimes and we have no reason to question them.

That's until a couple years later when we get a call from a new restaurant manager needing some help adding items to the menu. We don't recognize the restaurant name so we ask him for the license number so we can get a support ticket started. It comes up as another restaurant and when we ask the manager to clarify he tells us that's another one of their locations. The manager gets the help he needs but one of our sales managers contacts the owner about this and the owner blows it off and says the manager was confused and gave us the wrong name. We're getting suspicious and make a note in their account.

A few months go by and we get a call from a local IT professional who's installing some new workstations. When he tries to launch the app he's informed that the maximum number of licenses is already in use. We tell him we'll contact the owner to get some more licenses purchased and just have log off a couple other workstations to test. This is when someone finally, however unknowingly, spills the beans. He tells us that since they have a corporate license, can't he just reduce the licenses at another one of the restaurants that don't need them.

Hmm . . . Please tell us more. This IT guy tells us how they're running our software at 3 restaurants and that the owner tells him they have a corporate license and can install it as many times as they want. We don't have anything called a corporate license and we explain this to the IT guy who is sort of shocked by this and a little offended that the owner would have him help in stealing software. He then tells us that he helped with the 2 other installs and though it was odd that they didn't want him to call to activate the licenses. It looks like the owner was trying to fool him too. At the end of the call the IT guy gives us the names and addresses of the other restaurants as well as the number of users he thinks they have at each location.

We have a sales manager that lives for situations like this and he makes the call. The owner doesn't deny anything, though. The sales manager feels deflated because he was hoping for an epic argument, but he make a decent sale and add 2 more restaurants to their support contract, so that makes him feel better. It's like a spouse that cheats but comes clean when you confront them. They promise never to do it again, and they don't, but you still keep an eye out for anything suspicious.",2135,0,1
"Rude client with no SLA wants me to drop everything for them, calls me 'Rude' when he realizes that I follow my companies procedures.","Also on r/AITA

The company I work for specialises in installing and maintenance of Bio-metric and physical access (fingerprint readers, doors, etc) for all types of companies but we are mainly focused on Data Centres &lt;DC's &gt;(essentially big places that other companies rent space to host their servers), and a technician from a branch of a DC company emailed me on Tuesday afternoon saying that their 'visitor enrollment' system is down.

So I replied asking for Teamviewer details, passwords, etc, cc'ing our accounts people top prepare the quote. That was at 1pm. I left my office at 5PM with no response. At 6, the tech who logged the initial call called our emergency support number that is given to clients who have a SLA with us, conversation is as follows:

Me- Good evening this is me how can I help you?

P1- Why haven't you connected yet?

Me- I'm sorry who is speaking here?

P1- This is 'P1' from 'branch'.

Me- Okay I remember. I haven't connected because you haven't sent me any details.

P1- I haven't sent them because I thought you would have them.

Me- Well I don't have them (and never have stored them) as your company does not have a SLA (service level agreement) with us at all.

P1- I want it fixed NOW!

Me- We can only help you as soon as a 'slot' opens up.

P1- I'll pay once I get the invoice! When are you connecting and when will I get the invoice?

Me- 10AM tmw as I have meetings at SLA clients. Normally I'm done with them by 10AM and you will get the invoice at the same time as we send the Job card.

P1- Not good enough. I want immediate support.

Me- Well if I'm finished before 10, then I'll connect then, if I have the details.

P1- You'll get them.

Wednesday comes. No email from the client until 11AM where it includes all the details which took 2 hours to finish. Then I send the job card + invoice to P1 + P1 boss. I received the signed job card as I got into the office yesterday.

Today I get a phone call from 'P1' asking me why I sent him invoices when he wanted 'quotes'. I told him that ""this was a P1 support call + he also requested it when I send the job cards, + I have voice recordings backing me up on that.

P1- You're so rude!

Me- You're calling me rude, when you don't respond to my emails with the requested info to sort out your issue, use the emergency support number after hours demanding immediate service when you don't have a SLA with us and expect us to serve you at your convenience without paying us for that privilege, you call me rude. Luckily we record all of our conversations. I'll be sending your boss a email. We'll see who is rude.

I relayed everything to my boss who without a moment's hesitation said 'From now on no support to that company until the invoice is paid. They can go to (cheap competitor) for all we care. Email the complaint &lt;P1 boss&gt;, &lt;P1 CEO&gt; and cc myself. Include everything in it.'

Why did you sell us these flimsy touch screen monitors? Send us replacements.,"In the early days of online sales mostly dialup at this point, my company partnered with a distributor and we quickly became one of the largest online drop shipping companies of P.O.S. hardware in the US. This was short lived because our success was quickly noticed by other companies as well as the distributor and the business model was repeated so often that within a couple years it became difficult to make a profit that was worth the headache. I have lots of stories from this time and here's one.

An off the strip Vegas casino had ordered maybe 20 touch screen monitors from us. These were the Elo CRT monitors, not the now common LCD monitors we have today. After a few weeks we get a call that they want to return some of them because they're defective and their fingers have punched holes in them. They say the monitors are so cheap that their fingers just punch into the screen with normal use. Say what?

We contact the distributor to figure out what to do and the distributor is just as confused as we are. They provide the customer with return shipping labels and maybe a week later the distributor calls us. They say that it looks like the monitors have had things thrown at them or hit with hammers and that they won't be covering the replacements under warranty. We call the customer and explain what the distributor told us and they act like it's no big deal and order replacements. We still don't know what happened to them but maybe it was a bar fight or a disgruntled employee smashing things. I'm never shocked when a customer tries to get free stuff with lies but this was really bold.",995,0,1
Told a Coworker to fix something for herself and got witness to cabel-genozide,"Longtime lurker, first-time Poster

TLDR at the end

Obligatory „not a techsupport“, because i do not work in the IT-Department of my company.  
The reason I still will write this, is because I am something of an unofficial techsupport in my own department. I got this tasks because first I am a gamer and techsavy enough to do it and second because if you want some simple things done by our IT-Department it will take months. til they help you.

So yeah, I am responsible for things like assembling workstations for new workers or first level support when a program does not want to flow someone demands. Additionally I am tasked with the administration of our process management tool (which guarantees enough stories to post here).

Upfront my first language is not English so if my grammar is not correct or your find some mistake then, dear redditors, take them,print them and put them in a nice frame and on your walls.

Now to the story:  
Last year we moved from an old officebuilding to a new one. This meant that I was tasked with getting all workstations into boxes and then running again at our new office. I did not have the resources and also not the material to get all cables nice and tidy (we only had few cable ties and I had to work with duct tape) but I got the into one of those cable ducts that are mounted to the working table. 

This was ok until these events went down two weeks ago:

You see this construction of mine was okish but not very stable. This meant if someone tinker with this, there was a good chance that it will fall down and make a huge mess of the cables in it.

Enter Coworker (CW1) number one. I do not know how this went down but somehow she knocked everything down. She told me that this happened and asked me if I could fix it fast. Now the problem was I had no free timeslots and I was not motivated to spend some overtime to reassemble my construction on this day.

Therefore, I told her that I will look for an opportunity to fix it as soon as possible but it can take a week or so. The problem was that my construction included the cables of 2 workstation so there was also a second Coworker I will from now on call Sarah.  
 Sarah was and still is a typical entitled person that has no idea how to fix things, especially when it comes to IT, but gets salty when you do not make her problem your number one priority.

The following conversation ensued:

Sarah: These cables look horrible and they are in my way (Note: No they were not. She could only reach them if she really tried). Fix them fast

Me: I do not have time for this right now. I told CW1 that I will fix it as soon as possible, maybe ‘til next week

Sarah: No this is unacceptable. Fix it right now or I will not be able to work

Me (a bit annoyed): You are able to work! This will not stop you from working. You can hardly touch them

Sarah: You have no idea how hard it is to work with this at my feet. Now just do it!

Me (not in a mood for a long argument): Look if you want it fixed now please just do it yourself. If have some material right here \[points at my personal material box\].

I have to say this was the sentence I would regret afterwards. But for the time being, there was no more discussion about fixing it.  
When I got to work the next day, everything seemed normal. This was until Sarah come to work and bolted right to our Head of Department (let’s call him Steve).  
 She came out with him and the screaming started:

Sarah: Why the hell did you say to me I should fix it. Now my computer does not work anymore

Me: Wha … What did I do? (I had no idea what she is talking about)

Sarah: You destroyed my computer you damn Idiot 

Me: What … I did not … I did not even touch your PC

Sarah: Yeah you did. You told me to fix it and I fixed it

Steve: Can you please fix her PC so it will work again?

Not knowing what she did I went to her Workstation to look what she did.  
 Then I saw the horror of everyone who likes to work on PCs. You see next to my material is a little tool box with some standard tool (Pliers, screwdrivers etc.)

What she did was she took the pliers that have that thing you can cut cables with (don’t know how this is called). And she cut every cable that were “in her way), so frankly all of them.

Me: What. the. Hell. Did. You. Do?

Sarah: I did what you told me and I fixed it. Just the way you said me?

Steve: Fix her PC so that it is running again

Me: How should i? Why did you do that?

Sarah: This solved the problem … now I will not be held back by the cables

Steve comes over and looks at the crime scene

Steve: What the f-? Did you tell her to do this?

Me: Hell no. I did not tell her to go full-rambo on these cables.

Sarah: It is solved now, just fix the computer you lazy idiot. I need to work

Me: How should I do that? You just massacred 8 Cables that your PCS need to run.

Sarah: \[Confused look\]

Me: Don’t tell me you did not know that you need the cables to.

Sarah: \[turning away and getting fire-red\]

Me: F- me sideways \[sigh\] … ok Steve I need you to order some cables so I can fix this.   
Until then I will go to IT and ask for a spare Laptops or something.

Sarah: You told me to fix it… now it is destoyed. You are incompetent and lazy

Steve: Sarah shut it! We will talk about this later! Now let him get you something so you can work.

Two days later I got everything fixed and running smooth again.  
Sarah got a stern talking from Steve and our Head of IT about not to brutalize infrastructure and had to work on one of our shitty laptops for 2 days.  
I just felt sorry for CW1 because she also had to work on a shitty laptop for 2 weeks. 

And at the end I got to tell you this tale of the cable murderer in my office.

TL:DR: Told an impatient entitled Coworker to fix her own workstation because I had no time for it. She proceeded by taking my pliers and murdering every cable she could find",1293,0,1
Open circuit? This little thing opens it.,"This is barely tech support, but I'll let you judge if it's close enough. Couple years ago, a friend of mine opened up a bar. Worked like hell, scrounged around for the necessary equipment / furniture/ etc., made rather a nice place.

About a month in, he gave me a call. ""Hey, do you have a multimeter? My dishwasher has a broken wire somewhere and the tech can't find it."" So, I head over, this commercial dishwasher is stripped of all its covers, the control board is hanging from its harness,  showing all the signs of a frustrated repairman.

The thing just won't start a cycle. He's explaining that the tech couldn't find anything wrong, changed the board, didn't help, as he clears a space for me to work. Must, therefore, be a broken wire somewhere, they conclude.

I reached out and pushed as I told him, ""try it now."" Surprise, there it goes! Running perfectly! Just half an hour of reassembly to do.

The problem? The door switch was bent slightly out of place. That little switch means I still can't spend any money when I go to that bar!

Son of backup adventures,"As a follow-up to my [previous tale of woe](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/jag7cf/nobody_cares_if_the_backups_work_only_if_the/), I have discovered another . . . quirk in the tape backup system.

The new server arrived with six tapes. We've only ever had four before, but OK, they're not that cheap, so great. They get labeled with a letter, A through F.

As noted before, the backup software won't overwrite (what it thinks is) the latest tape, so it keeps track.

The problem is, it's only aware of tapes A through D, because we've never had an E or F before.

Does it throw an error of some kind when confronted with this mysterious tape? No, of course not. Does it even respond *consistently*? You're an optimist if you expect that.

What it does is take tape E or F and assume it's tape A. It doesn't relabel it - if I read the tape label, it says E or F as expected. And it doesn't cause the backup to fail, it just logs it as being successful on tape A.

Unless, of course, the most recent successful backup was on the actual tape A, or E or F (recorded as A), in which case it just quietly ignores the whole confusing situation and pretends it wasn't supposed to do a backup at all, just like it would if we forgot to change the tape.

And don't get me started on switching from alphanumeric store numbers to numeric store numbers, only not really because the store field in the database is only one character long. That's a tale for another day.",154,0,1
"Your software isn't working with our new cash drawers, help. Now with 100% more electrical shock!","Our software activates cash drawers by sending a message to a printer with a cash drawer plug in it. This is either a drawer 1 or drawer 2 message and you have to make sure your cash drawer is compatible with this method of activation when you buy one. Most are, though so it's rare that a customer comes across one that won't work.

I'm working with a bar manager who ordered these cash drawers and he's pretty eager to get them working since he's the one who ordered them - without verifying that they were compatible. We go through all the troubleshooting steps, we verify that the old drawer solenoid activates (it was too weak to unlock the drawer but you could hear it click), make sure the cables aren't broken or cut, etc. At this point I'm suspecting that the wiring is wrong for his Epson printers and suggest he find an old phone cable and try splicing wires together until he finds the right combination. These cash drawers used a standard 4 wire phone cable and this was in the days of dial up modems and businesses usually had a few of these spare cables around. 

He finds a cable and then we discuss how to determine which pair of wires the signal is coming from. I tell him I'll look up some schematics but jokingly say you can always put the wires to your tongue while hitting the ""Open Drawer"" button, similar to when you test a 9 volt battery with your tongue. A few seconds later I hear a scream and then some very vulgar language. This guy actually put the wires to his tongue. This is 12 volts with a respectable amperage. He told me what he did and I laughed and told him I was joking. He just responded with a sort of embarrassed, ""Oh . . ."" But you know what? He found the hot pair of wires and with that he was able to figure out the right wires to splice to activate the drawers. Dude seriously earned his paycheck that day.",1646,0,1
"The kitchen is on fire, can you login and fix that?","Second post (mobile)

Background: from the US. Been doing help desk support for ~6yrs. I worked as in-house IT for ~2.5yrs, and MSP help desk for ~3.5yrs. Certified engineer for a VoIP phone system. Most of my training was self taught [trial and error, YouTube, etc], and the rest was learned on the job.

Story time:

My first IT job was in-house IT for an entertainment facility (or rather a chain of facilities). I had worked in the facility for quite some time prior to being “promoted” to IT... started as cashier and worked my way to shift manager. Huge step up, I know [sarcasm]. I had experience with how the systems worked and how to interact with customers. The facility had a bar and small restaurant, and we often hosted large events from birthdays to corporate gatherings. There were arcade games and bowling, music and laser lights, the whole nine yards. I had become very familiar with various issues that occurred throughout the facility, and being a manager, I had to make sure things ran smoothly for the guests. An issue would arise and the cliché “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” became old. After an altercation with a sh*t faced drunken Karen (involving pitchers of beer being hurled at my head and a call to law enforcement at 3am), I had enough and was ready for a career change. The head of IT caught wind of this, and hired me on the spot (IT would only hire internal employees to save time with training and familiarizing with the facilities).

As mentioned in my last post, we had an on-call rotation. 

During my first week of “IT training” (more like Pavlov’s conditioning), I was asked to shadow my coworker and assist where I can. One night (maybe my third or fourth IT shift) we received a tech call around midnight. Our office was open 9-5, and afterhours calls went to voicemail. We’d get an email with a transcription of the message. The message read “Hi IT guys, the kitchen is on fire. What do I do? Can you just like login and fix that?”

It took a few moments for my brain to process whether this was a joke or a serious issue. Being inexperienced, I messaged my coworker and waited for his response. While waiting, I went ahead and called the client. Got voicemail, and heard nothing from my coworker. Fantastic [sarcasm]. We had remote access to the security system at the client location so I taught myself how to use our software and take a look. Again, this was my first week on the job so I didn’t know much about our software yet. Literally one second after I logged in, the client called me back.

EU: “Ya IT guy, the grill in the kitchen is on fire. Can you like just turn on the sprinklers or something?”

Me: “What?! No, I’m afraid I can’t. Did you turn off the gas to the grill?! Have you called 911?!”

EU: “Umm... no...”

Me: “Turn off the gas!! Grab the fire extinguisher and put out the fire!!”

There was a pause. I watched the security camera in the kitchen and saw flames shooting out like dragon’s fire from the grill as the client stood dumbfounded.

EU: “We don’t have a fire extinguisher...”

Me: *forehead meets desk* “I am looking at the security camera. On the wall behind you is a fire extinguisher. Next to that is the red emergency cutoff lever for the gas. Turn off the gas, and extinguish the fire!”

EU: “...how do I do that?”

One on-the-fly fire fighting lesson later and they managed to extinguish the fire. As the dust settled I asked:

Me: “So why did you call IT for a kitchen fire instead of calling 911?”

EU: “Well, I tried calling the shift manager but he didn’t answer. So I called the GM, but they didn’t answer... and I knew if I called IT you guys HAD to answer.”

Can’t really argue that logic...

Needless to say, I made sure the managers updated their kitchen safety procedures and trained their staff... and placed an order for some new ceiling tiles...",347,0,1
"""Why won't the screaming stop?!""","Another short tale from Point of Sale.

Back in the day one of my customers was the cafeteria at a local hospital. They had several cash registers that connected via a proprietary network to a back office PC where they could run reports and authorize transactions using the patients ID number.

At the end of every shift they would run reports on those long folio folded perforated ledger sheets with the green and white stripes. If you are over 50 you know exactly what I'm talking about.

These were continuous feed via a tractor mechanism to a dot matrix printer. The sheets were 8 1/2 x 14 legal size so the printer was huge.

&amp;#x200B;

One day we got a call. 

""The printer won't stop screaming when we print reports!""

Screaming?

Yes Screaming.

In a hospital.

It was disturbing patients apparently.

So I go out there, run a report and damned if the printer didn't start screaming like it was a peacock being murdered!

I do all my checks and am about ready to pull out my screwdrivers ( machines fear me when I get out the screwdrivers ) when I look down the paper feed path and see...

An Aspirin.

As the paper went through the tractor feed it dragged along the aspirin and vibrated it against the plastic feed guide at JUUUST the perfect frequency to sound exactly like a woman's scream.

I removed the aspirin and it was just as quiet as you remember dot matrix printers to be.

After explaining what had happened I offered the aspirin to the Office Manager. She declined.",2092,0,1
40 years of Google spying,"I work for an ISP that provides cable tv, internet, and phone service as well as email. We’ve recently changed the email client we use to host our email accounts. Today was the day it took place. Many calls came in today about customers not being able to login, missing emails in various folders, etc. One issue with the new client is that if a customer tries to access  the email account on a smart phone the customer has to use a mail client app(gmail, Apple mail, etc.) 

One particular customer called today and was upset about having to use a client app to get her emails and the conversation went something like this. 

CL = conspiracy lady Me= me. 

CL: So there is nothing that can be done if I want to get my emails on my phone? I have to use an app of some kind.

Me: Unfortunately with the new email client we’ve begun using you will not be able to access emails from the web browsers anymore on a smart phone, you will have to use a mail app client. 

CL: well I’m not happy about this. I don’t want to use any app to access my emails from my phone because I have to download it from the play store and I don’t want to do that because I have an Android. Do you know who makes android? Google. Do you know that google spies on everything we do? I’m not going to use Gmail to access my emails. 

Me: We do have a (company name) app that you can use to access the emails. You won’t have to use Gmail at all if you don’t want to. 

CL:  But I still have to download it from the GOOGLE play store, won’t I? 

Me: Yes you will have to download it from the google play store.

CL: Well I’m not going to do that. I don’t want google reading my emails, spying on everything I do. It’s my right as an American to hate google so that is what I’m going to do. I used to be able to push one button on my phone and get my emails and you’re telling me if I want to access my emails on my phone again I have to be spied on?

Me: Unfortunately with a smart phone you will have to download a mail app of some kind, with the email client we’ve moved to accessing emails from the web browser will no longer be possible. Again, you don’t have to use google’s Gmail app, you can use (company name) app, yahoo’s mail app, you just need a mail app that will need to be downloaded from the App Store. 

CL: OP I’ve been using computers for 40 years! Do you know that google has been spying on everything I do for those 40 years!? I’m tired of being spied on, I’m tired of their harassment, and I’m tired of them invading my privacy. It’s my right as an American to hate google and I’ve been fighting them for 40 years. I just want them to leave me alone. 

Me: You can still access your emails on computers through the web browser if you have a computer. I apologize for the inconvenience bu.....

CL: But with a smart phone I need an app. I get it. Well I’m not happy. I really don’t like this and I hope you put that in my file or records or whatever. You have a good rest of your day. (End of call)

So google which was started in 1998 has been spying on this lady since 1980? 🤔",338,0,1
All of the kitchen printers failed. Why did you sell us junk?,"We once had a local customer who was one of those types who blows up under stress. Nobody would deal with him so we decided to sell him hardware as well as software. Great food, great chef, terrible business sense. They're closed now.

We get a call on a Friday afternoon that all of their kitchen printers have failed. He's given basic troubleshooting steps over the phone and says that nothing is helping. They're all connected to workstations via LONG ASS parallel cables and all of this is secure and it's unlikely 4 cables would go bad at the same time. He tells us the lights are on and nothing seems wrong. The receipt and expediter printers are fine so the operating system and software aren't likely the problem.

They don't have a support contract with us but because the hardware is still under warranty we tell him we'll order some replacements. He's desperate and has a really busy weekend and offers free dinner and alcohol as well as agreeing to a 6 month support contract if we'll send someone out right away. Being the top guy has its advantages and I snap this amazing opportunity up.

I get there and the owner is about to have a mental breakdown. He rushes me to the kitchen and starts yelling at me to fix the junk printers we sold him (industry standard Epsons). I look at the printers and see that there are no lights.  I mention this to him and he tells me it's just one more problem he's been dealing with because several of his fancy blenders aren't working either and he won't be able to make sauces and such fast enough to keep up with demand. It take me about 15 seconds for the light in my tiny brain to come on and I ask if all of these things are on the same breaker. He stops to think for a few seconds and that frantic look on his face turns to calm and he walks to the breaker panel and flips the tripped breaker back on.

Everything is working now and he sort of apologized for being an ass. He obviously didn't check much and when he told us the lights were on, he probably didn't even look at the printers. I get it, he was stressed and about to pull his own hair out. Anyway, I sat down to an amazing meal with a grateful customer. I don't drink wine but he gave me a bottle to take to the office as well as a giant bottle of some delicious seasoned olive oil and several loaves of fresh baked bread.  I think I'm the only employee who had a good experience with this guy. His restaurant did really well until he couldn't find employees willing to deal with his breakdowns under stress.",2464,0,1
When computer repair gets dangerously close to terrorism,"This was the early 2000's, and I was working for a consulting firm that had a lot of contracts with local school systems.  I did everything from server setups and networking, to replacing the mouse balls the kids were constantly removing to play with.

I have a ticket that a classroom PC was not working on the 4th grade hall.  I wait outside the door until the teacher stops talking, then stick my head in and ask if I can fix the PC real quick.  It is on the other side of the room by the windows and out of the way, so I go over and quietly try to diagnose the problem.  I start running through the usual suspects and find the problem pretty quick.  The door off of a 3.5"" floppy has come off and jammed in the drive.  Back in the old days this was a fairly common issue, especially in computers that had a lot of traffic from different users all day.

The problem is that the kids would usually try to fix it themselves, and end up bending the door so that it was opened up even wider, which made it a pain to get out.  Luckily I had the perfect tool for this, a 5"" lockblade knife that would let you get up under the bent part, then slide back to hold the door closed while you fished the whole thing out.  Worked like a charm most of the time and was really quick.  You have probably already figured out the problem here, and I stress that I had *never* thought about this.  I didn't work in the school rooms much.  I was a server guy and my time was usually more useful somewhere else, so this was kind of a side-deal when they didn't have anything more important for me to do.  So I reach into my bag, pull out the knife, pop it open in one motion while heading for the floppy drive.

Behind me I hear an audible *gasp*.  I turn around and the whole room is staring at me.  It slowly dawns on me that I just pulled a pretty mean looking knife on 20ish 10-year-olds.  I apologized to the teacher and explained that this really was the best tool for fixing this particular problem, but that I probably should use the 2nd best tool from now on.  Lucky for me, this was a really rural school, so the teacher just laughed and let it go.  I didn't even get sent to principals office!  I can't help but think that with all the tension we seem to have these days, that a similar mistake might not get laughed off any more.",713,0,1
Excel expert required for map project,"I was job hunting. A local temp agency had this listed, so I applied. They called me that afternoon, and you could smell the desperation through the phone. Apparently I was the only Excel expert who had replied at all.

I interviewed the next day. Let the parade of facepalms begin!

The large company needed to update their emergency escape maps, so that in the event of a fire, employees and visitors would know where to run and where to gather. Doesn't sound much like an Excel job yet.

They had hand-drawn maps of some sites, architectural drawings from some sites, and pictures from a helicopter of one. And they had one electronic file! Some gifted employee had drawn a map in Paint, put it in an Excel file (for reasons never explained) and sent it in.

The project manager, a brilliant but non-technical guy, looked at all this and decided that Excel must be the tool to use. And they needed an expert, because, well, experts make them look better.

I have a policy to never visibly facepalm during a job interview. I followed my policy but the temptation was so strong.

I explained to him that Excel, while it was an awesome tool, was absolutely the wrong tool for the job. He was trying to drive nails with a CNC lathe. I recommended that he find somebody who was good with MS Visio. We shook hands and I left.

The temp agency called which I was driving home and asked me to spell 'Visio.' I did.

They called me back later that afternoon and asked if I knew how to use Visio? I do, it is really pretty simple. They told me that the boss had been impressed enough with my honestly suggesting he hire someone else that he wanted to hire me.

So I spent six months tracing Google Earth images of worksites and figuring out which escape routes fit our state's fairly vague rules for emergency escape maps. Easy work, nice people.  

The job could have been done in a fraction that time by a decent graphic designer, but they wanted me, I wanted the paycheck, and the work got done.",570,0,1
The only call that matters,"A few years ago I worked as tech-support for one of the largest tech companies in the world. I'd handled thousands of calls up to this specific one. Some are probably a great story of their own, but it doesn't matter. This is the only one worth telling. 

I actually really enjoyed that job. A lot of it probably was because I was rather good at it, not to sound full of myself, but it's rather important to the story. Most of the calls I received were not great technical mysteries you needed an engineering degree to figure out. They were about the people, and their lack of basic knowledge and understanding of the confusing technology, in their words. So I helped them. We reset passwords, restarted computers and plugged in chargers. All while keeping the conversation flowing and feeling natural, but always steering the conversation in the direction needed. It was smalltalk with a purpose, and I was great at it. I was always in control, except this one time. 

Not often but sometimes someone called in trying to get information that they had no right to. They were never successful. There are systems and procedures protecting against this, and they can't be argued with or broken. And I followed them to the letter. 

I received a call from a woman, which I early in the conversation believed were one of these calls. She asked me if I could help her get into her sons phone. My mind instantly went to that this kid had probably done something wrong, and the proof was on the phone, and I was suppose to help her get it. As it was not my job to judge bad parenting I asked her if she knew any of the passcodes he might have used. Since she probably wouldn't, my next step would stop her chances at getting access to what her son probably wouldn't want her to see. She of course replied she did not know, and that she did not want to completely lock the phone with entering the wrong code several times. This lead naturally into me explaining that to get access to the phone it needs to be restored and that this would also erase all the content. She quickly replied that she did not want to erase it, she wanted the photos on it. So my earlier suspicion was confirmed. 

I need to clarify that up to this point this have been a completely normal conversation, nothing unusual, other than the somewhat unusual request. With me wanting to end the conversation seeing we weren't getting anywhere, I told her the obvious solution she probably want to avoid. Just ask your son if he can unlock the phone for you. 

I have heard the expression that words can paint a picture, but I really hadn't understood the meaning up to this point. There was a moment of silence on the other end before she replied, I can't, he is dead. The way these words were said gripped me to my core. It was not the words themselves and it was not said while crying or with the intent to feel sorry for her. It was something bare and raw I had never experienced before. She showed me a piece of her soul in that moment, and my own welcomed hers and felt everything. For her something more precious than all else was just gone, and nothing could replace it, but she needed my help to treasure the memories. In this tiny moment I felt more connected to another human being than I ever have before. 

We both must have felt this moment and connection, because a moment later she told her story. It was as natural as talking to a good friend and in my heart I wanted to listen and just be there for her. Her son had been struggling for a while, and she had done all in her power to help him and make it better. Two days prior to her talking to me she had found her son in the woods behind their house. He had hanged himself from a tree. He was 15 years old. 

At this point my mind was not at work, following the rules and regulations. I was helping another human being, and I did everything I could possibly think of to help her get access to her sons photos. I probably would have been fired if my boss knew all the procedures I didn't follow that day, and I hadn't cared if I had. Unfortunately at the end I was not able to help her get access, the security at that point was just too well encrypted for my level of skill. Regardless she was very grateful for me trying to help in what way I could. 

I do not remember her name, but that does not matter. It didn't then, so why now. I think of her now and then and hope she has found some way to brighten the missing part she showed me.",278,0,1
Well that's what cell towers are for!,"This happened a few years ago, but I just passed a sign that made me think of it.

So I manage a help desk for a not for profit agency that has lots of different types of workers, including staff with doctorates (psychology mainly). We tend to bend over backwards for them because they are fairly expensive and to have a Dr sitting on their thumb because tech isn't working is a huge money loss for us. So when tickets come in for them I often handle it personally.

So enough background. I get a call from a doctor that he just has a terrible time doing telemedicine from his home. He works with clients all over and it's easier and cheaper for him to work from one spot, instead of traveling and charging mileage and since doctor, he gets to pick the spot.

Issue boils down to his internet at home can't support his telemedicine in a high quality, no buffering format when his wife is working from home and his kids are watching movies/playing playstation. Well duh, you don't have enough bandwidth even though you have the best the sole ISP in the area can offer (according to him) So I offer a solution. Verizon Mifi, connect to his laptop and boom, he's on his own connection and things should be fine. A dozen other doctors use it not a problem. I order it, he stops in, I connect it test it and send him away.

Week later he calls, it's still not good enough and he really hates it on the laptop he wants an ipad because ""I want what I want and I heard they are the best"". So I grab a spare one and he comes in, I connect his mifi and send him on his way.

Another week same thing. It's too slow too slow. He tells me he has 4 bars of service so that shouldn't be the issue, it must be because it's a seperate device and not like another doctors that has a built in wireless card.

So I buy a brand new ipad from Verizon, set it all up test it and it still works beautifully and get it to him.

Another week, same problem. So I tell him I'm  coming out to his house to see what's up because they work fine from his work office on the days he comes in . Maybe he just happens to be right next to the microwave at home, or in his own personal farady cage idunno but I need eyes on. See the problem in person.


So I head to his nice affluent neighborhood with giant houses and see all these signs ""say no to the tower!"" ""No ugly tower"" ""cell towers bring down home values!"" and it dawns on me. He doesn't have cell service.

I get to his house and it's 1, maybe 2 bars of service (you know, it's always 4 when you ask them over the phone ) . I test every corner of his house with my signal app and it's garbage signal. I talk to him about the yard signs and he openly admits that his whole neighborhood is blocking a cell tower from being built nearby because ""it's an eyesore"". I explain that's why he has bad service but it's still not good enough. ""Can't you just use the cloud!?""

I end up finding a partial work around though. I tell him when he's at home and trying to work to TURN OFF THE TV that they have in the living room that they loop a youtube video , in HD, of calming oceanscapes and mountainsides. Rich people ambience I guess.  I also get his wife to switch to the Mifi for her work and music streaming since it's not video related AND I found out that he wasnt even on the 100mbps internet plan from the ISP, just the 50mbps because he just never called to switch it when it rolled out (they automatically shifted everyone after about 6 more months because a competitor was starting fiber in the area and they wanted to keep all the rich ~~suckers~~ clients)

"Student impatiently shoved floppy in upside down, destroying the drive and took PC offline","This was way back when I was in college working in the school computer lab, like back in late 1980's (or was it early 90's?). PC only has 3.5 inch floppy drives. Students have to save homework on them. To check-in, they go to the counter. We have a board with a little ID pocket for each PC available. Student gives the attendant (me) his or her ID, I slide it to the appropriate station's slot. They go to the PC. Our PC's have NO storage and boots off the network ROM, if you remember that far back. 

it was project time, and the lab is full, every machine is occupied, even the older ones with only 5.25 floppies. I know which students needs which. I send the students who were only logging into the local Mini computer to the 5.25 stations, to save the 3.5 stations for the other students doing homework on floppies. 

I had an ES (entitled student) coming up to the counter, slightly surly attitude. I swear I only checked her in minutes before. 

Me=Me

ES=entitled student

Me: Can I help you?

ES: I can't get my floppy out of the computer. 

I looked at the counter. There were like 4 people lined up for stations, but none were available. And I was the only staff on duty (I was a student, the lab supervisor is out to lunch).  I got one of the regulars to watch the counter (they can't move IDs, but at least they can tell students to wait), then I went to check the station. 

Sure enough, the disk is jammed tight. The eject button won't bring it out. 

So I use the tip on a pen cap to prop the slot flap open and look inside. 

And I see a silver thing. 

If you remember what a 3.5 inch floppy look like, you can see where this is going. If not, please refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk#%E2%80%8B3_1%E2%81%842-inch_disk) and look at the picture, then read the caption. 

WTF... 

Me: What happened? 

ES: Well, I put the disk in. 

Me: And? 

ES: it won't read.  And I can't get it out. 

I already understood what happened. She had shoved the disk in upside down. 

But I can just hear you exclaim, ""but that's impossible! It won't go in upside down!"" 

And indeed that won't happen if you are a NORMAL user. But ES was not a normal user. She shoved the disc in so hard, the pin that was supposed to prevent this from happening was bent 90 degrees.  Remember on the 3.5 floppy disk, right side up, the top left corner was clipped? That's where the pin was. She broke the pin. (I found this later, but I already guessed what had happened)

And there is no way to retrieve her disc without taking the PC apart, remove the floppy drive, then remove the cover of the floppy drive to access the disc. The drive is probably f(bleep)ed. 

Remember, 4... no wait, now 6 people are waiting for PCs, and 2 people are trying to check out. 

Me: I am afraid you'll have to come back later. 

ES: But I need the disc for my homework! 

Me: Sorry, nothing I can do. 

I go back to the counter and checked out the two that are leaving, and checked in two more.  The third guy (TG) asked:

TG: What about that one? (pointed at the one ES broke)

Me: Sorry, it's out of order. 

TG: But she was just using it.    (Yep, he's been here a while)

Me: She broke it. 

TG gave ES a death stare, but otherwise did nothing. It took another 15-20 minutes for another machine to open up. I was about to ask TG for his student ID to check him in when ES approached. 

ES: I was here first. Aren't you going to give me another machine?

Me: What are you going to do without your disc? 

ES sputtered. Apparently, she forgot about her floppy. 

ES: Can you lend me one? 

TG gave her the death stare again, but ES ignored it. 

Me: Nope, don't have any.  Try the student union, maybe? 

I got TG checked in, made another PC available, then checked in the guy behind him. The line is still a couple students deep. 

ES: Well? 

Me: Well what? 

ES: What about my disc? 

Me: What about it? 

ES: Aren't you going to get it out for me?

Me: I'm not allowed to open up the machines. I'm just the lab assistant. 

ES stomped her feet and walked out. 

Me: ""You forgot your ID!"" 

She came back, snatched it from my hand, and marched back out.  I had to make an ""out of order"" sign on the machine AND the ID holder board to stop students, desperate for machines, from asking me ""why can't I use that one"". Though when one of them said he just need terminal access, I let him get on that machine. 

We did get her disc out later that day. As I explained earlier, it was shoved in upside down and bent the blocking pin sideways. We had to replace the entire floppy drive. 

She never came back to reclaim her disc.

//Slight edit for formatting

P.S. Wonder what she told her professor? That the lab ate her disc? ;)",1441,0,1
"Newbie solves a months-old head-scratcher problem in minutes, gets his victory dance","Or: the importance of a fresh pair of eyes on a problem.

During the team Zoom meeting earlier today, right at the end of the meeting in the 'any other business?' section, one of my colleagues (who's been there years, knows the datacentre inside out etc.) raises an important issue. Actually, two of them.

So we have a trio of Dell rack servers that are randomly shutting down. No rhyme or reason to it - during OS installs, under normal load, while doing nothing, 2 days, 2 hours, 2 weeks, totally random. Even more curious, the OS (RHEL) is shutting down, but there is absolutely no reason given - the system logs acknowledge the shutdown, but nothing before indicates what the reason is. They don't reboot, they shut down cold.

At this point, I've been with the company for 6 months as a Linux sysadmin, passed probation this month, but haven't really contributed a lot due to starting during COVID lockdown. So I offer my input, as I know Linux fairly inside-out by now. The boss acknowledges and offers the task to me.

I learn that the problem has been ongoing since August. There are two internal tickets involving several people, all trying different things - reinstalling the OS, dialling up the monitoring, upgrading the OS to the newer release, changes in the BIOS. Nothing seems to help. One of the trio came back immediately and has been fine since, but the other two continue to fail randomly. Tickets are raised with Dell. Dell request we run hardware diagnostics and send them the output. Dell draw a blank. They keep poking us asking if the machines are stable yet, clearly wanting to close the tickets, but we keep the tickets open and the servers keep crashing unpredictably.

So the first thing that springs to mind, me being fairly experienced with hardware as well, is that random shutdown problems are frequently temperature-related. One of the people involved in the problem also suggests temperatures. But there's nothing in the OS logs to suggest thermal shutdowns.

Well, they're rackmounts, let's go a level higher. Figure out which machine is which, then jump on the iDRAC (iLO) interface. Logs in it are equally sparse - the logs indicate shutdown occurred at the same time as the OS, but doesn't give a reason, just Reason SYS1003 for shutdown. Okay, how about temperatures?

There's a Thermals/Power tab, so that's my next stop. On the temperature monitor, everything looks normal. Interestingly, it logs the readings from the Intake Air Temperature for over a year. I download the complete logs as a CSV. Opening in LibreOffice, I see 3 columns - timestamp, average and peak degrees C for 1-hour intervals.

Without even scrolling down on the first machine, the problem is instantly visible. Line 1 after the headers:

`-128 -128 Thu Apr 21 10:01:05 2016`

Well that sure as heck doesn't look valid, does it.

Scroll down to the times indicated in the ticket. Right around the time the machine shuts down, guess what.

`-128 -128 Thu Aug 20 10:01:21 2020`

And there's hundreds of these readings. Scattered over 4 years of logs, but there, clear as day. Sometimes just once, sometimes for 12 hours straight.

So just like that, mystery solved - faulty temperature sensor. I open up the other two machines, and it's the same story. -128 degrees C right around each time the machines shut down. Evidently the iDRAC is receiving the faulty temperature signal, calculating that it's below the minimum threshold and sending an ACPI shutdown signal to the server.

I report my findings, update the tickets with the logs and sit back as people respond with surprise, both that Dell couldn't figure this out, and that they didn't notice. My total time spent for all 3 machines: &lt;15 minutes.

The original investigator goes back to Dell on the email thread and copy-pastes my diagnosis straight to them, cc'ing me, so I'll get to watch them squirm as well. I took a look at the hardware diagnostic file we sent to them - picking apart the .zip, sure enough I find Thermals.zip in one of the folders... and for reasons science cannot explain, the files within are *encrypted* \- I mean, what? Logs are all in plaintext, all the machine specs are in XML or JSON... but the temperature diagnostics are encrypted?

So for anyone wondering why Dell support is particularly hit and miss... and also how satisfying it is to jump in and solve a problem in minutes... I now know both pretty well...

Disaster strikes!,"So while I am not technically IT, I help our IT guy out from time to time.  I am one of the only 2 system administrators on our network.  I work in CNC in a manufacturing plant that makes plastics fasteners and our work system is an Oracle based database system.  One month ago, all hell broke loose.

A Monday evening, our IT lead gets a call from the second shift Quality Assurance lady.  She tells him that our system is acting funny and wont let her log in. He tries to remote into the server and is unable.  That's odd. So he remotes into another computer on the network and sees that someone has gained access to our server and is actively encrypting all our data.

Cue ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!""

I arrive the next morning and go to clock in and am told the server is down as is the entire network.  Cue me running to his office and find out that he has been there all night long.  He had arrived and immediately unplugged our modem and had spent most of the night figuring out what happened.

Turns out, one of our sales ladies fell for a phishing email and the first thing the outsiders did was delete our offsite backups and encrypt our on site ones. So we go into disaster recovery mode. Luckily our IT manager had a second offsite backup that was only a few months old.

Final tally, 30 computers wiped, 8 had Ubuntu installed and were raffled off once all company data was gone, 10 new PCs ordered and set up (including 2 in our CNC department), our domain controller and all users completely rebuilt from the ground up, an onsite backup to 2 2tb USB SSDs that are unplugged when its done, possible on site training for all employees for security, and about 3 and a half weeks of pure insanity.  Also my liver. We also tightened down user rights and severely limited user control over ANYTHING.

But the company bought me a good bottle of bourbon since IT isn't even my department! Also I may have acquired some hardware to build my wife a gaming PC.  I can neither confirm or deny anything. So yeah, it's been a crazy few weeks and I respect the hell out of you folks!",293,0,1

There are many quirks to this system (""We recommend you don't run this function, even if we told you to""), and it's a horrible mish-mash of contradictory ideas bolted together over the decades, and it's the worst system out there - except for all the rest. It's the only one that scales up enough to meet our needs that is designed specifically for the type of retail we are. All in all, it does what we need it to do, even if we want to light it on fire occasionally.

The old server was at the end of its life cycle, so we replaced it. The new server cost More Than My Car, not surprisingly. Because it is Very Important, we do nightly backups (with provisions to recover stuff that occurs to the day if we have to, but that's not part of this tale). The normal backups are to a network device, which, in turn, transfers an encrypted copy to the cloud run by the vendor we got this Very Important server that cost More Than My Car from. Sometimes, it doesn't work quite perfectly. So we have a backup tape drive. Normally, the tape drive is left turned off, but if we have issues, or think we might possibly have issues, or someone driving by on the street said the word issues, it's easy to turn back on. We're a little paranoid (from painful experience) about backups, so it is not optional.

So we replace this Very Important server that costs More Than My Car, and the new one, of course, includes a tape drive, and even included enough brand new tapes for a weekly cycle, plus a spare, and not one but *two* cleaners!. Very generous of them.

Except that when I start to label the tapes, it will label one, but not be able to read the label. And after that first time, it won't relabel the same tape, either, but will label another brand new one (but not read it afterwards). Various errors appear on the little tiny LED display on the front of the drive, including asking for the cleaning tape several times in the space of a half hour. Sigh.

Well, it's brand new, and we have the highest level of warranty available from the manufacturer, and a service contract that also costs more (per year) than my car. They'll make it work. Eventually. (And it's the backup to the backup, so to speak, so it's not exactly an emergency. So far.)

So our vendor remotes in and logs into the iDRAC system, and pokes and prods, and does tests, and consults with the tea leaves, and perhaps sacrifices a chicken to the Elder Gods, and decides that it is not, in fact, the wrong tapes (as they had originally thought), but just a bad (brand new, major brand name) drive. So they consult with the manufacturer, and do some more poking and prodding and reading of tea leaves, and perhaps move up to sacrificing a goat to the Elder Gods, and the manufacturer sends out a tech to replace the drive. This is basically what we expect, though it took longer than it should have (which is to day, it wasn't the same day).

I'm in the field at another location when the tech arrives, and my boss (bless his black heart), while more tech savvy than most, does not think to *test the drive* before the tech leaves (he, the boss (bless his black heart) that is, that is, was anxious to get the server back up and running, and the stores back online). I get back, and go to start labeling the tapes, and . . . they won't even go in the drive. No power LED on the front, nothing. Like it has no power. Sigh. I felt the odds were that the tech didn't get a cable plugged in quite right, but I wasn't going to open the case of a Very Important server that cost More Than My Car that was brand new with a factory warranty that was less than a week old.

So another call to the vendor, who calls the manufacturer, who arrange to send out another (different) tech. Just in case it was two bad drives in a row, they ship another replacement directly to us, which gets delayed in shipping, and is scheduled to arrive . . . half an hour after the store closes (which is to say, 9:30 PM), on a Friday, when weekends are the busiest days of the week. So I reschedule the tech's arrival with the dispatcher for early Monday. Ten minutes later, the tech calls, wondering if I knew that his arrival had been rescheduled, and why. Communications is a wonderful thing, and they should try some.

So Monday arrives, as does the tech (and 8:00 AM had become 11:00 AM), and I spend half an hour trying to track down the package that the shipper confirmed was delivered that morning (with a signature that matched one of our employees) - remember that 9:30 PM Friday delivery time? We're open both weekend days for longer hours than the shipper works - and we tell the stores to go offline for a short time for what should be a simple job.

A short time, indeed.

The tech opens the case, and sure enough, as soon as he touched the cable, it came off in his hand. The first tech hadn't plugged it in right (or, really, at all). Button the case back up, fire that baby up, and we have a power LED on the front of the drive! Whoopee! It takes a good ten minutes for it to go through the hardware checks and actually boot up, but the drive takes the tape. The tech agrees to hang out long enough for me to label a tape and read the label back to make sure everything is working. Except everything isn't working. The labeling program gets to where it's starting the process and . . . just sits there for *way* longer than it takes to label a tape. No error, no timeout, just sits there. Sigh.

We manage to deduce the new password (don't ask) for the iDrac and get logged into it, and we find no evidence of any tape drive anywhere (though neither of us really knew where to look), nor do I see it in the hardware configuration screen in the admin panel of the live server. So the tech calls for backup, an engineer of some sort at the manufacturer's internal support desk. And he's very knowledgeable. Perhaps too knowledgeable, and easily distracted by brightly colored objects (like the computer screen in front of him), and every on-topic thing he says leads to an aside to a tangent to an interesting factoid and so on. And he talks at . . . about . . . half . . . the . . . normal . . . speed . . . for . . . human . . . beings. But he knows where to look for the tape drive in the iDRAC.

Another reboot later, we can clearly see the drive in the iDRAC, so the hardware appears to be working correctly. But there's still no evidence of it in the admin panel on the live server. OK, I'm not actually all that surprised. It's not uncommon to have to manually reinitialize the drive within the backup software, which is well beyond my skillset (and the passwords I have), but something our vendor will handle with ease. Not the factory tech's problem, at any rate, and he has other calls. So after listening to the engineer give us the complete history of goat sacrifices, with an aside on the personality profiles of the Elder Gods and why the color purple is superior in all respects to the flavor of lima beans, we wrap it up and I let the tech go.

Within a few minutes of him leaving, I find the tape drive listed in the admin panel. Apparently, it will automatically recognize a hardware change, but requires a reboot afterwards to use the new setting, and still takes some time to get everything set up. (It's frustrating when I have no idea why something's not working, but it's terrifying when I have no idea why it *started* working again.) But it will now label the tape, and read the label. Victory over the Forces of Chaos at last!

So I turn on the tape backup for the final, real, only test that matters that night. Will it actually perform a backup? Come in the next morning, and . . . there's no backup in the log, not even a failed attempt. Sigh. This is becoming tedious.

But, before I spend a half hour digging through the logs, and bother our platinum account rep when I don't understand what I'm seeing, I notice that the backup history has transferred over from the old server, and that the last tape backup was on tape A. Which happens to be the same tape that was inserted. And, like any good backup system for a Very Important server that cost More Than My Car, that is the heart and soul of a multi-state retail chain that does many millions of dollars a year of business, it won't do a backup over (what it believes is) the most current tape, even if the actual tape in the drive is blank (and a different, and completely incompatible type).

So in the end, the backup failed *because* everything was working right.

(And now the main backups are failing sporadically because we're using the old server for training, and every time we plug it into the network, it messes up something relating to the network backup. Even though we have a) turned off the service, b) changed all the settings for the service to point to places that don't exist, and c) de-licensed the backup software. But at least the tape backups on the working server work now.)",482,0,1
The tale of the mysterious keyboard and the yoga ball mat,"This happened a few summers ago when I was a desktop support temp just trying to learn the ropes. Some users had desktops and others had laptops with docking stations depending on their role(important for the story). It doesn’t matter we support both.

This user had been having trouble for about a week(as far as we know) where their keyboard would mysteriously type random letters and numbers for no reason. She would be typing and random letters and numbers would show up too. The only way for her to fix it was for her to restart her computer and it would come back soon after. 

With this information from the user we started trouble shooting. There isn’t much you can do but reinstall the drivers or replace the keyboard. So that’s what we did, the drivers were replaced and it kept happening. That’s when I was sent with a few others to investigate this super weird issue on site.

This user had a standard setup with a laptop and docking station where a normal user would close the laptop and work off of the separate monitor and keyboard. She decided she liked the laptop keyboard better and the ability to use it as a second screen. 

When we approached it was difficult to keep from laughing since it was apparent what the problem was. The user had just bought a half yoga ball mat to rest her legs on. She had also decided since she didn’t like the separate keyboard that she would put it on the ground WHILE KEEPING IT PLUGGED IN. Which is how the yoga ball mat ended up on top of the keyboard.

Here is the theory: She would work and want to rest her legs so she would put them on the yoga ball mat which would press the keys when she moved it. Then she would get frustrated take her legs off the yoga ball mat to restart the laptop fixing the problem. And then restart the process. 

I will never get a better story than this",238,0,1
Client: It's the printer's fault!,"One of the clients that I had in the past used a customized database system to create/track invoices.  One day I get a call from one of their offices from a client complaining that something is wrong with their printer.

Me: What issue are you having with the printer?

User: It's printing the wrong information on the invoices that I'm generating.  It has the wrong date and address.  We moved to a new office about a month ago and it's still printing our old address! You need to fix the printer!

Me: Ok.  What is the invoice number that you are having issues with?  Also, I will need your new address so I can update it in the database.

User: It's the printer.  The printer name is CompanyX/Printer1234.

Me: That is not what I asked for.  I need the invoice number to see if there is a data entry error and your new address so I can update the database with it.

User: No! It's the printer that is the problem!  Fix the printer!

Needless to say, I had to go around this user to get the information I needed.  Checking the invoice, it was a data entry error by that user and after fixing that and updating their office's address in the database, the invoice printed with the correct information.  The person probably still thinks that it was the printer to this day.",367,0,1
"It's not your alarm, man!","Hey, guys! Back with another fun security tech story. This happened just last (Sunday) night, and will be filed under my more interesting on-call memories. This is also posted in r/talesfromsecurity. 

Received a service ticket for a house the company monitored which was sold last year. The alarm monitoring account was deactivated by the new homeowner. He's been using it as  a glorified door chime. But, for some reason which was never really made clear, he needed the disarm code. 

Prior to contacting the homeowner, I was told by one of our dispatchers that he was calling the previous owner for her code. After allowing him time to do this, I called... with him claiming he was not aware that was even an option. I allowed him more time to do this, and he promised to call back after he gets the code.

We managed to silence the system, but he tells me that every 10-15 seconds there is a sequence of four long beeps. It's hard for me to hear over the phone, but I did catch it every so often. He's convinced it's one of his smoke detectors, but all of my records show that they are hardwired, so there would be no low battery warning.

I asked if he is using the same type of phone as I am, so we can video chat, as the audio and video together might be helpful. He agreed, and we spent nearly half an hour troubleshooting every possibility. Nothing works.

Finally, in utter desperation, I happened to mention that I have had calls in the past where the issue is completely unrelated to our alarm system. He said, ""wait a minute, I think it might be..."", as he walked back to where the beeps were the loudest.

I heard a cabinet open. ""I think it's my microwave!"" I am floored. It took everything in me to not burst into laughter. He repeated, ""Yeah, I think it's my microwave."" I just heard some beeps, as all I could see was the ceiling and the very top of his head. Internally, in that moment, I am both laughing and screaming. I apologized that we did not realize this earlier, and I ended the call politely and professionally, wishing him a good night.

I immediately began laughing so hard, my lungs hurt and I feared I might pass out from oxygen deprivation. My wife, sitting about six feet from me, and had heard the entire video call, began to laugh along with me. I called the dispatcher to advise that the issue was resolved, and that we ended up troubleshooting his microwave.

All in all, it was a good night.

EDIT: We confirmed that the smokes which were installed are indeed hardwired to the panel, which runs off the household electrical service, and the only battery involved is a 12V brick inside the panel. The only troubleshooting step we did not cover was if the power had gone out at all, as this happening was never mentioned.",703,0,1
Your software is making all of our computers beep. How do we make it stop?,"We received a support ticket from a customer who stated that our software was causing all of their computers to beep and they needed to know what to do to make it stop. We went back and forth a few times with them trying to diagnose things via the support ticket system but nothing made sense . Out software only produces a sound when an error or alert appears and you'd only hear it if you had a sound card and speakers. We decide it's time to call them so I get on the phone.

I give them a call and sure enough, you can hear loud beeping. It sounds familiar but I can't quite identify it so I start asking basic troubleshooting questions. They tell me there's no speakers and that the computers have never made sound before so just to be sure I ask them to look at the back of the computer and see if there is a sound card and if anything plugged in to it. 

Well, well, well, this is where I finally get my answer. She tells me that she can't see behind the computer because the power is out and it's really dark. That's when that familiar sound finally makes sense! Their UPSs were beeping at them. What the heck? We're almost 30 minutes into this from the first support ticket and this is the first time I'm hearing that the power is out. How did they not think this would important information to share? I never even thought to ask because I just assume it's something you share right away. One I told her what I thought was making the sound she laughed and admitted to me that she felt really dumb. I had her shut down all the workstations until they could get their power sorted out.",2669,0,1
"My laptop vibrates, even when it’s off. You must send a technician right away!","In the mid-90s I did Mac tech support for schools and businesses in Chicagoland. Our biggest clients were the public school systems. I had to dispatch our technicians to some pretty awful school environments, but today’s call came from one of the wealthiest school districts. Their lead Mac person was very competent, and could solve most problems by following the steps I told her over the phone. This was not one of them. 

She called me in a panic early Monday morning to say that her PowerBook (that’s a laptop, kids) was vibrating, and she didn’t know why.

“Is it making unusual noises?” “No.”

“Is the hard drive spinning wildly?” “No.”

“Does it happen when you shut the lid?” “Yes.”

*Hmm.*

“Does it happen when you shut it down completely?” *”Yes.”*

“Is it on a desk, table, or podium?” “A table.”

“Is the table pushed up against the wall?” *”Yes.”*

*”Does it stop if you pull the table a few inches from the wall?”* **”Yes!”**

*”Does it stop if you pick it up off the table?”* **”Yes!!!”**

I looked at the calendar on the wall. October. 

I checked the temperature outside. 50s. 

“Did the school’s heat turn on for the first time this school year?”

*Pause*

“Oh, I am *so* stupid!” she cried. “The table was shoved up against the radiator!”

I didn’t bill her for the call. I knew that I’d be milking that story for years to come. :)",924,0,1

Floppy Disk Mail is as good as Email.,"We had a customer once who couldn't get one of their workstations logged into the software. It's urgent, they need to prepare for a busy weekend and they need to get this resolved  as soon as possible. They're unable to tell us what errors, if any, are appearing. Why? Who knows, sometimes customers are stubborn and want you to fix it without any effort on their end. They don't want to provide us with a remote connection so we ask them to email us some information about the application launcher settings, and they promise to get it to us right away. 

We didn't hear from them again so we assumed they solved the problem on their own. Until about a week later when a padded envelope arrives. Inside this envelope is a 3.5"" floppy disk that had just a little bit of dried food on it. But that's all there was, just some dried food, no note, no label, just dried food and a return address we don't recognize. We stick this in our electronics junk yard to be tossed out.

A few days later we get an angry call from the customer wanting to know why their workstation isn't working yet. We explain that we never received an email from them or a call saying they still needed help. This is when we're told that their tech guy got the information we needed and emailed it. When we tell them that we didn't receive anything from then they call the tech guy and discover that rather than email us, he put the info we needed on a floppy disk and mailed it.

So here we are almost 2 weeks after the initial issue that had to be solved before that weekend. We get an OLD computer, unplug it from the network, and put the floppy in to see what's going on. The tech guy copied the shortcut onto the floppy disk and that's all. When we tell them that they haven't provided us with the information we need and that the fastest way to help them is to provide us remote access, they call the tech guy back in. He shows up the next day and to get us connected, he had to connect this computer to the network so it has internet access. I'll say that again, HE HAD TO CONNECT THE COMPUTER TO THE NETWORK. 

Yeah, the only problem they had was that the network cable had been unplugged. In all these years I've seen just about kind of person claiming to be an IT professional. This is the first and only time we had received a floppy disk in the mail as an alternative to email.",1503,0,1
"Downtime is costly, but not worth a small investment","I work with a customer who runs a series of fast food restaurants. These restaurants are a well known franchise and very successful. At one of the locations, the internet quality is poor. This prevents credit card and giftcards from being processed. Their POS supports offline processing but it doesn’t allow customers to use the app to pay nor does ApplePay/AndroidPay or giftcards. We’ve offered the them a wireless backup option and also a second internet company with automatic backup. Cost would be about $160 a month. Apparently this is too much even though they supposedly loose hundreds of dollars in sales because of outages. They’re trying to get their ISP to pay for it LOL.",1310,0,1
Sales Tax... of DOOM,"This story happened shortly after a major natural disaster in my area. Not related to the disaster itself but the event set in motion the events of this story.

In the aftermath, the state I was in decided to add a half cent ""temporary"" sales tax to fund infrastructure repairs (side grumble, 30 years later that temporary tax is still in place). 

Since I was working in Point of Sales, I had the ridiculous job of going to ALL of my companies customers to reprogram their machines for the new sales tax. Our customer base covered most of the north part of our state so it was a huge job.

This one in particular stands out. 

As I walk through the door the store owner is already yelling at me. He's mad because its been a week since the tax change went into effect and we are only just getting to him. On top of that he's livid that my company is charging him for the call.

Well, I can't help the first part because we had to do some triage. Our big store multi register clients got priority. His little two register mini mart just had to wait a bit.

The second part, I kind of agreed with. The company should have at least been giving discounts. As it was it came across as gouging even though we didn't raise our rates. But maintaining the one hour minimum for a five minute service call was kind of a dick move. In any case that wasn't my call.

So with the owner glaring over my shoulder I enter the new program and save it. Then I print out the program to confirm its in correctly. The receipt printer starts up and then ""POOF"", the machine dies and all the magic blue smoke comes out.

Owner was beyond livid. Blames my program entry for destroying his cash register, and since I had just exploded his machine as I was programming it I really couldn't refute the argument!

So I get my kit from the truck and open up the machine. Turns out that the printer motor was on its very last legs. Brushes had worn down so far that they eventually shorted out. Lucky me it happened just as I started my print!

I explained this to the owner and showed him the failed part. Then I replaced the printer and got the machine running again. Didn't even charge him for the part. 

Even so the owner refused to believe my programming didn't kill his machine and wouldn't let me program the second machine. I later discovered he eventually called in a competitor from the neighboring service region to finish the job.

So that's how my malicious programming skills lost us a customer. I only WISH I had that power!",368,0,1

The laser sharp Spec (ft. the world’s most comprehensive KB),"So, at my work there’s a department with manufacturing equipment and so there’s a specialist there to keep them running &amp; help people using them. This is a newly created role for that year as the former department head (HoD) used to do it themselves. The department is quite small, 2 core staff (now 3) with several hundred other users each month. I won’t give specifics about why there’s hundreds of users needing a specialist and 2 other core staff as I don’t want to blow my account &amp; it isn’t risky enough for a throwaway or alt.

One piece of equipment is a laser cutter made by an Austrian based international manufacturer of, believe it or not, laser cutters, laser engravers and laser markers, whose name rhymes with turtleneck. This cutter uses a program to control jobs to be cut and lay them out on the plate to make best use of the material. You import a job into this control software by printing it from your design software to a software printer that converts it to a the control format.

On this fateful day the specialist (Spec) calls in a ticket to our fabulous onsite IT helpdesk to let us know about the computer that drives this laser cutter is slow to log on/off (site wide problems atm) and generally lethargic plus unusual problems with the control software. Requesting it to be rebuilt.

I swing by towards the end of the day and get to work finding out what is wrong specifically (why do people never tell you specifically what’s up in the first place?). After dropping by his office ( material store room) I find out it is flagging an error about not being able to fit a single job on the plate. He say’s that he used this machine type and the design software in his last place, knowing both inside out. So I log on with a fresh (factory new) test account, turn on the laser machine and sit in the wind tunnel produced by 4 140mm fans blowing onto the laser driver engine thingy (where laser is made laser), someone really needs to make a baffle to protect you from that jet blast, but I digress.

I am able to replicate the error, so do what any tech worth their salt does when faced with an unfamiliar error, consult the greatest knowledge base known to mankind - Google. 1st result is the manufacturer’s website with a list of common errors and causes. Guess what it’s there, that fault code. ‘Workpiece is bigger than space available on plate, check workpiece size’. I know my beautiful drawing of a small circular is way smaller than the 300 x 450 plate, possibly 10x10mm?. Like I said above it is imported by printing it into the software - I vaguely remember the old HoD showing me where you adjust the print size while testing after I migrated this box over to win10 last year, the print properties. You see it defaults to 500x500, all you do is tick the box to match the size of the work piece to the size of the design an click ok. So I do that and lo and behold it works. I communicate this over and log off.

I am chatting to the DepHoD (other core staff member) a week later about troubles with MS teams and the damned WIFI, when I ask if there’s been any other troubles with the laser cutter since. And no there haven’t, I tell him I just googled it and he remarks that the Spec does have a tendency to claim to know everything there is to know about everything. I’m sure we’ll meet again some day, probably when complaining about the router not working (not the internet router, but the CNC one. And fellow brits, this one is pronounced the American way (ra-oww-tor) instead of  proper way (root-er).)

Ridiculous Expectations,"Received a call today from a customer who recently purchased software (Office365) through our online store. They wanted to know when we’d be installing the software. I explained I could assist with downloading and installing the application but that we don’t actually do it for customers. The guy seemed like this was unreasonable and actually expected us to install the Office applications on 60 computers in their office. 

He was like “what am I paying you $900 a month for”? I explained that’s for email, office applications, and other collaboration tools like Teams. His response was “well how do I use them if you dont install them?!?”  

Where the hell do these people come from? What software do you buy and the reseller come to your office and install it? Except expensive specialty software that’s requires thousands in professional services to get up and running. If he bought office from Walmart would he have expected them to install it for him?",267,0,1
Your software caused a fire and we need you to pay for damages.,"A customer who uses our software had never ending network issues called us threatening legal action if we didn't reimburse them for damages resulting from a fire. This was a small restaurant and one workstation was always freezing, needing to be rebooted, its connected printers never worked, etc. We always recommended they hire an IT professional to come out and check the computer and network connection and one day they finally did.

The only problem was that this IT professional was the restaurant owner's brother and was neither knowledgeable in IT nor professional. In the course of his troubleshooting, a fire started inside the wall near the network jack and they had to smash the wall to get to it and put it out, at least that's the story they gave me. In his professional opinion, our software had sent several high voltage pulses through the network and caused the fire. 

I tried explaining to the restaurant owner that what she was telling me was impossible and she got irate and I assume started yelling at me in Hindi and after I tell her I can't understand her she tells me she'll have her brother call me and hangs up. A few minutes later her brother calls and he starts yelling at me and wanting an apology for calling him a liar and that he has a PhD and he knows exactly what happened. He gives me the same story, that our software sent out this high voltage pulse and started a fire. I'm not even sure where to begin with a rebuttal so I just use my standard question when speaking to a incompetent IT guy, ""Have you consulted with an IT professional?"" This set him off in the most glorious way and after yelling and cussing at me for a bit he hangs up.

About a week later the restaurant owner calls and says she has a new computer and wants our assistance installing the software on it. No mention of the previous incident at all, it's like it never even happened I guess. I wonder if she got a second opinion and realized her brother is a failure.",3306,0,1
Your software's security flaws cost us thousands of dollars!,"This customer used one of our software packages and when they added another workstation, they chose to do it themselves and rather than deal with an IT professional, they shared out C: on each computer to everyone. By the way, they were using very old all in one touchscreen machines running Windows 98. Summer comes along and they decide to offer free internet to their guests via WiFi and so they put an unsecured access point in a common area and attach that access point to their network. That same network at isn't in the least bit secure. Shortly after this we get a call wanting us to figure out why their software has stopped working. They're a pretty close drive for one of our employees so they head on over the next morning and discover that not only is our software missing, but so is nearly everything else. In the root of C: there's a new readme.txt and it explains that the person who did this was just driving by looking for unsecured WiFi and wanted to teach them a lesson. 

The owner of this business had a lawyer send us a really nasty letter explaining how we were negligent in allowing our software to operate like this and that we were responsible for the costs of having an IT Professional recover this data and for loss of business. We sent the lawyer back support ticket notes and emails showing that the customer chose to install on their own and also that we had provided installation instructions that clearly state how important data security is and to never do the things they did. We also recommended the layer contact an IT professional and get their opinion on giving guests unrestricted access to an unsecured network of outdated computers running operating systems that had reached their end of life years prior. 

We never heard back from the lawyer but the business owner called us to have us do the software install on all new, up to date computers. He had also hired an IT professional to oversee things. That was an expensive lesson for him.",597,0,1
"Your software keeps uninstalling itself, we want a refund.","This customer refused to get training after purchasing almost every product we have. We provide a certain window of free support just to make sure they get running smoothly even if they don't want proper on site training, which isn't free so the cheap customers never get it.

About a month after the free support ends we start getting calls that the software has uninstalled itself. We connect remotely and reinstall, get them set up, restore the data from a backup, etc. This goes on for a couple months, almost every week. That's when the owner calls and wants a conference call with management to discuss a refund.

I'm on the call and this is my first time hearing about it so I request remote access to check some things out. When our software uninstalls, it logs all the details and takes screenshots. And there, in a folder that isn't the install folder, I check the logs. Their ""IT Professional"" who was the owner's nephew was logging in and uninstalling, clicking all the ""OK"" and ""Are You Sure"" buttons. The owner yelled at us for snooping and being unethical but they didn't get a refund. The Owner didn't seem shocked or even try to deny it so I'm sure he had devised this as a plan to get a refund because he didn't want to take the time to learn how to use the software.",343,0,1
Got waylaid by vampires...,"An earlier post reminded me of this...

Back in the early 2000's I worked for a hardware manufacturer as a field service flunky.

We used early Blackberries to receive service calls and send messages to our call tracking system when we arrived at a customer location, and when we left. I would also include such nuggets of information as ""replaced thus and such component"" to jog my memory when closing out my service calls.

One day I was visiting one of the locations for our largest customer, and they were having a Red Cross blood drive in one of their conference rooms. So when I was leaving, I stopped and gave blood.

In my offsite message I mentioned that I'd been waylaid by vampires on my way out.

The following week I was talking with one of the managers at the corporate headquarters about something and he said ""what did you mean last week by being waylaid by vampires?""

That's how I found out that at least one person would read the contents of the notes on service calls. It didn't stop me from putting in things to amuse myself, though. :)",249,0,1
There's a flashing orange light and a strange smell.,"This customer had a workstation that may have been a gaming PC at one time because it had a clear panel on the side. One of the employees calls us saying they can't get the computer to turn on and that every time they press the power button there is a weird orange flashing light that sparkles a bit and then it turns off again. She also mentions a strange smell but can't quite describe it. We provide software only, not hardware services so we advise them to contact their IT professional and to not touch that power button again.

A couple hours later we get a call from someone who tells us that the computer is fried and they need to do install the software on a new computer. That flashing orange light was apparently some chip getting so hot it was glowing. The smell was both that chip burning and the massive layer of sticky dust catching fire. I hear they perform regular maintenance on their equipment now.",228,0,1
Sometimes words reappear where you don't expect it ...,"Back when we still had humans watching monitoring rather than automated processes, I got a call at oh-dark hundred from the Operator that went something like this:

""I've got a critical alert for $server, is that one for you?""  
""Yeah, I'll have a look.  &lt;yawn&gt;""

I don't remember what the specific issue or resolution was, other than probably something had hung and I probably reset it from VMware.

After I'd checked it was all working, I did the courtesy update via SfB:

smellykaka: I kicked the server in the nuts, and it seems to be working now.  
Operator: OK, thanks!

and then I went back to zzzzzzzz-land. Later that day, in a moment of boredom I looked at the morning's ops report. In the entry for the callout in question, upon looking across to the Operator comments column I found:

""smellykaka kicked the server in the nuts, and it's working now.""",765,0,1
Excel and printing.,"Back when I did field service on desktops, laptops, printers, and other computer related equipment, I got a service call about a printer at one of our biggest customers.

The issue was that this one person, when printing a specific Excel worksheet, the shaded cells would no longer print the text inside the shading.

The printer in question was an HP LaserJet 5si, and was usually pretty bulletproof for these kinds of things.

Since it would only reproduce with the one person, with one Excel worksheet, it shouldn't be a hardware issue (thus appropriate for me), but I dove into it anyway.

The worksheet was huge (at the time) and pulled data via ODBC from many varied sources and then massaged the data.

I did the trick of copying the data and pasting into a new spreadsheet file. Issue reproduces.

Created a new spreadsheet, shaded some cells, added text, prints fine with no issue.

I installed the LaserJet 4si printer drivers, and printed the problem spreadsheet, and the issue was gone.

So the work around of using the driver for an older model of printer was the fix, but it took a couple of hours to get there. We billed the customer anyway, for something their own desktop support folks should have done.",103,0,1
One Excel workbook crashed my PC...,"So, I'm not tech support, I'm just a regular desk jockey. However, I'm not an idiot. I've got an A+ and a Network+ and had a couple of old MS certs that have expired. Since I'm one of the few people that have some tech skills, I sometimes get to fix stuff that's broken. Sometimes I fix stuff if it annoys me enough. I have a co-worker who is 15 years younger than I am and has two college degrees that has no idea how a computer works. I got my first PC after I graduated from high school in the early 90's. I should be the old man that doesn't understand computers.

Well, we're all working from home and doing our duties. I get to be backup for those duties. Simple things that are less than one person's job but easy to do. Plus, somebody has to do these type of things while people take PTO. Backup duties get handed around. Several of us cover for each other. Today, my co-worker asks me to cover for her on the big client. She's had PC issues. A lot of PC issues. Her friend is coming over at lunch to figure them out.

One of them is easy to diagnose. (Bad inverter cable or bad inverter board itself.) Her friend is coming over to figure out why it flickers and why it runs so slowly. She asks me to run the big client today. No problem. Make some support tickets if any show up, check on the current support tickets, and keep the big client informed. Keep the big client happy. So, I check my folders in Outlook and download yesterday's Excel workbook. The workbook is the daily report that we send them. Sure, it's simple, but it works. Then I open the workbook...

It takes four minutes and a GB of RAM. I have no idea why. I keep poking around trying to figure out if it's infected. Is it running some weird formula? Some crazy reference? I don't really know Excel as well as I should. I complain to her about the workbook in Teams. By this time, her friend has showed up, she's going to lunch to get her PC inspected, and I start working on this stupid Excel workbook.

She comes back from lunch. She's getting a new screen and he removed some bloatware. I ask, ""Do you use these tables?""

""What's a table?""

This workbook has seven total sheets. Two for current issues, and the rest are past five months. All months before that have been moved to a second workbook. Of course, both of them combined are too large to email, so they have to be zipped up to be sent every day.

I look at the sheets and each one has a table maxed out. About 65,000 rows and the columns go to triple letters. I message the boss about this workbook. He says, ""Actually, that's probably just the one that I made for her. She's probably still using the same one."" He clearly just clicked the upper left corner and tabled the whole stupid thing.

So, I go to the last two sheets and un-table them. The file gets bigger. As I un-table the third sheet, Excel freezes. I watch in task manager as it slowly climbs up to 2.5 GB of RAM. My fan sounds louder than I've ever heard it. Force reboot. Tables are pretty good at storing formatting according to the Googles. Having infinite formatting without tables is quite hard on Excel, I guess. That also explains why the file got larger. It explains why it was worse even though I was saving it in between edits.

At that point, a friend of mine comes up with the simplest solution. Make a new workbook and copy\\paste the data over. I'd been wrestling with this thing for hours. I'm an idiot for trying so hard. I do just as he advised. I format the cells out to 500 rows and about a hundred columns and freeze the top row. Whole thing takes about a hour while doing my regular work. At most, this thing has 166 rows of data. This thing is so sloppy that I realize there are actually about 200 worthless columns hidden in the middle of it.

In the end, she's excited that I kept her ""easy to read"" formatting and added back the old months. Even with the added five months of data, I reduced the size of the workbook from 91 MB to 818 KB. I should know better than this. When trying to fix a problem, it really can boil down to one simple Excel workbook screwing up the whole PC. Even the smallest glitch can kill the whole system if it grows big enough and carries on long enough.",284,0,1
I don't need no password,"So this is my second post and  a long one so I'm just gonna run down some encounters and summarize what i can

So this is still around the same timeline 2012-2013 
As i was still working as a techsupport for the roku device

This encounter was between Entitled Customer hereby designated as EC and Me designated Me, and  her teenage daughter designated as TD

Me: thank you for calling roku support this is williamtold21 how may I help you?

*With some sort of southern drawl ( cannot for the life of me remember what type of accent right now)

EC: yeah uhm yer device ain't connecting to my internet.

Me: ok maam so your device will not connect to your wifi is that right?

EC: did I stutter?

Me: no maam i am just checking if i understood your concern correctly, now where was this device purchased?

EC: I bought it at *shopping center* 

Me: ok maam now just to check what message is displayed on your tv screen right now?

EC: It says ""incorrect password cannot connect.""

Me: ok thanks so...I think we can easily get through this by typing the password to your wifi

Cue EC entitlement and ....

EC: So whats the password?

Me: confused pause, I'm sorry maam I don't quite follow

EC: look poindexter I'm paying for internet connection and I AM A VALUED CUSTOMER so don't waste my time and give me my damn password

Me: uhh maam that password would be what you and your family uses to connect to your wifi, we do not set that as our support is only for the roku device not your internet service.

EC: Don't give me that, just give me my damn password and stop wasting my time! I don't need to know my password coz I paid for it and have always been connected to the wifi in my own house so if this is some type of ploy to get me to fork over more money for a g¥$$amn password you got another thing comin.

Wild teenage daughter appears

TD: Mom! Put the phone down now!

EC:But this little poindexter is tryin ta get me to pay....

TD: No he is not now put the phone down.

EC: But...

TD: Now mom or I'm calling Dad

*click* ( i'm assuming this is a landline extension)

TD: I'm sorry about that my mom is technologically challenged

Me: *explains what happened as per our conversation and how to set up the roku device

TD: Ok i can set it up if that was the only problem, thanks.

End of call

TLDR:Technologicall challenged Customer gets put in place by her Teenage Daughter

Apparently I'm polite but useless.,"Years back, I was working for a small, struggling company. We made software that helped nonprofits track, thank, and encourage their donors, so our clients were generally small nonprofits with limited tech skill but real passion for whatever their organization did. This was the one tech job I've ever had where nobody swore at me.

This is the story of my worst caller.

Neville (not his name, of course) ran a small museum in an eastern state (of the USA). He had a fairly small donor database, which he used once a year. Every year, he would call us up to complain that the FLOPPY DISKS that he stored his database on had failed. Again. Which was of course our fault.

Did he have a backup? Oh, you sweet summer child.

His organization's record was populated with annual complaints that we had lost his database, followed by our begging him to burn a CD, or send us his data, or use decent backups. Each entry was signed by the tech who worked with him, and a heartfelt plea to never talk to him again.

I was new that year, and didn't know what was coming. It **was** a bit odd that all the other techs were hanging out at my cube door watching me. I think I saw a few exchanging money- bets.

Neville spent ten minutes explaining how useless our software was, with a few jabs towards my intelligence and education. I made interested noises as I mostly ignored his ranting and read the file.

I knew what he was going to want before he even finished griping. And I was right.

""So I want you to fix this data thing!""

Floppy number four of seven had failed (as they do) and the only copy of his datafile was corrupt. Our software had no tools with which to recover a datafile with a big bite taken out of the middle. He had no backup, despite four recorded pleas in his file to back things up. I don't know if he stored his floppies in a magnet co0llection or what, but this was what he called about every year.

I talked him through the basics. Try a different computer, maybe that drive is faulty. I could hear him not moving out of his chair and not trying another computer as he assured me that he was doing that.

I asked if there was another copy somewhere? (didn't use the word 'backup' because I was trying to speak his language). He snorted.

I asked how many donors he had added this year? He had, after all, sent the data file to us (every year) so we had last year's file. Nope. He wasn't sure if he had added any new donors but he wanted THIS file, not last year's.

I was trying to figure out how to walk him through undeleting the file on his hard drive, where he thought he might have worked on it some months ago, when he lost patience.

""You are useless! Polite, but useless."" SLAM goes the phone.

The lead tech ostentatiously looked at her watch and held out her hand to her junior, who passed over a ten. Apparently I had kept him from hanging up for longer than the rest had expected.

I documented it and added my plea to never, ever talk to Neville again to his file, and closed it for this year.

&amp;#x200B;

(Apart from this guy, I loved working at that company. Every day I was helping cure cancer, open libraries in inner cities, keep animal shelters open, etc. It was really fun and satisfying to work there.

Alas, the CEO had a clothing malfunction with his secretary, and had to sell the company during the split-the-assets dance with his wife. The company got sold to our huge, soulless competition and closed down.)",136,0,1
"Mam, that's a faraday cage.","This one happened to me today and I can not stop laughing at it.

Phone call regarding wifi not working in a lady's room but works everywhere else in the house. 

&gt; $Me = Zach from campfire stories (look it up)   *People keep asking, I am not him. Just read my lines in his voice.*
&gt; $CU = Clueless User  or some snooty art girl

&gt; $Me - Thanks for calling IT may I have your name please?  
&gt; $CU - Its Clueless User.  

I input her name into the thing and it pops up red indicating a VIP who expects to be given whatever she wants. She usually gets it too. 

&gt; $ME - So how may I help you today?  
&gt; $CU - So this will sound really weird and crazy, but I swear my wifi does not work right. Everywhere else I can work just fine, but as soon as I bring it home, it just stops working.  

Oh fun one of THESE calls. Probably an all metal house or an old as dirt house. 

&gt; $Me - So is it everywhere in your house?  
&gt; $CU - Yes... NO actually last night I worked while watching netflix on the tv in the living room and had zero issues.  
&gt; $Me - Well thats a good place to start. Lets go into your living room and test the wifi.  
&gt; $CU - Sure thing. 

We test the wifi in every room in her house and find that the signal degrades significantly the instant she steps into her room. 

&gt; $Me - OK this is going to sound like some James Bond scifi stuff but I bet something in your room is causing EM interference. Have you moved anything new into the room? I mean anything. A lamp, a microwave, coffee maker, mini fridge, or even non electronic stuff like metal?  
&gt; $CU - Who has a mini fridge in their room? (Laughs)  
&gt; $Me - I actually keep drinks in mine by my desk while I work.   
&gt; $CU - Oh. Well there is nothing like that. Plus the router is in the other room. Only thing over there are my art projects.  
&gt; $Me - OK. I am reaching WAY out there now. Is there a lot of metal content in that wall?  
&gt; $CU - No but there is a lot of metal on it.  
&gt; $Me - How so? You do metal work for your art?   
&gt; $CU - No I use it to hang my art.  
&gt; $Me - Its probably not it, but lets go ahead and send me a picture of it. I doubt that is whats causing it but might as well send me a picture.   

She takes the picture and sends it to me. In a roughly 6x8 foot section of her wall is a mounted chain link fence with these little cut up coke cans as art hanging off of it. It took me a full minute looking at the absurdity of the picture in front me when the light came on. 

&gt; $Me - Mam, that's a faraday cage. Well... sort of.   
&gt; $CU - What is a faraday cage.   

I hear from the background. ""I TOLD YOU!"" 

&gt; $CU - Ignore that, thats my son. We keep yelling at him to move the modem and router into our room but he says the fence is the problem.  
&gt; $Me - Well to be honest, it kinda is.  No its not kinda, it definitely is.  
&gt; $CU - Huh?  
&gt; $Me - So a faraday cage is what is used to block signals. Basically any linked metal cage can create a field where signals have trouble passing through.  
&gt; $CU - This is that James Bond crap you were talking about?  
&gt; $Me - I mean kinda? Its not a full faraday cage because its just 1 side. Its why your wifi works but constantly cuts out and stays at half strength. A faraday cage has to actually enclose something to properly shield it from radio and em waves. But that chain link fence is in direct line of sight with the router.  
&gt; $CU - I... don't see how that is possible. It makes no sense. But you, my husband, and my 16 year old son all say the same thing. They all say moving that to the garage will solve my problems.   
&gt; $Me - I agree with your assessment.  
&gt; $CU -  Are you willing to put your job on it? 

She had me stay on hold for 30 minutes as she got her husband and son to move the art and fence to the garage. 

&gt; $CU - Ok I am back. Pulling the ethernet cable... Huh that was fast. It instantly connected to the wifi.   
&gt; $Me - OK lets get connected again.   

Ran ping test with -t -l 1400 and had zero dropped pings. Before it was every 3rd one. Speed test gave her the full speed for her area. 

&gt; $CU - That was strange, well it is working now. How often you think this happens?     
&gt; $Me - I can legitimately state that I have never once run into this issue in my entire career.  
&gt; $CU - Seriously?  
&gt; $Me - Yup. Now I have run into weird things before.  
&gt; $CU - Like what?  
&gt; $ME - (All true stories.) In my parent's house, if you stand in the laundry room on wifi and I open both the fridge and freezer door in the kitchen, your phone will lose wifi connection. I had a friend who had to move his router 5 feet because a new lamp his mom loved was causing line of sight interference with his laptop. And my uncle decided to build an all metal house. Metal beams, metal roofing, and metal doors. He gets zero reception inside his house and has to run ethernet cables all over his home.   
&gt; $CU - So would running this ethernet cable through the wall be a better solution?  
&gt; $Me - Infinitely better.

And then they scattered.,"The year was 2012. I was working in mobile device sales at a large retailer. I also had a side gig doing freelance PC and home/consumer network support. One of my coworkers, a middle-aged man, caught wind of this and sought my assistance. 

Coworker: I just have the one computer at home and it has been turning off randomly. 
Me: As in, black screen, full shut down, no warning while doing ordinary stuff? 
Coworker: Yes - no specific program or anything that I’m running, happens at random. 
Me: Sounds like a hardware issue unfortunately but I’ll have a look at it. 

We agreed that he would bring the PC to the workplace since it was convenient for both of us. 

Typically I was doing this kind of work for upper-middle class suburbanites. In this instance, knowing roughly what my coworker was making, I offered to attempt a diagnosis and repair for free. I had spare parts around with minimal resale value. Unfortunately, no amount of payment could justify what I was to encounter...

(Some days later) 
Coworker: I brought the PC today, it’s in my car. 
Me: Ok, I’ll move it to my car.
(Go to coworker’s car - there is a thick black garbage bag in the back)
Coworker: the PC is in that bag. 
Me: Why is it in a bag? 
Coworker: I have a little roach problem and didn’t want to spread them in case any are inside.
Me: Ok, that makes sense. I’ll open it outdoors. 

I took the PC tower (still in the bag) home, put it at the end of my driveway, and cut the bag away. A couple roaches were indeed loose in the bag and scurried off. A couple more dead ones were in the bag with the tower.

Thinking the worst was over, I put the tower on its side and removed the side cover.

And then they all scattered. Hundreds. Tiny and medium sized roaches. Their exodus spread in a circle around the case like the shockwave of some organic explosion. I danced and jumped to avoid them. All escaped - except for the dead ones that had been shorting various components out and causing the black screens. They stayed behind and were delivered back to my coworker still in the case, in a fresh garbage bag, along with my recommendation to throw the whole thing away and buy some Raid for his home.",362,0,1
Client's Complains of Sudden Internet Instability/Dropped Connections.,"I had a client who has been working from home since the COVID lockdowns began.  For the most part, her internet connection has been fine but for about a week, it kept dropping on her laptop.

Me: Are other members of your household having this problem?

Client: No. Just me.

Me: How far are you from the WiFi router?

Client: Usually, I'm right next to it as it is in my home office but I started letting my kids use the office for their classes and have been working from another room.

Me: Did you start having connection issues around the same time you made this switch?

Client: Why yes.  How did you know?

Me: It's likely that you are too far from the router for the signal to get to you.

Client: But that's impossible.  My husband bought and set up a repeater to boost signal.

Me: Where is the repeater?

Client: Right next to the router.

Me: (Face palm) Move the repeater to an area about halfway or so from the other room you are working in.  It can't extend the range of the signal if it's in the same room at the router.

Client moves repeater and viola....weak WiFi issues go away. 

It baffles me that the husband apparently knew how to configure the repeater but had no idea on how to place it to actually be effective.",221,0,1
"Error 12.79 (User Error, with denial)","This was 1994-5, desktops were still Dells running Windows 3.1 on a Novell 3.x IPX network. 

Get a call from the help desk, user is saying their computer “stopped working”.  The user in question is a pretty high maintenance user.  Very picky, always drops the name of the VP of IS to try to get her way. 

Get there and yep, windows is completely hosed. Throws all kinds of errors on start up.  The user claims “she was just working on things and the computer stopped working” and that “she didn’t do anything wrong”. 

So I investigate the windows errors.  Lots of missing DLLs.

I find them.  All put neatly in C:\DLLs.  And then I find C:\COM, C:\EXE, and C:\BAT.

User activates emergency code,"I work in the military as part of a tech support team. We don't do anything specific, we're simply in charge of all the technical stuff, from help desk to network management and installing hardware on the client side, mostly level 1 work. We have quite a lot of work. Thing is, end users don't realize how much work we really have, so they always assume our only job is to help desk them. Because of that we don't always have time to answer requests, and we ask them for a ticket while we work on more pressing matters. Users found a trick though - if they claim its urgent, we have to comply. It's just the rules. If you realize a user is bluffing on the phone and call them out, more often than not they will reach out to their superiors, who will talk to our superiors, who will force us to leave everything and help them out. Pretty fucking annoying. 

 This one time I was in night shift. During night shifts we usually go to sleep in a room that has an ip phone in it just in case of emergency. I answer a few calls throughout the night, nothing important really, and didn't realize I didn't hang up properly on the last time, which means calls couldn't get through. This fuck up is definitely on me. This one user tried to call me, but I wasn't available, so she contacted my superiors at 4am, screaming that she has an emergency - all of her computers malfunctioned. My superior tries to contact me, but my ip phone isn't picking up calls. End user keeps pressing on my superior to send a technician, and ends up activating emergency code, effectively waking up every single technician in the area at 4 fucking am just to get her problem solved. We're talking about 12 technicians on night duty. Most of them aren't even from my department so they don't know who I am, but they had to comply an emergency code. When they arrive at the scene, only 1 computer was affected, and she simply shut off explorer.exe by accident, which means she could simply restart the PC to fix the issue, but she didn't think this through. Hell fuck that, she could use another pc if she wanted to, but she couldn't grasp the idea of not using her regular pc that she has grown used to. 

When morning came I realized I fucked up and missed some calls. I return back to them, not knowing what happened, and I get accused of pulling off a massive prank. People reported of that incident to their superiors, which resulted in an interrogation. In the end, I was proven innocent but got scolded for missing the calls. I definitely fucked up, no question about it, but not as much as the end user. Apparently, she's new to the job, and was taught by her coworkers the ""special trick"" to get us to come, only she didn't know where to cross the line.",329,0,1
Travel Agent Likes Her Mailbox Broken,"Disclaimers: English is my native language, but without Grammarly, I'm hopeless. This happened in 2007 so some of the little details are hazy. I've long moved out of Technical Support, but I supported hardware and software for years before moving into software testing.  


I worked for a virtual server company between 2006 and 2010 and I really loved the job most nights. We had a variety of products for different levels of users. There was something for everyone. Our smallest servers could handle 3-5 email accounts and a basic HTML website. Putting Wordpress on these was not a great idea. And we had beefy VPS that supported robust websites with shopping carts and 100s of users. They also had an enterprise side but we didn't deal with those. Our Dovecot installations were mbox by default, but we could always convert them to maildir if needed and we frequently did. I'm never quite sure why they decided to do it the way they did, but the company had been in business since the late 90s and was owned by a Japanese company by the time I got there.  


Anyway, I worked the midnight shift so I rarely got calls from US-based users that didn't know what they were doing. My customers were mostly Asian resellers and web developers.  One night, I got a call from a woman who ran a travel agency. She was irate that her email stopped working. Her mail client isn't accessing her mail anymore. Even webmail is choking. After double-checking her settings, I go into her directory and see a 1GB mbox file. I wasn't even sure how it had managed to work at all at that size.  I then politely explain that her mailbox file has gotten too large and that I had a couple of options. I could break apart the file into smaller parts and put the oldest emails up for her to backup if needed later. I could then convert the last two years of emails to maildir, thus restoring her email and preventing this from happening again. And I could show her how to configure her Outlook to use IMAP instead of POP.  (There was no way I could do the whole 1GB file, because there were so many emails that the mail system would choke on them all.)  


Oh boy, you'd swear that I suggested sacrificing a fluffy kitten on a high holiday. She didn't want to lose any emails for record-keeping. I explained that she wasn't going to lose them. She could download the file(s) and I could get her back up and running, but that it wasn't possible to just convert the whole file. She obviously knew nothing about computers outside of Microsoft Office and just wasn't hearing it. She was screaming, swearing, calling me stupid. I kept cool and tried desperately to give her workable options to get her up and running. Nope. She didn't want to me to touch her emails. Even when I find out 95% of them are just spam and she refused to delete them. I've never known someone more who wanted a magic wand and didn't want to get at least functioning while other options could be explored by higher-level techs. She ended up cussing me out one last time and hanging up. As there were only six of us on the shift, we all sat together, and calls were light, my coworkers heard the exchanged and for the next hour she got the same canned responses from my coworkers. She even asked for the supervisor and the only Tech II we had. When the day shift came in, we warned the supervisors about what had happened. I have no idea what eventually happened, I'd like to believe she returned to snail mail.",211,0,1
Worked for a Streaming Company,"EDIT: Sorry for my bad spelling. English is not my native language.  
Just to be 100%,  I wont give you any names.

I work now for about 3 years in Customer Service. In this time, i worked for 3 Month as a Tech Support Agent for a huge streaming company.It was this classic "" did you try turning it off and on again "" typ of job. So yea, it was pretty easy.... But the customers.... oof.

I have so many storys from my time as customer service agent.  But this one especially gave me the biggest oof effect.

One day, a lady called claiming she has log in issuesShe used a smarttv and i thought she probably just had a  typo ( which is pretty common if using a remote )So I asked her:Me: ""Can you tell me what kind of message pops if you enter your login details ? ""Her: "" Yes, E-Mail is already taken ""I realized she must have clicked on register instead of log in ( fun fact: this too happens alot, mostly with older people )Me: "" Ok I see, you must have clicked on the wrong button, just go a few steps back to see the main menu again ""In order to help the customer as good as possible, we had guides of each possible device. So I knew she had to go like 3 steps backMe: "" Go back ""Her: "" yes ""Me: ""Again one step""Her ""ok""Me"" And go back again""Her:"" i cant""Me: "" why ? did you receive somekind of error message ? ""Her: "" no, but i am already at wall of my room, I cant go further ""It took me about 30 seconds to realize that she literally moved back from the tv.

Thank god this is over. Dont get me wrong, the job WAS pretty easy but I had calls like this on a daily basis. 45 mins calls explaining an old lady how to reset her passwort or explaining a guy why he cant get a refund for a missing day after he locked his account.

"User forgot to log off after she went into the homeoffice mode because ""that's what the others told me""","This is a fresh one.

So, this user called our service desk. Four times today, I was the fifth one. Basically, the Outlook was prompting the password, the user typed it in but it didn't go further. I looked through the today's tickets to see what my colleagues did. One of them reset the password because it expired. And from then, the problems with Outlook happened. The reason for this was a locked GROUP\ account in all of the tickets before. So I unlocked it and asked the user to try again. Ten minutes later, the GROUP\ account got locked again – by itself.

Strange I thought. So I asked our second level if they have some time and if they could check what's happening with the automatic lockouts. A few minutes later, I got an answer with the screenshot that there were several lockouts today and for all of them, the reason was another computer. I looked that computer up and it was a desktop PC belonging to the user.

So I asked the user for more info. They told me they work from home (and 95 % of the users work on Citrix remote desktops). Aaaand just to confirm what our 2nd level told me, I asked if the user was logged before. They told me that when they left work to go into the homeoffice mode, they just (I cite word by word) ""lock the screen because that's what the others told me"". There. Just there, I facepalmed really hard. Of course, the office desktop was logged under the old password which was continously blocking the GROUP\ account after the today's pwd change. I promptly advised her to go into the office and log off.

I think I'm gonna go crazy with this company where someone tells the users to ""lock the screen"" instead of a proper logout or shutdown. My hair is already starting to get gray.",430,0,1
Can you turn our smart boards into a 20 foot monitor?,"A fun one from about 9-10 years ago. The business I worked for not only did office equipment repair we also offered a variety of tech solutions. One of the tech solutions I loved was Sharp brand interactive smart boards, aka a huge ass touch pad TV/monitor. We sold a couple of these to schools and various businesses, one such business was an investment broker who had a nice mid-large sized office that included two conference rooms and a training room. They ended up getting three 80 inch smart boards, one for each of the conference rooms and one for the training room, and a nice surround sound system with wireless mics for the training room.

The owner’s son (Who I’ll refer to as J) was their resident tech for basic computer stuff and also worked on the investment end of things. Over the course of setting everything up and testing/instructing on the new “toys” he and I got to talking about tech, gaming, etc. and we end up talking about how cool it would be to use the displays for gaming. I mentioned that they could get upgrade kits for the displays that would make them mobile stand-alone stations that didn’t need a dedicated desktop hooked up and would allow them to put all of them in the conference room if they needed more than one screen and could be set as clone displays.

I could see the wheels turning in his head and he said he’d talk to his dad about getting the upgrades. Cut to two days later and my boss is asking me to order the upgrade kits for all the displays. These kits included hydraulic legs on nice wheels so you could adjust the height and move the system with ease. It also had a dedicated PC mounted to the stand to run the touch displays. After about two weeks I went over and setup the new kits and showed the added functions. After going over everything and his father had left the room J questioned me about auxiliary input on the displays and how to setup multiple displays using a single system, I explain how to do it if his video card supports multiple displays. J then shows me a freshly built gaming rig he had in his office, I’m sure you all know where this is going, that had a very nice video card for the time with multiple displays outputs. I show him how to set it up after hooking everything up and give him my cell number in case he has questions for his after hour’s hobby.

Two weeks later I get a call on Friday night from J saying he’s running the multiple displays but can’t get the resolutions to look right across all three screens, two look ok but the third throws everything off. I’m intrigued and also very curious to see this monster setup so I drive over, only a thirty minute drive, and take a look at everything. I have to say three 80” displays side by side hooked up to a gaming rig looks AWESOME. After some tinkering in the settings and playing with the available resolutions I come to the conclusion that due to the sheer size of everything that we’d have to use a wide screen resolution that didn’t quite go corner to corner but still maintained a proper ratio for display. J is a little bummed and asks if there is anything I can think of because he wants to game on all 3 displays on the weekends and also wanted run cable through the setup to watch football. I told him I’d do some research and get back to him.

I poured over a ton of different video controllers and display setup information, I was a man on a mission I wanted this to work so much my inner geek was having a meltdown. After hunting all weekend I finally came across a series of controllers made by Sharp that is designed to be used for wall display setups ranging from 2 up to 24 screens. It could be set to auto adjust the output depending on what resolution you wanted and how many displays you want to use. I gave J a call and told him I found a solution but it was a bit expensive, He said he’d talk to his dad and see about getting him to foot the bill so they could watch football on the setup, his dad was a huge college football fan and J was using that as a selling point to get him to sign off on it.

The next day we got a go ahead to get the controller and get it set up. After it came in I went over and installed it in the training room with J chomping at the bit to try it out. His dad also poked his head in once or twice to see if we had it running yet, pretty sure he was just as excited as J but was trying not to act like a little kid at Christmas. After some tinkering I had it set and it looked good on the PC, then we connected to cable box. Had to do some tweaks again but got it looking real good. Almost a complete fill across the displays and it looked amazing. Being the geek I am I also brought the necessary connectors to hook up the audio to the surround sound system in the room. We did a quick test at low volume and then looked up a touchdown run on the YouTube and proceeded to crank to volume almost to max, it sounded like a stadium. His dad jumps in the room with a huge grin on his face and proceeds to stand in awe of the glorious triple wide display running football footage and hearing it through the surround sound system (he didn’t know I planned on hooking it up to do that), after the clip he proceeds to *yell* at us to turn it down all the while still grinning ear to ear.

In total for all the displays, hardware, setup, and extras it cost roughly $12k for a very nice business system that doubled as a killer entertainment system. They definitely got their money’s worth as J sent me a few photos of them on the weekends after hours with their big comfy office chairs in the training room with the table’s setup with a tailgate buffet and coolers as foot rests. He also sent me a couple shots of him gaming, a couple racing games (which looked insane) and some shots of him playing WoW.

Actually glad I did all the research for this since I ended up doing a similar setup for an emergency response training facility that had 4 of these units. No football or gaming that time but used for training purposes.",520,0,1
The same old customers,"Way back 2013 or 2014 I used to work  as a customer support rep for roku(this was just the start of the internet tv box) before android TVs and such, I had a lot of customers call in and be d×cks from the get go but most were senior citizens who did'nt even know they needed a password to connect to their wifi so you had to walk them through getting the password and typing it on the screen

"So, I took out our 802.1x authentication servers by mistake","PSA: double and triple and quadruple check your code. Scratch that, just copy paste lines that work and edit info to create new lines!

I don't post much, but I figured you guys would appreciate this.  I am a sysadmin for a medium sized manufacturing company.  We are a 3 person IT team, so we try to automate as much as possible.  One of the automations we use is Puppet for server configuration.

Anyway, we have 802.1x set up so only computers with domain accounts can get an IP address.  One of the ways to bypass that to allow networked printers is to use a Mac Address Bypass configuration file with Puppet to push devices we want to allow to the Radius server.  We rarely get new network printers since most of our multi-function copiers are leased.

Last week we got a new copier in and I forgot the tech was coming to install and remove the old one.  I am hurriedly trying to get the new copier authenticated in DHCP because the old one was already removed and an entire department was down.  I had my laptop in the room with the copier when I realized DUH, I hadn't added the MAC to the mac address bypass configuration.  Normally when I do this I copy the last line, paste it into notepad, change the MAC info, then copy and paste back into the Puppet config file.  This time I decided to write a new line manually because I hate copy and paste using a touchpad.  

So here I am, just created the new MAC entry in the bypass list, and am twiddling my thumbs and swearing because the printer still will not get a valid IP and is continually sitting there with a private IP.  I think to myself, OK, it is a new copier and maybe there is a setting inside that needs to be changed.  As the tech and I are poking around in the printer, my phone starts buzzing.  Someone can't log into a conference room PC.  That's fine, they usually can't remember a password or use the wrong syntax the first time they enter a username.  I leave and go check it out.  The computer will not authenticate on the network.  Well crap, looks like it lost it's authentication settings from GP.  I take it back to my test bench to re-sync the GP and re-add it to the 802.1x authentication group.  Take it back, and same issue.  OK, let's try another conference room PC, maybe this one is just having a case of the Mondays (on Thursday LOL).  Same issue with the other PC.

Then my phone starts buzzing repeatedly with people not able to log into their computers or access the network if they do.  Poke around in syslog, well crap.  802.1x authentication is failing across the board.  At this point network connection is completely gone for around 2/3 of the company.  Something seems to have hosed our primary RADIUS server.  Oh look, the fail-over has errors out the wazoo too. As well as the third and final auth server.  

WTF.  Maybe the patches last week?  Maybe it didn't reboot cleanly and just decided to quit?

No.  Finally something clicks and I decide to check the MAC address bypass config again.  Everything seems to be fine, the format is all the same until.... BOOM.  I see it.  A semi-colon where a colon should be.  In the single line of code I added.  That can't possibly be the cause, can it?  It is one line of code in a MAC address bypass config.  That can't possibly affect all of our RADIUS servers.  

WRONG.  It did.  And when Puppet pushed the new config to the RADIUS servers, they went down and stopped authenticating one by one.  A silly semi-colon just staring me in the face and giving me the finger.  Needless to say I promptly ended it's existence and replaced the bugger with a glorious colon, pushed the config to Puppet, and all the RADIUS servers were once again happy and authenticating as they should.  


Probably one of the most embarrassing mistakes in my 10+ years IT professional career.

DotNet shenanigans,"Background: this was a huge worldwide company, industry leader in the field, and it was basically 100% dependent on IT.

There was upon a time, fairly recent, a top company that had 10! CTOs in the span of 4 years. (None got fired).

And this marvelous company, fully dependent on IT specialists and programmers decided to outsource everything and not even keep a skeleton crew on board.

This is where my dumbass comes in. Some middle management smart guys got together and decided that they actually need and IT department, so they hired specialists and programmers under different departments. This should've been a red flag but I took it as an opportunity.

Now back to our story: there was an old ancient cluster of servers dating back to when humanity first discovered binary. It was unmaintained for well over a year. Why you ask? Because all outsourcing was done for desktops and laptops, not one clause specified servers.

So this ancient beast served well over 1000 people and secured their livelihood. 
I take a look into the abyss, and boy do I get a chill on my back. I ask:

""Erm, is there a replacement and migration plan and a new cluster on the way?

""Of course not, why would there be one?

""Was there a replacement plan before the it apocalypse?""

""Well yea, but it was too expensive and it got shelved, we bought all these new laptops instead""

Okay, my alarm starts going off, I need to save that poor cluster before it dies.

6 horrific months later, the replacement is approved and finally we can move up from server 2003(Tm).

The outsorced company receive instructions to take care of the new cluster, and we have to work in tandem for a veeery fast migration.

The first and most important in the order of business is to migrate the main database and push it on live, along with about 10 of the 300 clients.

I make my case, strongly, very strongly: ""migrate smaller clients in the first batch, in case of problems when can quickly fallback and save everything"".

You can guess what management decided: migrate the largest, most important clients first. 

""Oh boy, can we at least do them on our terms?""

""No, the outsorcing company will take care of them""

Needless to say, it was such a clusterfuck that not even one of the clients was migrated successfully.

Anyway, we passed that moment, the server was live for 2 weeks, some 50 clients now enjoyed it, about 40% of the load, and the rest would follow soon. Hell, even some new and important clients were on it.

When the new cluster was approved there was a very important document drafted by some IT guru, and it said that the main database server should be configured such as the database could not be stopped by anything else than human input. This meant that any command to the server that stops the server will be ignored, be it a windows update, software installation, software update, etc. So that they would never influence the uptime.

The only way to stop the server was to first stop the database service.

A second file contained details and policies on how, and especially when such operations could be performed.

So here is me, Monday morning, chilling, when I get informed that the server is down.
Console is outsorced, so I try to rdp in: the server is up but I get disconnected, I try again, and again, and again, until an error pops up stating that the rdp service is not responding.

I take all the info from that error and start a frenzy trying to find out a cause.
Everything points out to a .NET framework update.

Basically the server is telling everyone and everything that it wants a restart.

I hurry along and get this info to the company that does the outsorcing, I inform everyone that the server is stuck on a .net issue and needs a hard restart.

Turns out that the outsorcing company decided to perform a .net update with the database running, because they weren't allowed to stop it. This caused every other service on the server to stop, except for the one that it could not stop.

It took 6 more hours to get the other company to restart the server.

Edit: the update should've been planned by them and approved by us. They should've also respected the steps agreed in the procedure, but they just ignored everything and pushed the update.",235,0,1
Wholesome story ( During covid season),"So I am new to tech support and I don't have many stories, but this one just happened a few minutes ago. I got a call from a teacher there is an outage on his beam for the internet. He sounded so sad for one moment like so devastated that he can't teach his kids today. Then a moment of silence, the I hear in a whisper ""yes yes yes"" I ask if everything is okay. This guy goes on a whole rant,

""So don't get me wrong I love my kids and I love teaching. However, we had a test today that I know nobody is ready for. I am not even ready for it, teaching over the web is hard and so many of my kids need one on one and hand to had help. I have already sent out a mass text before I called about the internet to the \[parents that my internet was not working and class might be cancelled today, and to the ones that need extra help I messaged their parents saying help them here is some things that can help you and told them about some links to videos. I don't want my kids to fail i am so happy that there is an outage going on and that i can give them more time to actually learn.""

Guys when i tell you that i laughed so hard i felt so bad. I told him

""im sorry but you are a teacher that cares about your students and i never had that and they way that you WISHED for your internet to stop working to give them more time just warmed my heart.""

He thanked me and asked when it would be fixed, they have not given us an estimated time for fixing it. He said

""That is completely okay with me... maybe not the other thousands of customers that don't have internet but i am totally okay with this, do you know how long it normally takes to fix this kind of issue?""

I let him know that I was somewhat new and am still getting the hang on how long these can can generally take. I gave him my best guess and told him it could be longer or shorter they have only given us so much information. He was okay with it and wished me a lovely day and that he was and i quote (even though i have been \[pretty much quoting this whole conversation because it literally just happened about 2 minutes ago)

""i am going to spend time with my wife for once during the week and have a lovely picnic and enjoy my day. Hopefully people are not mean when they call you because you are a delight to talk with""

I thanked him back and he ended the call i had to go on break to stop laughing and it just warmed my heart. Every other call i've had this morning about the outage has been unbelievably annoying and people are extremely mad because school and work and all that fun stuff covid has blessed us with but that guy has made my day for the rest of the day. I hope he never has to call back about his internet again and just has the best life because he was a ray of sunshine in a cloudy world.

I don't understand. It was running fine and then I happened.,"I work in a very specific industry so I will remain vague about a lot of product details.  80% of the work is troubleshooting over the phone with our dealers located all over the country.  The other 20% is showing up in person to an emergency where we explain the chain of command to the inanimate machine refusing to work.  That is we get a chain and beat the machine with it until the it understands who is in command and starts working again.

My coworkers were some of the most excellent people I have ever had the pleasure of working with.  There was the old timer whose employee number was a single digit and had likely broken more things over the course of his career than I will ever fix.  There was Deadpool, a semi chaotic super genius who engineering wouldn't let look at the source code because he might get ideas.  There was the boss man who inspired confidence in everyone because he did the same work as us and had been around long enough to have a double digit employee number.  There was Captain America who looked exactly like Steve Rodgers and could have been a male model if he could stomach dealing with useless people.  Instead he worked with us and used a mix of mind reading and Fonzie style juke box banging to resurrect every machine from the dead.  Lastly there was the guy from El Salvador who spoke excellent english, but had a bad ear for accents so I would have to sometimes translate southern english to regular english for him.  We'll call him the Swede.  Since I want a cool name too, I'll call myself. . . Myself.  

So no shit, there I was 2 weeks after getting hired, trying to figure out if I'm holding one of the the manuals upside down or maybe sideways when the old timer comes over to my desk.  

Old Timer:  The neighbor called and can't get his machine to run.  He wants one of us to sneak away from the phone and fix it for him.  Why don't you take the intern over there and show him how to remote start it and check the error codes.  Take my truck.  Tools are in the back.  

Boss Man:  Don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  

Deadpool:  One of us will come collect your bodies in about half an hour.

The intern and I drive half a mile to meet the neighbor and get some details on why the machine won't run.  

Neighbor:  I don't understand what happened.  It was running fine this morning and now the motors won't move more than a few inches.  I don't know if we fried a sensor or maybe lost VFD communication.  He keeps coming back to how it worked earlier and he can't understand what went wrong.

He couldn't think of any more important information (this is important for later), so I proceeded to show the intern how to start the machine remotely without incurring maiming, injury, explosions or anything else fun.  There were no error codes but the tension compression switch had killed the machine.  I grabbed a wrench and showed him how to manually let the tension off.  Then we started the maching again.  The motors revved up and got faster and faster before there was a loud unsettling CLANG and it shut down in tension again.  

Since it only made scary noises and nothing actually broke, we decided to do this 3 or 4 more times to see if we could learn anything new.  And we did.  The controls and sensors were all working perfectly.  Unfortunately sensors are only as good as the inputs they are given and we noticed two motors that would always spin the opposite direction from the others.  The sensors would see tension build and have the VFD increase the frequency of the offending motors to make them catch up to the others.  Unfortunately this just makes the problem worse when the motor isn't even spinning the right way.  

I gave the intern a quick lesson on changing direction for 3-phase motors which involves swapping some wires.  We hit the go button and waited for the start up sequence to reach the spinning motor section.  While we were waiting, Captain America arrived to see if we were still alive and or collect whatever remained if we somehow came into contact with 480 volts worth of angry pixies.  The machine started running like a dream.  Captain america went on his way and I went over to talk to the neighbor.  

Myself:  We fixed it but I don't understand how it was even working earlier.  We had to actually move some wires to get all the motors spinning the same direction.  

Neighbor:  When I said it was running earlier, I meant before we took it apart, replaced the spindles, and wired the motors back up to it.  

Myself:  OK.  Bye.  (Screamimg internally)  

Back at the office I told my story to the team and they didn't seem surprised at all.  

Old Timer:  Yea that neighbor has created an art form of telling you everything under the sun except for the one relevant piece of information.",1229,0,1
School district saves a couple $ and almost costs me my sanity.,"This story involves the same school district I mentioned in a previous post. Amazingly enough it wasn’t the elementary school who had issues this day, no this time it was the high school’s turn to challenge my sanity and patience.

We got a call saying that the main copier in the high school was having intermittent jamming issues. Lucky me! Being the only tech available I get on the road to see what issue was causing headaches for my favorite group of ladies at the high school. I get on site and take a look at the reports, nothing to major just random jams out of tray one. I pop out the feed unit and replace the rollers, slap it back in the machine, fire some test copies through the machine, write up my paperwork and call it a day. Cut to the next day and again, high school is having jam issues… what the hell???

On site again and again the machine report lists random jams out of tray 1…

*Ok machine, time to fix you for good.*

I swap feed units with another tray and run some test, no jams in tray 1. Ok now let’s check the unit I swapped and… no jams… o.O? Ok, maybe it’s a timing clutch being prissy, so I change the clutch on the original feed unit and put it back in tray 1, again run test prints through the machine, write up my paperwork and head out. Cut to the next day and AGAIN the high school is having jam issues.

*Ok machine… NOW it’s personal -.-*

I grab drive motors, complete feed units, a variety of feed timing clutches for the various sections, sensors, and drive belts for the multiple sections that have them all from a machine in the shop that I know works fine (it’s one I had refurbished for resale and we had been using it for months as our spare printer).

When in doubt *SHOTGUN* the problem, aka replace everything you can think of related to the issue at hand and then figure it out later in the shop. Again I get on site swap out all the parts I had brought with me. I asked the office ladies for anything and everything I could get my hands on to run test prints/copies I ran over 10 reams of paper (5000+ sheets of paper) through that machine and not a jam. *Finally VICTORY!!!!* Write up my paperwork specifically noting the amount of testing I had done and called it a day.

That’s the end, no more issues were had and I could stop worrying about that account for a while is what I REALLY want to tell you dear readers but alas…. NO I cannot say that.

The next day AGAIN they call in and say it’s having jams.

*NO!!! HEAD DESK! HEAD DESK! HEAD DESK! While quietly sobbing internally. Why tech gods, why have you forsaken me???*

My boss is not happy, this is day 4 of the same issue and the third recall for the same thing. I get on the phone and tell the ladies at the school to not touch the machine, leave it as it is, TOUCH NOTHING!!! At this point I am stumped, the ONLY thing I haven’t replaced is the tray itself. So I pulled the tray our of our office machine, grabbed my tools and what remained of my sanity and headed to the school figuring I’d be on hold with dealer support trying to figure this out for the next couple of hours.

I get on site, pull out tray one, toss it on the table, and slap the other tray in place. I fill it full of paper and again ask for anything I could make copies/prints of. Again no jams… I’m at a total loss there’s no way it was the tray causing the issues, I had used said tray the three days prior and ran a case of paper out of it What the hell is going on here?!?! Feeling utterly hopeless I take a 5 minute break and just put my head down on the desk looking at the tray sitting beside me.

I need to note that tray 1 on this particular model of machine was a large capacity tray, designed to hold 3 reams of paper at a time to help cut down on the need to refill the tray all the time.

*The layout of the paper in tray 1 is what's know as Letter where its sitting 11"" top to bottom and 8 1/2"" side to side. There's another layout know as Letter R(Letter Rotate) where the paper is in the machine 8 1/2"" top to bottom and 11"" side to side this is important later*

*blink blink* What the hell???

Looking at the paper sitting in the tray from the side… What the HELL???

I immediately take a VERY close look at the paper I left in the tray, there was about a ream of slightly poorer quality paper sitting on top of the normal nice bright white paper that I was getting from the cases of paper in the office. This duller paper also has a very small repeating gap along both edges of the stack (side to side the 8 1/2"" side) if you look at it from the side. Top to bottom on the 11"" side there was no such gaps. I rifle down through the paper and discover that about every 15 sheets there is one sheet that is about a cm shorter than the others. I pull the paper and ask the ladies in the office where this paper came from. 


M: our just short of clinically insane technician
S: Secretary
P: Dic... I mean the principal of the school and board member.


S: Oh that’s the teachers stock, they use paper out of that closet. *pointing to a closed closet behind them* 


M: Teacher’s stock???


S: Yeah, the Principal got a good deal on cheaper paper for the teachers to use for classes. We use the stuff stacked by the copier for everything else in administration.


M: May I?


S: Sure


I pull out a fresh ream of the teacher’s paper, take off the outer wrapper and proceed to look down the outer edges of the ream and sure enough the exact same repeating gaps along the edges. AHH HA!!! I proceed to fan through the paper and pull out the ONE short sheet every fifteen or so pages, stick it in the copier and no jams for an entire ream. I then put a “fresh” ream of teachers stock in the machine and start getting jams as soon as the copier runs a couple of the shorter sheets. FINALLY!!! *angelic voices sounding victory in my head*

I asked the secretary if the jams only occurred when teachers were making copies.


S: Now that you mention it I think so.


M: Why is this the first time I've seen this paper?


S: Oh, we knew you'd run test like always with our stuff so we took it out and put it away.


*Eye twitching* M: That's so thoughtful, I'm guessing you left it in today because I said dont touch anything?


S: Yeah, ""insert secretary 2's name"" was going to take it out but I told her you said dont touch anything.


I honestly did the following: I walked over, calmly clasped her hand in both of mine, looked her dead in the eyes *cue romantic background music* and in a soft voice I said ""Thank You!""


S: *taken a bit back by my reaction* Um, what?


I proceed to show her that the cheaper paper had occasionally shorter sheets in the stacks and explained that that tiny bit of difference in length was causing timing issues and said If secretary 2 had taken the paper out I may not have found the issue at all.

At this point the principal had come out and started huffing and puffing about how this is unacceptable and we're never using your company again even if we're the lowest bidders on the service contract. These machines are junk we're always having problems, etc.


M: Sir, I finally have the issue resolved. I know exactly what has been causing the problems. Turns out it was the cheaper paper the teachers were using.


P: Oh that's a load, there's nothing wrong with that paper. I got it at a discount from our supplier.


M: There's a reason it was probably discounted.


I proceed to show him the sheets that are cut shorter than the rest of the stack and explain that even though minor it's enough to cause timing issues in a machine running at high speeds.


P: *Scoff* Theres now way that's causing the issue!


M: Ok! I can prove it. I'll take a ream of the cheap stuff, pull out all the short sheets and run the entire thing with no jams. Then I'll try one as is and it won't get 50 sheets without a jam.


At this point this was either going to work or I was going to say F it and let my boss deal with this guy. I was done dealing with this nightmare, especially since I finally had it figured out and knew exactly what the issue was.

Folks, you'll never guess what happened. It did exactly what I said. Fixed ream has zero issues, the ""as is"" ream was jam central. *Shocker*


P: So you're saying we have several pallets of paper we can't use in the machines without having to manually go through and remove the short paper. How am I going to explain that to everyone? No! I need this to work no matter what.


Pretty sure he didn't want to tell his teachers they'd have to waste time pulling paper or explain to the board why said teachers were wasting time pulling paper.


M: its actually not that big of an issue. You'll just have tell the teachers to only use tray 2 for their paper.


Tray 2 on the machine was setup as Letter R, as mentioned above. Because the paper was short on the 8 1/2"" side running it out of tray 2 would mean the unaltered 11"" edge would be used for timing and would cause no issues. If you were copying/printing to the very edge it would cut off a bit but for their purposes it worked perfectly fine.

My solution was simply keep tray 2 stocked with only the teachers paper and when the teachers needed to make copies simply pull tray 1 out about an inch to force the copier to use tray 2, being a digital copier it would automatically rotate the image and do its job normally.


P: Really? That's all we have to do?

M: Yes.


I then explained what I typed above and that it would work with no issues as long as they only use the paper in the Letter R trays.


P: Well ok, you're sure it will work fine.


*REALLY DUDE!* 


M: Absolutely! Here I'll run an entire ream from tray 2 and it won't jam.


Proceed to do the above without a jam. *BOOM Mic drop bitch! Honestly if it had jammed I would have just packed up and said I quit! send someone else to deal with this shit.*


P: Ok then, this will work.


M: *No shit Sherlock internal monologue * Yes, now you may still have the occasional jam if the feed rollers wear out but they last for about 150k sheets so you shouldn't see me for a while.


*Yes in hindsight I should of just shut up and left, but my scrambled brain was in CYA mode*


P: I'll hold you too that! Laughing


*Shit*


M: Do you mind if I take some of the paper with me to show my boss, since this was such an odd problem?  *again CYA mode*


P: Sure, just make sure you comp me the prints.


*you cheap ass.....*


M: I'll let the boss know that's what you want.


I FINALLY make it out of there and get back to the shop. I then proceeded to explain what the hell happened to my boss and do a quick show and tell.


M: the tech guy who's sanity at this point is barley being held together by chewing gum.
B: Boss


B: Well that's a new one for the books.


M: Yeah... Oh by the way the principal wanted comped for the paper on his contract bill.


B: Sure thing, with all the test prints you made figuring this out it covers the cost. It was all stuff they needed and kept right?


M: Absolutely, you know I hate wasting paper doing tests so I ran nothing but stuff they'd keep/use.


I need to note that service contracts were set on a cost per copy basis where you had so many copies a month and me running  all those prints put them over their monthly limit so they'd be getting an extra charge that month. If we ran garbage prints we had to keep track to deduct it from customers totals. I was notorious for only doing about 25 junk prints when testing a machines and always asking for things customers needed prints copies of.

May my fellow techs have a great, calm, stress free day. Sadly if you're working, especially with remote users, that's probably not going to happen.",2057,0,1
New monitor deployment and the ensuing fights over empty boxes,"I actually enjoy this story, its pretty wholesome compared to the other shenanigans you read about on this sub.

I am in the middle of deploying 70+ new monitors for exsisting desktops and recycling (taking out back and recreating 'Office Space') the old 4:3 that somehow we were still using.

These monitors are coming in, what I have been told, are very nice boxes that are very useful for storing crafts or other items. Most of the women that work in this office are older (think very nice grandmothers) and they have been ""fighting"" over the empty boxes as they want to take them all home. Since we have so many of them, there is plenty to go around.

We have finally come to an agreement that there will be a rotation on who gets the next boxes (I am the only one doing the deployment so it takes some time between this and my other daily duties) and they are all lined up to get as many as they can take.

At least it makes it easier for me, I dont have to break them down and haul them out to the recycling dumpster lol",307,0,1
Videowall cost cuts,"This is a continuation of my previous posts, especially ""check where you pay for your software"".

This post will address some questions from the comments and hopefully leave you more bewildered.

One sunny day in hell some spawn of Satan decided that people should be able to see a TV screen from space. Thus the videowall was born. There are many variations on the concept but it's basically a huge TV screen.
Now the most modern take on it in the mid 2010s were fullhd plasmas 3-6-9-12, the sky is the limit, all connected to a proprietary device.(a very expensive one)

Now techs were, at that time, obsessed over a cute little kitten called raspberry. And they had so many dreams and plans with it that they considered it a solution to every problem. Someone even made a server with those puppies.

Anyway, in our story, some smart guy decided that a videowall could work very well with an rpi and some basic splitters. This basically cut the proprietary device out and cut the cost tenfold. Good job.

Now back to our little story. We had a few of these things at first, and apparently clients loved them, they loved them so much in fact that we had to install as many as we could.

Now installation is simple and straightforward, configuration is complicated but straightforward. And at about no. 10 in, we found out that the first ones were failing.

A bug? Not really, everything worked as intended, except once we left one running, it was at the mercy of power outages. And the power outages had a very bad habit of resetting the signal source. So after a while they would all turn to a black screen.

A fix was already in place, we left remote controls so they could all be set to the proper source. Yet nobody was able to do so, for some reason.

Well, you see, professional screens have two identical hdmi inputs + an extra display port and newer models even had built in videowall feature using display port output and input ports.

And so the story of fixing the videowalls begins: 
first order of business, go to all videowalls and place the hdmi on input no. 1. 10.000 km and an oil change later -done

Now they should be fixed, right? Technically yea, you would use a remote and set the input to hdmi 1. Voilla. Except, randomly, and without proper cause, one, two ore even 3 TV's would not respond, and you got a videowall working with a missing piece.
This was so bad that we went to order of business number 2: discover the issue. 100 phonecalls later, another 10.000 km and an oil change - done.

Every videowall had one IR receiver and the signal was then passed to unscreened cheap jack-jack cables. (You know, the cheapest ones possible).

So our trusty supplier recommends a 10 dollar cable. It has gold plating, double sleeve, noise damping layer.
Oh, did I mention the noise? Some contractors installed 9 HDMI cables running too close to one of the power lines. Not even one was usable. And they didn't even have a noise screen.

Anyway. The problem is solved. I get this to every manager. ""All 25 cent cables have to be replaced with 10 dollar cables and your videowalls will run forever).

I got reprimanded for attempting to make unjustifiable extra costs.
I did get one videowall running with expensive cables, and rumor has it that it still runs today.
As for the rest, they were decommissioned 1 year later because they required one full time employee with a company car, constantly setting the videowalls.",194,0,1
"""The Printer is Still Broken""","The business I work for is currently moving over from a Windows environment to a ChromeOS one. Sadly, our old printer system (soon to be brutally killed) doesn't play particularly well with Chromebooks, so do not show on the list of available printers when attempting to print.

Budget? Why would you need a budget?,"Long, long ago, in a land about thirty miles south of here, I got hired as tech support for three states’ offices of a huge nonprofit. They hadn’t had a tech guy in most of a year, and either they loved me or they were desperate. I’m sure it was love.

My boss was an accountant. She told me on my first day that THE priority was getting laptops to all the field staff. Most of them were using pencil and paper, since their crop of aging Dells had been unsupported for almost a year of hard use.

I looked over the list of hardware, and immediately determined that most of it wasn’t worth keeping even if it had worked. We’re talking seriously obsolete laptops that had been getting abused long past their projected lifespans. So I asked, what is my budget?

I figured that if I had a decent budget, I would buy about a pallet of laptops, and spend a few weeks imaging and shipping. If I had a small budget, I’d buy a few and fix the rest. Tiny budget, fix them all.

She looked slightly uncomfortable.

”Well, there is no budget.”

I knew, just KNEW, that this did not mean spend all the dollars, but I asked anyway. “So, like, cost is no object?”

No.

The entire IT budget had just been sitting around not getting spent for that year. And they had needed to put a new roof on the office where my boss worked. My IT budget was keeping rain off my boss’ head, but not keeping pencils out of the field staff’s hands.

She repeated that my priority was getting the laptops (which were helpfully stacked in the basement, by the oil tank) fixed. With no money, zero dollars, not one penny for parts.

There turned out to be around fifty laptops there, of three generations. I managed to cannibalize enough parts to fix about a third of them, which made my boss 33% happy and gave me a 33% chance of continued employment.

I was considering how to most effectively beg my boss for a budget, when the National IT convention for the organization started. We got flown to Texas, and I got to see just how far down the prosperity ladder our three-state group was. We weren’t quite dead last, but we were definitely the po folks in the group. The bigger states were complaining about how much they had to pay to GET RID OF the Models of laptop I was fixing!

A light went off for me, and I generously offered to securely dispose of those laptops for two of the wealthiest states.

Over the next month, I received about 160 laptops, mostly even working! My field staff loved me. Some of them, the newer hires, had never had a company laptop before.

My boss, far from approving of my meeting an impossible goal, yelled at me because all the other accountants sneered at her. My stunt reminded them all of how poor we were.

Ya just can’t make some people happy.

"SharePoint is Broken, or; Issues Arising in High Turnover Development Teams","So, I've wanted to write this story out for a while. As a disclaimer, I'm not really a technical person - I had the fortune/misfortune of being the youngest person in the office and inherited a lot of technical type things from a man with many more skills than me. 

The company I worked for was a Big IT Company (but of the type that nobody has ever heard of), multimillion in profit, billions in revenue, purely B2B. I worked in an offshoot of the Sales teams, in the Bid Team. We wrote tender responses, worked with wonderful technical people (and others who had titles like Solution Architect but couldn't use a printer).

Because most of our work was collaborative, it was decided to invest in a custom built instance of Sharepoint that would best suit our needs. As luck would have it, we had a team in the Professional Services department who specialised in SharePoint, and they built a beautiful looking instance for us. We could click a few buttons, and SharePoint sites would automatically build, according to a set template, and people from across the business could easily collaborate with us. 

Time went on, and the SharePoint team slowly left, and were replaced, as happens in large workplaces where people feel unappreciated. A new manager for the team came in, and wondered why they were supporting tickets for our problems when their role was deemed to be consultative. It was decided that support would be handed over to our Eastern European Service Desk. 

Problem number one appeared when we called SD for a small problem - nobody had told them that they were now supporting this. Easily resolved, with our strong connections to Senior Management, it got pushed through the correct channels at speed. 

Problem number two occurred the next time we called SD for a small problem - the SharePoint team hadn't passed over any documentation. This led into problem number three - the SharePoint team had never WRITTEN any documentation, despite selling this custom instance on to a number of customers. 

With the SharePoint team having limited resources, a very technical man in our team took it upon himself to document how the system was set up. All of the settings, all of the bits and pieces we saw, common errors and their fixes (that we had come across over the years), etc. And, for the remainder of the 18 months he worked there, it was enough. I really wish I hadn't accepted the small raise to take on a number of his responsibilities, however. 

Until one miserable raining Monday morning in November (in the UK, most Monday mornings are miserable and rainy), we came into work, and tried to hit the magic button that built us a site. And it failed. We tested it with different users, at different sites, in different browsers. Nothing, no dice. So we called the Service Desk, who called the SharePoint team, who all sat very puzzled. 

The only piece of the puzzle the very technical man hadn't managed to solve, was the Site Builder module, which sat in Azure. The password had been lost to time, and the person who had originally set up the subscription to Azure had left many moons prior. As had the back up contact. And the back up, back up contact. I vividly recall his notes on this matter, they read ""Nothing to be done about this, issue is with SharePoint team to resolve. They said we should hope it never breaks."" And here I was, responsible in the eyes of my boss, my team and the whole Sales Team for finding out what was wrong. 

I spent an hour trying to get the SharePoint Team to pick up the phone, while getting my team to download and back up any live projects on the platform in case the whole thing fell over. Eventually, I gave up on trying to call the SharePoint team directly, and hit up the staff directory to find (vaguely) sensible people who worked in the same office as them. I called up an Internal Account Manager who owed me a favour, and convinced him to wander the building with his mobile phone, and to put the thing in the hand of anyone from the SharePoint team. Thankfully, that only took him fifteen minutes. 

The Head of SharePoint he found sounded quite stressed (given we were his largest internal client, and well known for being influential I can understand why), but was professional as we tried to narrow down the problem. All the connections and bits we could see were functioning. There was something almost blocking the traffic to the Azure Site Builder. We checked with Internal IT, no new firewalls, nothing new on the network. We decided that we absolutely had to see what was inside Azure, and we would have to work out what the password was. Internal IT brought back up the email of the former staff member who had set up this portion of Azure in the first place, and routed any incoming mail to the Head of SharePoint, while he tried to reset the password. 

The reset came through, we were still on the phone and crowed in victory! He reset the password, to be met with a large warning that the bill for Azure hadn't been paid. Curious and curiouser, I agreed to speak with the Finance department to work out why our payment had failed, only to find that we had never paid anything of that (relatively small, several hundred pound) value to Azure, and certainly not for the six years our instance of SharePoint had been working.

I'm unclear on the exact thoughts going through the Head of SharePoint's head as the penny dropped while he paged through paid invoices on what he could see of Azure, but I do know it resulted in a lot of swearing, and a shout across the office. A mumbled conversation I couldn't hear, and finally back to the phone to speak to me. ""We need to get this paid for, today, using the company card.""

Well that was something I could do, we had bribery chocolates stored in a cupboard, and a quick run upstairs to the CEO's PA got the invoice paid within twenty minutes, and SharePoint site builder running another twenty minutes after that. 

It was another few hours before I managed to unearth the reason the bill had gone unpaid - and how it had previously been paid. When it had originally been set up, for some odd quirk, the account wasn't linked to the company accounts at all. It was listed to the person who had left. And he'd paid it on his own card, and put the figure back on expenses, every month until he left, and he handed over the invoices to his replacement, who paid it on his own card and expensed it every month until he left. And then, it had been passed over to another SharePoint consultant who was paid a little bit less money (if this was because she was the only woman on the team, I don't know, but I have my suspicions). And so, close to Christmas, her credit card bounced and she couldn't make the payment. Over time, the information of what this payment was for had been lost to the winds, and so she resolved to pay it at the end of the week, when she got paid, and hopefully nothing would break in that time. 

There was quite some upset when it made the rounds of senior management, three successive Heads of SharePoint had collectively signed off over ten thousand pounds in expenses for this Site Builder, and had never questioned it. Expenses rules were tightened, and time passed, and the SharePoint team, always a low revenue earning team, was eventually phased out entirely. 

This year, I started a new job at a new company, but I still stay in touch with a few people at the big IT company. A week after I left, SharePoint went down again, but this time entirely. They couldn't work out why  it was broken, and now nobody in the business had the skills to fix it. I'm glad I missed that headache. I hear they've now switched to Teams.",803,0,1
It still turns on. How.,"A few years ago I was at work and a customer sold us his custom-build gaming tower. It was a nice one too with LED strips, light-up fans, an i7-8700K, an Asus ROG motherboard (that ended up being worth over €300 even used), a 2TB Samsung SSD and a liquid-cooled MSI Sea Hawk card - don't remember exactly what it was, a GTX 1080 maybe? The horror really begins with the entire interior of the computer being just ... **CAKED** in a centimeter thick orange-brown coating composed of dust, cat hair and smoke. And the smell. Oh god the smell. The computer also legit looked like it was used more as a loo than something you'd game with. 

And somehow, against all odds. This **stanky boi** actually turned on and booted. No magic smoke or fire or explosion. But of course there was plenty of that **stank** being wafted around the store once the fans went on and I was of course on task to meticulously clean all the filth out of anything valuable inside it. Oh and everything was all nasty and ""oily"" once I got all the unholy mess of dust off. It took quite a while to scrub the oil (and the smell) off with isopropyl alcohol and a test to ensure that everything STILL worked by some divine intervention. 

I should also mention that I was literally ill the next day, likely from cleaning out a ""highway rest stop"" gaming tower, the ""yes, I actually need to take paid sick leave"" off work kind of sick.",1337,0,1
The broom of server death,"Edit: the server and the firewall Linux were both towers. Enclosure does mean rack but the specific devices were not rack mounted.

Since my last post got traction, I promised I will write about the ransomware panic of days long past. This, however is not that post.

The broom of death has its origins in lost times when server cabinets were invented. 

Now, cleaning staff is not allowed in the server room since the server room is considered secure and might also contain a safe(for whatever reason).

At that time I was responsible for 9 locations-translated to 9 servers and obviously 9 server rooms
And out of those 9, a particular one stood out because I would always receive a call Friday night, usually at around 10 that the internet was not working. Now this became so normal that I would have a connection script ready for them that I would just activate as soon as they called, and this script would turn on their VPN. 

Anyway, this one night, I was out and not having a good time. The call came in well past midnight so I didn't even want to answer. They insist; ""what?"" ""Well, the usual, internet is down"". ""How the hell do you constantly lose internet on a Friday evening?"" I say disappointed. ""Well it's the weekly cleaning of the server"" she replies. ""The server room you mean!"" ""Yeah"" she says. ""Well I'm not fixing it now, I'm out, call me in the morning"" ""b-but the end of day reports, the files"". ""I don't care, it's been almost a year now, and every Friday you have the same issue, call me tomorrow"".

I wake up, grumpy and hungover, no call. I call back, 'is your internet working?"" ""Yea, it came back in the morning"", ""ok, I'm coming over"". 4 hour drive, I call my coworker from the other area ""hey, did you get a call from , location?"" , ""Yeah, you refused to help them so I had to fix the connection at 1 AM!"" ""Yeah, thanks, we'll talk on Monday""

I get there, burst into the office, and politely ask the manager to show me how she 'cleans the server'. She refuses, citing heavy workload. I remind her that she calls me every Friday and I don't need her to clean the server, just show me what she does, and if I have to spend one more minute asking, the entire building will lose any trace of technology with the press of a button. She complies.

We get in the server room: ""you won't get mad, are you?"" ""No, I just want to know how you spend your Friday evenings"", she takes a key, opens the server enclosure, takes apart the side panel and shows me where she sticks a broom inside the enclosure. All this time she complains about wires coming off of the machines and she having to plug them back in.

My mind is blown, I chuckle.",670,0,1
Check where you pay for your software!,"I was the senior IT guy in the company for 2 months now. I was still a bit overwhelmed by the job but slowly getting on top of it.
I get a call on the company phone, it's someone speaking English. It's one of the senior managers, 3rd in the country ranking: ""I need you in the head office now!"", ""Can I know what this is about?"" ""Yeah, we have a serious IT issue, come over now!"" ""OK, you do know it's a 6 hour drive"" ""Of course I know that, who do you take me for, there's a cab waiting for you outside your office and a plane ticket will be mailed shortly, don't miss the flight""

Well, this must be serious. 2 and a half hours later I'm in the head office, the accounting department looks like a hostage situation, everyone is nearly crying, top management is shouting.
""W-what happened?"" One of the senior accountants calls me over, shows me a software interface, and error messages with every attempt to operate it.
I whisper ""how bad is this?"" ""Well nobody can do their job, and we have a pending audit"" ""shit, when did it start?"" 
""There was an update yesterday before days end""
I setup in an empty cubicle, as opposed to the main IT office in the same building. I am lost: I had never seen that software, never once been called about it, and it was never mentioned as being my responsibility. I call my manager (as a side note, it management was global, while I was the senior one in the country) ""hi, we have a serious problem with X software, I don't really know what to do"" ""don't do anything, it's not your job"" ""sigh""
I do the only sensible thing and attempt to contact the software provider. ""Hello, I am ..., Calling on behalf of ... Company from the {country}, we have a problem since the last software update"" ""erm, where are you calling from?"" ""{Country}"" ""erm, please hold"" 5 minutes go by
""Sorry sir, but we have no clients in {country}"", ""dude, what?"", ""Our last patch removed support for document formats from {country}""
""So what can we do, is there a rollback possible?"" ""No, as I stated, we don't have any clients in {country}, therefore we are unable to offer support""

I straighten my back, go into the management office to the guy that brought me here in the first place. I tell him what I found out. His eyes widen, almost become teary. ""How could this happen?"" ""Well, I'd say we need to find out who pays for this software and correct this, can I go home now?""
2 hours later I'm on the plane back.

Next day the mistery was solved: the software provider was never aware of us since the parent company paid for our licenses in a different country. The support they removed took 3 weeks to put back in, and the provider had to hire previous contractors to come and help our accounting department get back on track.

TL:DR: parent company paid for our software in another country. The software provider removed support for our country since they had no idea about us and had lost its last client in the country.",1478,0,1
"Tech savvy parents, usually","Firstly, let me start by explaining my parents are pretty tech savvy, they understand the concepts of cpu/ram/hdd, know to keep things up to date, ignore foreign princes and calls from microsoft, find the right download button etc. 

So usually when they call it's something more serious. But sometimes even savvy people make mistakes...

###Story 1

So I get a call from my mum one sunny day. For context we're in the UK, and usually internet is via the phone line unless you have cable.

&gt;**Mum:** Hey, our internet is down.

&gt;**Me:** OK let's check through the basics _(I check with Mum that they've run through the restarting things, checking connections - and as I expected they had)_

&gt;**Me:** Hmm, let's check what the router says. Hit 192.168.0.1 and login. _Me directs her to router status page, this was many years ago with a DG834 so it's got some logging, but a bit vague._

&gt;**Mum:** ""LCP is not allowed to come up"" _(or something along those lines, I forget)_

&gt;**Me:** Well that's pretty vague, let's just check the (RJ11) cable and microfilter.

&gt;_**Dad** just goes and replaces both as they have them spare_

&gt;**Mum:** Still nothing. Same thing in the status window.

&gt;**Me:** Let me double check the $Telco status page... Nothing at $Telco is up for your area. I'll come over and have a look, I'll bring a spare modem/router. _($Telco loves to threaten charges for engineer visits for end-user issues)_.

I arrive. Hellos/hugs etc.

I notice her mobile on the side table... and have a horrible dawning realisation.

&gt;**Me:** Please tell me you checked the landline phone.

&gt;_**Mum** gets a concerned look as I move to pick up the phone. My expression says it all._

&gt;**Phone dial tone:** _silence_

&gt;**The Room:** _silent disbelief_

&gt;**Crickets:** _chirping away_

A group facepalm follows.

It probably should have occurred to me during diagnosis, but sometimes obvious things slip by. I didn't realise they'd called from mum's mobile (they had free minutes on the mobiles and not on the landline any more).

&gt;**Me:** Yeah, your phone line is dead.

&gt;**Mum:** I'll call $Telco...

###Story 2

My parents had agreed to do some digitising old photos and negatives for some family friends, they have a nice high end Epson scanner with all the bells and whistles, from about 10 years ago.

I get a call from mum, we usually use speakerphone to chat to people in each room.

&gt; **Mum:** Hey, we just got the photo scanner back out, and it's not working. No lights on at all.

&gt; _I direct them to check it over for any obvious signs of damage or moisture ingress, it's been in storage for a while. Nothing obvious wrong_

&gt; **Me:** OK, do you guys have a multimeter about? For testing voltages? (This scanner uses a separate inline transformer).

&gt; **Mum:** A multi-what? _(Ok, I expected that)_

&gt; **Dad:** I think I've got one of those in the shed. _(I expected that also)_

&gt;_**Dad** goes and returns with multimeter_

&gt; **Me:** Test the **output** of the adapter with it plugged in the wall - **carefully** (not knowing what damage may have been done).

&gt; **Dad:** Looks like ""0"".

&gt; **Me:** 0 what? Is it set to volts?

&gt; _Turns out this multimeter is also ancient, of questionable provenance, and the display obscure. I'm unconvinced the multimeter is providing useful readings_

&gt; **Me:** Erm, I'll come over with my multimeter just to check, before you spend money on a replacement transformer.

&gt; _**Me** goes over and checks, verifies it's dead as a dodo_

They get a replacement from eBay, as it's a generic Epson inline transformer. All good.

######_One week later_

&gt; **Mum:** Sooo... The scanner is dead.

&gt; **Me:** What? Really? After you got it working with the new transformer?

&gt; **Mum:** Yeah, no lights, nobody is home.

&gt; _I start a mental inventory of the tools I'll need to take it apart_

&gt; **Me:** Tried unplugging and replugging etc?

&gt; **Mum:** Yup _(I can hear her do it again right there, both power and usb)_

&gt; **Me:** OK, I'll come on over and take a look at it, but no guarantees I'll get it working.

I head over and take a look, I start by double checking the cheapo eBay inline transformer, it's providing a nice stable voltage. Plug it all back in and nothing.

I unpack screwdrivers, multimeter etc. ready to take it apart and diagnose.

Then I notice the power switch on the scanner is OFF.

&gt; **Me:** **Please tell me you turned the scanner ON when you tried to use it?**

&gt; _Both parents immediately turn completely and entirely red_

&gt; _**Me immediately starts laughing so hard my sides hurt, and I can't breathe long enough to talk**_

To say I nearly wet myself laughing at their expense is an understatement. They used to (and still do) turn it on/off as and when they use it and finish using it, but to miss such a dumb step this time really embarrassed them. We all had a big laugh out of that one.

Thank you for... precisely nothing.,"Before we begin this wild one there is a disclaimer:
Yes, I am a high school student.  You can volunteer for the IT department during studyhalls, please don't argue about this, everyone likes to tell me I'm lying about it.  It's not commonplace but my school has it.  I'm also on mobile, so formatting.  Ok, let's go.

I'm sitting in the tech support room, and a student brings in a laptop, with a damaged USB port.  It's not a small amount either, the plastic insert (it's Type A) is completely bent to the other side, and I can't get it to work.  Ordinarily I'd just bend it back, but these devices were still under warranty.  (computer company) provides very nice warranties on school devices, so good that you can just send in the device in basically any condition and get it back like new in a few weeks.  So, we decide it's best to send it out for warranty repair, and we mark the system clearly ""Damaged USB port, repair USB port"".  These laptops only had 1 USB port so there should be no confusion.  Or so we thought.

Some time passes, and we get the thing back from repair.  I'm just bringing in the devices that we got back (they come in batches) and preparing deliveries for the students who's laptops had just returned, when I hear one of the adult members chuckle a bit.  I figure it's nothing much, but he asks me to come look at this.  Inside each repaired machine, the company puts a paper inside telling you what was done (sort of like an invoice).  On the paper for the system with the broken USB port, it shows that the device was sent to the repair station for repair, and the person who did the repair commented ""USB port damaged, needs repair"" and sent the computer back to us.  They did not fix anything, in fact I don't even think they opened the case.  We were both cracking up at this point, because they did the exact thing we did, which was label the problem, and even when sent to the repair desk they did nothing.  Thankfully (computer company) is usually pretty good about these things and these sorts of issues rarely happen, but it was still hilarious.

TL;DR: Sent laptop for warranty repair, technician states the obvious and fixes nothing",292,0,1
Ethernet Cable... You Mean A Charger?,"Hello all, I'm back with another fun story. This is a story that happened a few days ago, but is still makes me chuckle and die a little inside at the same time.

A new user called into the help desk to assist in a first time login, because the computer she's on was not connect to the companies network so it wouldn't recognize her domain credentials. The fix for this is very simple though. Plug in an ethernet cable in a core office location. That's it, that is all there is to it. It should be pretty simple right? Well if it was I wouldn't be posting the story here.

The call goes something like this;

&gt;Me: Thank you for contacting the \[insert company name here\] Helpdesk, my name is EonThief how can I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: I'm a new employee and I need help logging into the computer.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I can definitely assist with that, are there any error messages on the screen when you try and login?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: Yeah.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Can you please read them for me?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: Yeah it says the domain isn't available or something like that.

Normally I ask for the error verbatim but in this case there are only two causes for this type of error, either the computer isn't on the domain or, as I said above, not connected to the network. I checked AD and it was indeed on the domain.

&gt;Me: So that computer is on the domain, are you currently in a core office location?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: Yeah I'm in an office.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Alright, I need you to plug an ethernet cable into the computer and try to login again.  
&gt;  
&gt;User: What's that?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: It's a network cable, it connects you to the network.  
&gt;  
&gt;User: (who clearly didn't listen) Is it like a charger or something?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: No it's a network cable, it connects you to the network.  
&gt;  
&gt;User: Oh, we don't have one of those here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Do you know what one looks like?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: No.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay, then you might not know if you have any at that location.  
&gt;  
&gt;User: What do they look like?

Now fellow redditors, I know this might not be a great way to describe an ethernet cord but it's worked for me in the past.

&gt;Me: The end of it looks like a phone cable but it's bigger.  
&gt;  
&gt;User: Oh I have one of those in my desktop.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay well I'm gonna need you to take the cable out of your desktop and plug it into your laptop.  
&gt;  
&gt;User: No.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I'm sorry?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: I'm not going to do that it might mess up the desktop.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: It won't, the only thing it will do it temporarily disconnect it from the network.  
&gt;  
&gt;User: But that will mess it up.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I can assure you it won't.  
&gt;  
&gt;User: I'm just gonna find a different ether-whatever and I'll call back.

With that she hung up. I never found out if she ever called back in, I can only hope that she isn't as difficult as she was with me.",1312,0,1
Well that was the power cord.,"I work for an insurance agency in their tech support. I mostly do training of our new associates and project work for our department, but when I was still taking our internal 'customers' (Read: Employees of said Insurance company) I had this interaction with someone.

Before I get to the interaction; it is important to understand, I give incredibly descriptive but dumbed down and easy to follow instructions. (Which is why I am a trainer now)

Interaction Follows:

Me: IT Support. This is &lt;Me&gt; can I start with your &lt;credential verification process &gt;
Customer: &lt;Gives credentials&gt;
Me: How can I help you today?
Customer: &lt;Long winded explanation of nothing to do with current issue that is currently murdering my handling time of this call&gt; ... I can't log into my Computer.

Me: Okay. Well I can help you with that. Let me take a look at your profile.
&lt;Checking Active Directory&gt;
Me: I saw that your profile was locked out and I went ahead and unlocked you. Can you go ahead and try and log in for me with your Windows password?
Customer: It still won't let me in and I know I'm typing my password correctly.

&lt;Asked customer to try again to confirm the domain/proxy controller wasn't locking her out&gt;

Me: Okay usually when you get locked out and attempt to sign in too many times the system essentially 'disables' your network. Could you please shut down your computer for me? 
Customer: I don't want to do that I have work I didn't save and it takes forever to turn back on, I never restart it.

&lt;Pulling up our system monitoring software and seeing that this user has an uptime of 294 hours and internally sighing&gt;

Me: That's okay we can cycle the network another way. On the back of the computer there will be a lot of black cables and there is only one blue or green cable. That cable also has an end that is plugged into your computer that is clear and looks like an old phone jack with a pull clip on the top. This cable is also the only cable that goes from the computer to your desk phone. Do you see this cable?
Customer: Yes!
Me: Go ahead and disconnect that cable for thirty seconds and plug it back in.

Customer: My computer just shut off?!?!?!?
Me: Which cable did you unplug?
Customer: The thick black one.
Me: Well, that was your power cable......

My phone is displaying cow skulls!,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

This one is short and sweet for you! I had one of my favorite users call me telling me she was having issues with her desk phone. Here is how that call went:  


Lorixs: Thank you for calling tech support, this is Lorixs.

&amp;#x200B;

Sophie: Hello Lorixs! I'm having a really strange issue with my phone on my desk

&amp;#x200B;

Lorixs: Sure, what seems to be the problem?

&amp;#x200B;

Sophie: Well all of my calls are going straight to voicemail

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I was pretty sure she must have set her phone to DND

&amp;#x200B;

Lorixs: On the screen of your desk phone, along the left you should see some icons. Do you see what looks like a phone with a checkmark next to it?  or is it a phone with a little circle and a line going through it?

Sophie: Ummm....neither? I'm seeing like....a deer? with antlers? but its tilted to the side...oh wait it looks like one of those things in Texas....a cow skull!  


Lorixs: A cow skull?

Sophie: Yeah! or maybe even a reindeer...but its tilted.

The one that got away,"As a tech, the worst kind of case is the unicorn that's impossible to diagnose.
It happened when was working at the front desk of a laptop repair shop, back in the early 2010s.
A perfectly normal day, when a perfectly normal guy walks in holding the perfectly normal Toshiba Satellite Core2Duo with 4 GB DDR2 RAM, sporting a Windows 7 clean as a whistle.
""I need you to fix this laptop and I need it quick""

""Well, what's wrong with it?""

""It crashes""

""Ok, we'll check it out and let you know""

As the front desk it was my job to do a basic diagnosis on every laptop before it was assigned to a tech. 
Software issues were strictly front desk issues. 
So I take the guys laptop, remove the harddrive, put in my all knowing test OS and start blasting the laptop with primes, stress tests, ram tests, the real deal.
Nothing, that laptop is rock solid. 
I call the guy: "" look, your laptop is fine, it's most likely a software issues, can we take a look at your harddrive?"" He replies ""anything, just fix it"". So I plug the HDD back in, go for a smart check and then for a quick scan. Nothing. I start it up, no windows password, licenced av installed, check event viewer. Nothing. 

I call the guy: "" I am checking your laptop, I did my best, but I just can't make it crash"" to which he replies coldly ""try Google"".
So I open the browser with full confidence, i type in Google.com and hit enter, I see the page for about 1 second and BOOM, blue screen. 

Ok, I got it to crash. Let's try internet explorer, BOOM, crash.
Ok, let's try the test drive again, IT MUST BE A SOFTWARE ISSUE.
BOOM, Kernel Panic! Ok, this just got weird. I turn to the hammer, HIRENS. Nothing crashes a HIRENS, I boot from USB, turn on network, start the browser, and yeah: BSOD on a HIRENS.

Now I'm getting intrigued: IT'S the NIC; eth or WiFi? Doesn't matter, I'll replace the WiFi and check the eth as well. Blue Screen, every single time. I even try other websites, they last one second longer than Google does.

I get frustrated, time to replace RAM, Blue Screen.
Time to replace the CPU, luckily it was a socketed one, blue screen.
 I get the techs involved, show them the kernel panic, the HIRENS failing. The WiFi, the CPU, the RAM. 
Let's change some chips! Out goes the north bridge, out goes the south bridge, full bios reset, every chip with more than 20 pins goes out and a new one goes in place. We are already overtime but nobody wants to leave and miss the end, so we decide to come back first thing in the morning and get to the bottom of it.
Turns are taken on the microscope, we map the entire motherboard, every capacitor is measured. Nothing.
We put it back together, some 200$ worth of chips went in.
And Blue Screen.
Just as we give up, the guy walks in. ""Is it fixed?"" ""Yea, we fixed every potential future and passed problem! But it still refuses to run Google"". We gave it back to him, free of charge as we couldn't fix the issue. He was mad as hell when he saw the list of operations we had done ""all for nothing!? I need this for work"" ""sorry bud, it's a perfectly good laptop as long as you don't open Google""",168,0,1
"Tech dejavu: or, another email about email being down","Recently there was an email issue out of our control. But on the intermittent side, it was really an auth issue to be technical. If you were already signed in you were fine, if you had to sign in or sync MDM you were boned.

I'm on call but done for the day, so I asked someone else who was still on to monitor and keep me updated if anything changes and I needed to jump online and let him know email wasn't working on my phone. 

I get back online a few hours later for something else.... only to discover he kept emailing updates....

Even better, I called him out for emailing me about email issues when he knew I wasn't receiving email, and his response was ""but I emailed the whole team, so it doesn't matter if you missed it"". 

I had to remind him that I was the on call tech that week and I was the one who would be jumping back online if need be and that no one else would be getting email on their phones either because of this issue and he was the only one still on his computer working... so no, no one got his message until they got back to a computer. 

He still didn't get it, but I let it drop at that point because it wasn't worth the energy. If a tech can't understand you don't email about email outages I just have zero  faith in humanity anymore.",189,0,1
Can't you make Google do this?,"So, I'm the Web developer for a marketing agency. For the past 3-4 months our SEO guru and I have had the following conversation with our Account Specialists repeatedly:

AS: ""Hey, you said you published that page an hour ago, but I'm not seeing any search results for it yet.""

Us: ""Yeah...you won't. It's published and the site map is updated but you'll need to wait for Google to re-scan the site. That can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks if you're really unlucky, and then it may not rank right away.""

AS: ""That's unacceptable. Can you not make Google scan the site faster?""

US: ""Well we can request Google to re-index the site, but it really doesn't seem to help much. They will index it when they index it. It still probably won't rank that quick.""

Hours later.....

AS: ""Hey I hit that button in the search console to request a re-index and the page is still not showing.""

US: ""Like we said. It will take Google a few days, possibly longer.""

AS: ""The client needs this page to show in search results. I insist you call Google and make them add it.""

US: ""Yeah....we'll get right on that.""

Evidently they read a misinformed blog article on this and took it for fact, so our solution was to turn it around on them.

US: ""Hey, Google really needs to speak to the people in charge of these clients. They won't even talk to us, so unfortunately you need to call them.""

AS: ""That's wonderful. I'll call them right now.""

Haven't heard another peep out of them.

"Solutions not appreciated, rather waste time and resources","I used to work as functional support engineer for 2 closely linked applications (in practice I also acted as application and technical support engineer) at a company that provided business to consumer technical services. To make matters worse I was the only one that oversaw the entire chain of applications. Much more applications like network management systems, CRM and middleware were involved for the services provided to customers.

&amp;#x200B;

We had outsourced software customization and more importantly systems integration to a third party supplier (1 of the biggest consultancy companies in the world), where our corporate mother had so called specialists (a lot of them insourced from said third party). One of the 2 applications 1 was responsible for was to meat a regulatory requirement and it was a highly specialized application. The official technical and application support at corporate regularly screwed up. And this was nothing different when setting up the test environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when we started the acceptance testing for new software releases I was to clear my schedule to execute these tests. In the beginning I complied. This was in a time that I already worked standard 90 hour weeks. Usually it took more than a week of the 2 weeks of testing to get the environment up and running. However I needed be present full time and I was strictly forbidden to work on production issues, because how time critical testing was. But I couldn't anything testing wise, so I started working on production issues. I was reprimanded for this a couple of times. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I started digging into the backend of of the applications in the test environment in order to seem busy and not to do production work. Even the application vendors helped me in understanding the environment, so soon enough I knew what the crucial points were and how to fix them, which I did. I'd say a win win situation... Wrong!!! I even got an official warning when I finally got the end to end process to work, since I couldn't have access to the back end or to the actual servers and that to fix these problems was the application and technical support staff's duty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next releases I just showed up about half an hour early before the official kick off, did some basic system tests and logged about 5-6 highest priority incidents about the environment not up and running. Then I sat down and started drinking coffee, chitchatting with other colleagues, just as long as I was around the test area. I refused to answer anything about production issues, since that already got me reprimanded before. However being the sole expert on the end to end process, I got a backlog in production issues that needed fixing. Which in term lead to big customer facing problems and complaints, but hey I wasn't allowed to do anything for production.

&amp;#x200B;

So after a couple of releases in which this happened my manager gave me permission that I would plan my time accordingly, so usually I was done in my 1st week of testing even before the official testing window started, due to the fact that the environment wasn't working.

Passcode skeleton key.,"I used to work for a call center that was trained in helping people resolve technical issues with their devices. I am only trained for a specific type of device species that I like to call The Forbidden Fruit. One day, a guy and his son call in because his son forgot the passcode to unlock his phone. I hated these calls because if you can't remember it, or it isn't working, the only way for us to help resolve it is to completely erase the device; The father started out very nice, not overly tech savy but not a complete peanut brain thankfully. We got through the initial greeting and then got down to the root of the problem. 

Dad: He's forgotten the password for his phone, how do we go about getting around that so he can get into his phone? 

Me, already feeling the pain of having to tell him the bad news: I'm so sorry, but if the passcode is forgotten the only way to remove it is to restore the device via computer; And I am absolutely able to walk you through that if you need. 

Dad: Don't you guys have a special 'unlock all' that can get around this?

Me: No, unfortunately we don't, I'm so sorry about that. 

Dad: That's stupid, you should have one of those because people forget their passwords all the time; You should be able to prepare for that and help us get into our phones.

Me: It would be a really great idea in theory, but they don't have one just to make sure there's no risk to your privacy. They want to protect that for you. (This is the answer given to us in training.) 

Dad: I understand that, but you don't have to give it out to the world, you can just get in my phone and unlock. Just access it remotely or whatever.

Me: That in itself poses a threat to security and privacy. If we gave it out to everyone then there wouldn't.....be a point to the passcode (I hated saying it like this but I'm terrible as explaining things in a kind way.) 

Dad: You don't have to tell people, just access my \*expletive\* phone and put it in yourself.

Me: We actually can't take control of a device at any time. If the device is unlocked we can share the screen but we can't take over. Again I'm really sorry about this, but the only way to get around it is erasing the phone.

Dad: Your company are \*expletive\* idiots! They can't actually expect people to remember their passwords! We shouldn't have to lose everything on our phones just because we forgot the password!

Me: I completely understand your frustration, I've done it to myself before and it's not a good time when it happens, but 'forbidden fruit' wants to protect privacy over everything else. If a person chooses to use a passcode to protect their data, they're saying they only want the people that know that code to get that information. 

Dad: Well \*expletive\* you (click)",255,0,1
The Computers-and-Google Consipiracy,"I installed Lastpass and set up user accounts for every PC in the company, and even set up the majority of their passwords, then trained each user on how to use it.  I still get at least one call for password issues per week. 

This particular one has happened at least five times now, different websites, same user:

  
""Something is wrong with my computer it won't let me in"". 

""Did you check to make sure your password was entered correctly and the caps was off?""

""No, I already know I entered it correctly""

""Ok, try again"". 

""Still not working""

(boot up my computer, look up master password file that I keep for situations like this) ""Did you try XYZ?""

""No, that's not my password"". 

""Well that's what I set it as. Did you change it?""

""No."" 

""Ok, \*sigh\*, let me remote in really quick""

(remoted in, puts in password, opens fine)

""Well, there it is"". 

""Yes, but the computer won't let me into Google"".

\*silent pause, crickets chirping\*

""What were you trying to get into?""

(Names off website we've been using for years)

""Okay, well that's not the same as your computer login.  Have you looked on LastPass to see what password you had set?""

""No, I don't really know what that is so I never use it"". 

\*heavier sigh, does another LastPass training, discovers they either knew password all along and forgot to take off Capslock or was trying to use PC login, or had forgotten password altogether and just needed to click on the LastPass icon for it to enter automatically.\*. 

Come to find out, they were actually rebooting the PC every time they didn't put the correct password in, thinking the PC was conspiring with Google to not let them on to the websites they wanted. By rebooting, they thought it would trick the PC into letting them onto the website. 

This repeats with various different websites, and each time the Operations Manager will casually mention later how I need to ""fix the issue with the computers and Google so it lets people into the websites they need to get on"".

User didn’t want me to read error message!,"Ok so this was a while ago, I was in tech support and got a case where a user had an issue when he logged in, the case said something like “User can’t find any of his files on the computer.”

I immediately called him and asked for some more info, he said that there was a some kind of message popping up when he tried to log in but it dissapeared too quickly so he didn’t know what it said.

I went to his office, tried to log in with my account and had no problems. Asked him to log in with his and saw a message pop up. But as soon as the message came he immediately took the mouse from me and clicked the X before I could even blink.

I asked him why and said I now have to log out again and see if it comes up again.

He was very confused to why I had to do this.

So I logged out, asked him to log in again, same thing happened AGAIN!

I had to do it again and this time I stopped him, turned out he had been logged in with a temporary profile and needed a restart the computer to fix the problem, the message said it all.

Restarted the computer and everything was fine after that.

Welcome to Bob's iPhone,"Somehow I got to be the go to guy for the sales reps in the company even though I was a programmer/business analyst.  I had been there a long time and worked with many of these guys before.

I got a call one day from Bob.  He was very apologetic saying ""I know this isn't your job but the corporate help desk told me to go to cell provider and cell provider says there is no problem."" He said his iPhone's hotspot was great but had a tendency to not work well in certain places.  At least he was observant enough to say ""works great in rest areas and hotels but can be flakey in restaurants and airports"".

researched and found that the name of the network was the name on the iPhone.  Called him back and he told  me it was ""Bob's iPhone"".  I had him add some characters and numbers to it to make it unique.  My best guess was that other non creative Bobs had their iPhone hotspot on and he would catch occasional conflicts when in a crowded area.  I called him back a couple of months later and he said problem solved.

It's a phone cable,"This just happened. I'll keep this short and sweet. 

So I've been working on getting a label printer connected to a client's network for 3 days. It's mostly due to being so busy but I digress.

They got two of these. One connected without an issue. The other didn't. They were both DHCP so I would have to statically assign them the IP they need. Got the first working no problem.

The second would never get on the network. See where I'm going with this? I had the client plug it into the switch when they said the cord wouldn't fit because it was a phone cable. I died a little inside. 3 days of troubleshooting....

Green is a bad sign in a printer,"So today I am called to help my neighbour, as her little Canon all singing all dancing ink devouring printer is not working. Go there, do the usual checks, paper in printer, there is ink, it is turned on and plugged in, then go do the test page. Printer does the usual spray half the cartridge into the foam, paper feeder tries to pick up a page, and whirrs, then stops, paper jam. 

Pull paper out, look inside, and nothing really obvious. Clean rollers inside the machine, try again. Paper goes down, then stops, and there is a green line in a sensor window.  Green line should not be there, so look a bit, tilt the machine and it does move a little. Paper out, turn upside down and, holding all the loose parts, shake it, and still green line. Try to push back, using a sheet from the front, and the thing actually pulls the paper in, sensing it, and tries to bring the heads over, so a bit of cursing, and try again, pushing the green line towards the back. 

Do the pick up, hold the bits and shake, with the paper feed pointing down. No result, so harder shake, and there is a plink on the floor. One slightly mangled green coated paper clip is out. 

Place back on it's place, put the paper in, and wait, and it finally recognises there is a printer there, and it is ready. Black is low, new cartridge 2 weeks ago, and prints the head test page. Few bad dots in the colour, but not a worry, as it now prints.

I prefer laser, my mono one is now finally on it's first replacement cartridge, after 3 years of use, and it was cheaper than the pair of inkjet cartridges. If I really need colour i can drive 2km to the store where they will print the pages for me right there and then, and it is cheaper than the cost of the printer, considering I do it every 2 years or so.

\#Me, Lawful good copier tech with a true neutral inner monologue

\#Mgr, My manager, best dude I’ve ever worked for (sry dad)

\#OM, Office manager, glad someone is here to fix her problems

\#LT, Local helpdesk, bravely and foolishly dove head first into the hell that is printer service, oops

\#OG, The genesis of this story

So, I’d been to this site previously with a senior tech to set up all the dozen or so shiny MFPs they had just signed contract on. Single floor modern open concept office deal, my favorite kind of site, climate controlled, low dust, no closets to shove machines into. The ideal by the book specs for one of these machine to work in. As for the deployment, we had gotten good thorough documentation and the sales drones had even been browbeat into actually doing a site survey because it was a national account. Full support from #LT and the clients corpo tech staff, everything delivered on time and not damaged, even got one little problem with a misconfigured switch so we could claim the install had already seen its disaster come and go.

I just paint that picture for you so I can emphasize how the coming carnage ruined a perfectly good install.

So about 2 weeks go by and #Mgr calls me up, “requests” I drop whatever I’m doing (uhoh) and blast off outta my territory to clients office because usual tech is unavailable. So we (the royal we) pack up and head out asap breaking speed limits for more than just fun this time. I arrive, am buzzed in, and led to the victim. There I find #OM and #LT next to, of course, the biggest and most expensive (like 50k+, my Subaru more than twice over) machine on the contract. #OM unhappy, #LT worried, and doors wide open all over the machine. F. Step 1, ~~interrogate~~ question the ~~suspects~~ users. Same story I’m sure we’re all familiar with here. Worked the night before, morning shift said it’s broke, no prior reported issues, why’s a new machine broke so quickly, no security camera on machine, ain’t nobody know nothin’…….. sure. But we put on our professional face and assure the customer that this is something we will figure out for them and make things right. 

So, what I did get out of the 2 of them was that there was an error code, that no one had remembered or recorded, and “strange sounds”, no jams (why did I believe that?). So I reboot the machine with a service reset, expect to hear some squealing or rattling, but lord above it sounded like a scene from the exorcist. It starts to scream and grind and vibrate, stopped just short of spinning its touch screen completely around and puking developer at me when it coded out…. Fuser motor failure to turn, no shit. So open goes the side door and of course its full of jams. #OM and #LT have made themselves scarce right before I had gotten to turning it on. So I have naught but empty space to give a look of disapproval.

Fast forward past a whole bunch of disassembly, accordion-ed paper, and obliterated gears, a picture starts to form. Luckily the only section of the machine that seems to have suffered was the fusing section and associated drive. Belt, devs, drums, ect live to fail another day. But there's some paper really jammed into that fuser, and it seems to have been in there so long its clear baked onto the pressure roller. But this brings us to our problem, I’ve placated #OM for now, but she needs this machine back, and management has give me a blank check to get it done. So this is a no kidding we actually mean get this thing fixed asap. Now normally I’d just run to the warehouse and grab a replacement fuser slap it in there and get the customer back up. But this machine was bran new, new new, top of the line new, first of its kind new, still out gassing that lovely new tech smell new. And we did not have readily available spare parts for them yet, they were still busy using those new fusers coming off the line to build new machines back across the pacific. #Mgr and his boss were both being total bosses and by hook, crook, blackmail, or other unmentionable act fightin’ to get me one of those spares that may yet exist, as I had told them as the pieces begun to fall into place that such would likely be a necessity. Isn’t it great when management trusts the professional opinion that they hired you for? Back on topic, spare isn’t showing up till least the day after tomorrow, and were already an hour or 2 into ot territory, but I gotta try to get this thing back into a state in which I can at-least give it a temporary fix the next day. Talking to others I had put together that I could swap enough of the parts off of older but similar machines to get this thing working. But that roller, and the frame it was in needed to be salvaged. So after way too much gentle pulling and prying and working the edges. The paper started to come off! Yes, YES! Slowly, slowly, gently, gent….. wait a second. Why does this paper feel so heavy… and textured…. And SLIDE! SPRONG! F%^K! Nearly crapped myself as the entire rest of the paper wrapped around the roller came loose in one go. Quick check and thank the spheres there was no further damage when the stuff let go. So I turned the attention to what I had in my hands.

Time to reflect a bit.

Have you ever held a concept? The object embodiment of an idea in your hands? Smelt the odors wafting off of it? Stared at it’s physical manifestation in our plane.

The very essence of guilt, weigh heavy in my hands. It’s stink of cooked plastic and waxes stinging my nose. And its devilish, sinister mark staring me right back in the face. A MS clipart trophy wreathed by a circular marquee that read something like “Let’s go accounting, fitness champs 201x”.

…….

An iron on t-shirt transfer….. several actually….

***screams internally***

Welp, that’s enough for one day. So I pack up, stick everything in a box, leave a sign not to touch **anything** and go the F home.

… Day 2

Next morning I arrive bright and early at the warehouse and start salvaging parts off of donor machines and grabbing the new parts on my shopping list. Parts in hand, and maybe after a short stop at dunks, I’m back on site ready to solve the impossible and reign as a conquering hero. So I head over to grab the fuser from its box and tear it apart for a rebuild. And there's the clipart trophy staring right back at me… from the bottom. Of an. Empty. Box.

What have I done to accrue such a karma deficit?

Ok quick plan of action….. find manglement and work down! Break! GO!

\#ME: Hay #OM! Good mornin’. (puttin’ on that customer service voice)

\#OM: Good morning #ME

-small talk-

\#ME: so…… one issue, um. I left a bunch of parts here last night, but I think someone moved some of them. Maybe cleaning staff…..?

\#OM: Oh you mean the big part you were focusing on?

\#ME: Yes! (YES!)

\#OM: I think #LT has it

\#ME: Ok (…)

\#OM: he was taking a good look at it

\#ME: Ok (please)

\#OM: And those parts you were pointing out were bent yesterday

\#ME: Yep(no)

\#OM: He's confident he can bend them back straight again

\#ME: Ok (NO!)

\#ME: Can you point me towards his office, I have stuff to repair that part with me (NONONONONONONONONONONO!)

And there lay fuser. Murdered by the best of intentions. The frame holding the pressure mechanism mangled beyond saving.

\#LT: So I got some pretty good needle nose and vice grips so I thought I could maybe get it straight and us back up this morning

\#ME: So… no luck? (just goin thru the motions)

\#LT:  I mean you got the parts to fix it up anyways, so what's the harm

\#ME: …

\#LT: …

\#ME: …

\#LT: …

\#ME: …

\#LT: You… You do have the parts you need?

And this is the point where I have to turn to give #LT the look. 
Not the angry look. 
Or even the you dun fucked up look. 
But the sad look. The one that says “sorry son, I know we promised you a bike for xmas, but we just don’t have the money this year”

\#ME: not anymore.

Aftermath

Well #LT was worried, but I’m not gonna throw the man under the bus. I wrote the fuser off as ending up, unfortunately, not being salvageable even with the repair parts (yanno, like a liar). Past the time it would take to get the machine back up and running nothing was lost as the entire fuser was to be replaced anyways once the spare was sourced.

But there remains but one more player in our tale of carnage and woe. #OG

So nursing the fresh emotional wounds of finding my one hope to resolve this dead on a work bench, I track down #OM and explain my findings from the previous evening, presenting to her scrutiny the icon of guilt I had extracted. Some people were called and conversations were had and in lockstep with #OM we charged to confront the guilty party. I had yet to notice the hesitation in her gait.

Then in front of us was the genesis of these events. Behind her desk sitting in her chair equipped with one of those wooden bead back manager mats you normally associate with cab drivers. Staring completely unaware of the consequences of her careless actions.

In front of us sat this woman. This woman who had offered me candy from the bowl on her desk. Who had chatted me up about how her husband used to ride a motorcycle like mine before he passed. Who would share tales about her grand kids. Who wore decorative sweaters it looks like she knit herself. Who had rosey cheeks and always seemed to talk in a sweet and cheery voice. Who looked like she was 10 seconds from fetching a pan of fresh baked cookies magically from below her desk. In front of me sat this lovely sweet woman, in a cubicle filled with cat plushies and pictures of her grand kids. Oh no! In front of me sat office grandma, blissfully unaware she just cost the company 5 figures in parts and service.

**I… I.. I can’t hold this woman accountable for this!**

And again thank the stars no one else could either. She had previously used the tshirt transfers in her home printer and thought they would be great for making some custom shirts to raise office morale. The most me or #OM could muster was a little finger waggle and an explanation its bad for these kinds of printers. What about all the missing sheets that ended up in the fuser. Didn't even notice and didn't know the new machine was not supposed to sound like a diesel truck. And that was it……

Really. No fallout. No one got in trouble. Customer was ready to pay the entire cost of the event, but my management (completely unnecessarily and unprompted) offered to eat half the cost. 2 days later the fuser arrived from whatever sealed bunker it was being kept locked away in. And that was many hours of my life I'll never get back. Now 5 more after writing this monstrous 2000+ word post. 


So. Sleep time for me.

Pour one out for our dead homie, fuser.

Be cautious of the ignorant and well intentioned.

Good night, and good luck.

I found a LIVE cockroach inside a 14 year old’s computer.,"So I work as IT at a school. The other day a student came in saying their screen was having problems and their computer was being “glitchy”. I assumed it was probably a screen cable or connection issue, so I popped it open to check inside. As soon as I open it, a half inch cockroach began scurrying around the computer, eventually running underneath the motherboard. I’ve seen some very disgusting things, but never have I seen a LIVE cockroach in a CHILD’s computer. The kid got his laptop back, and it turned out that it was a motherboard issue, but this heavily disgusts me.  All I could think about was that poor kids home life, which somehow resulted in a live cockroach ending up in his school laptop. (Also, fun fact: our school offers a class called computer technician- it teaches kids how to repair the school laptops and gives them experience in the IT workplace).

My customer’s laptop shut off “For no Apparent Reason” LOL,"So this happened a few years ago. As stated in an earlier post, in my town, I am a locally known computer guy. On the side from my full-time job, I build systems for people, fix systems, set up new systems, etc.

One evening I am at home and a call came in. It is a customer I had helped many times and two years prior, helped her get a laptop and set it up for her and set up her wireless router after her Satellite Internet got installed. Satellite was her only option as she was in a very rural area.

Upon answering, my customer say’s “I have a serious problem.” I ask what was going on. She proceeds to tell me that she was using her laptop, everything was working great, and all of a sudden, it just shut itself off. Thinking to myself, that yeah that is strange, I started going through the diagnostics. I asked her first off, what she was doing when it happened. She said she was just playing on Facebook. My next thought was maybe it was sitting on her lap or on blankets or something and it over heated causing it to shut off for safety sake. So I asked if she was just sitting at her desk. She said, “No I was laying in bed.” Ahhh ok. Now we are getting somewhere. I told her that maybe the airflow was obstructed and it shut off. I asked her if the bottom felt hot. She said no, not really.

So then I said, make sure that the power adapter did not come loose from the laptop or at the power brick part. This is where it gets good. Her response was, “What power adapter?” I said, “the power for the laptop, make sure it didn’t come out of the laptop. She says, and I am not joking, “I don’t have a power adapter for this laptop.”

Ummm. I am confused. I asked her what does she mean she don’t have a power adapter for the laptop. She replied by saying, “Remember when you set this up, you set up wireless. I don’t have a power adapter for it.” Before I went further into this, I asked her if she usually lays in bed with her laptop. She said no that this was the first time she removed it from the desk and took it to her bedroom. Ahhh Haaa!

So I told her that I think the battery died and told her to take the laptop back to the desk and locate the power plug and plug the laptop back in. She argued and told me that I was not listening to her or understanding her and she insisted that there is not and never has been a power plug for the laptop. In the most professional and strategic was possible, I informed her that there is not such thing as wireless power, and that what she was referring to was wireless internet. She insisted that she has never had a power plug for the laptop but she took it back to the desk.

So after some explaining and describing the power plug and where to plug it in, she finally gets it plugged in. I tell her to hit the power button and what do ya know, it powers up. Problem solved. I explained to her that all laptops have to have a power adapter to keep the battery charged and that I assumed that when she took the laptop off of the desk, she inadvertently unplugged it and after some time the battery died causing it to shut down. At this point she was satisfied with my answer and thanked me.

HOLD ON!! IT CONTINUES!! LOL

So about now, she starts brainstorming and trying to think about how the power adapter could have come unplugged. I again tell her, that when she picked it up off of the desk and walked away, the plug probably just popped out. It was like she did not even hear my explanation. She came up with her own theory. I swear I cannot make this stuff up.

She says, “Oh I think I know how that came unplugged.” Interested I asked how. She explains that earlier in the day, she noticed her internet went out and she continues to explain that she knew the issue was snow piled up on the satellite dish. She explained how she got her broom, went outside, and swept the snow off of the dish. That is all she said lol. I sat there waiting, until she followed it up with, “So yeah I probably knocked the power cable loose when I did that.”

Not wanting to deal with this anymore, I simply said, yeah probably and ended the call. I could not bring myself to even charge her for the service call.

I will be posting more of these as I think of them. Hope you enjoyed!!

TL;DR - Customer laptop shut off, she believed that she had wireless power, did not need a power adapter,  and thought she knocked power cable loose by sweeping snow off her satellite dish! ",2544,0,1
That Time I [Single-handedly] Fixed an Aircraft....,"....for values of [Single-handedly] that include “using just one hand”. A Completely Unhelpful^TM TLDR is at the bottom

My form of Tech Support is aircraft maintenance, working on fixed-wing aeroplanes and helicopters with a value ranging from mid-five-figures to mid-eight-figures. They usually can be divided into airborne aluminium pit-ponies or their owners’ pride-and-joy; even a business jet worth more than ten million dollars can be treated as a workhorse, while a 45-year-old 40-thousand-dollar bugsmasher may be pampered by its owner.
_______________________________________________________
The events I describe here took place several years ago. 

This story begins with my colleagues and I giving a business jet back to two pilots, after we had spent [hectomonies] of the owner’s wealth in performing various maintenance tasks on it. After giving the aircraft the once-over, they climbed inside, shut the entry door and had both engines started within a few minutes. 

After a short time, silence broke out as the engines shut down again. This starting-up-then-shutting-down process is known in aircraft maintenance circles as a *Bad Thing*. My colleagues and I ~~gathered anxiously at the front of the hangar and awaited further developments with bated breath while clutching at strings of pearls~~ ignored the silence and continued to eat our lunches. 

A few moments later [Bossman] came into the lunch room and said, “hey Gert, the intercom on [RegistrationOfAircraftOutside] isn’t working; the captain can hear the copilot but can’t talk to him. Go outside and have a look at it please”.

Gertbengert: “Dang, always at lunchtime”

&amp;nbsp;

*Thinks* I know what this is. 

&amp;nbsp;

On downing my lunch-eating implements, walking outside onto the apron in front of the hangar, opening the aircrat’s door, entering the cockpit and exchanging with the pilots the basically-meaningless pleasantries dictated by polite society as being necessary in such situations, I extended my left arm (a little bit awkwardly, because there was a bone-sack in a white shirt with epaulettes impeding its progress through space and time, but mostly space), I placed my left (non-fapping, but I digress) hand’s opposable thumb - that thing which distinguishes a human from an ocelot, a giraffe, a badger, a Przewalski’s horse, a platypus, an echidna, or a cow that stands in the middle of a restaurant and recommends the best bits of itself to you for consideration as dinner (does fapping distinguish humans from other animals? I don’t know) - on the aft side of the left hand-grip on the captain’s control wheel and placed the four fingers on the forward side of the hand-grip (which is a long-winded way to say “I gripped the pilot’s control wheel”, but it wouldn’t be a Gertbengert Post^TM without a long and convoluted sentence, would it? Again, I digress - I would apologise, except for the fact that I am not sorry).

After doing the needful (a feat of the aircraft maintenance engineer’s art that took all of about two seconds) I said to the ~~Thompson twins~~ pilots, “fixed now”.

Pilots: “wait, wut?”

Me: [*explained my mad skillz using small words*]

Captain: “oh”

Me: “Safe flight guys”.

I exited the aircraft and walked back inside the hangar. 

&amp;nbsp;

“What did you do?” I hear you say. To quote Deane from *[The Curiosity Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curiosity_Show)*, “I’m glad you asked”. 

[Technical information: the crew of an aircraft typically wear headsets that allow them to communicate with each other on an intercom system and to communicate via radio with Air Traffic Control or whoever else they need to. The crew intercom is normally ‘hot microphone’ (just speak and the system takes care of the rest), while radio communications are ‘keyed mic’ (push a switch that changes the radio from Receive mode to Transmit mode and connects the headset microphone to the radio; release the switch when done talking, then headset microphone disconnects from radio and radio returns to Receive mode). On a walkie-talkie, the microphone key is typically on the side of the unit. Aircraft have a ‘push-to-talk’ switch on the control wheel (or the joystick, iffn’ that’s what the aircraft has). On this particular aircraft (and on thousands of others that have been built by the same manufacturer) each crew member’s microphone is controlled by a double-throw slide-switch that is configured ON-OFF-MOMENTARY ON. The pilot slides the switch from centre OFF to latched ON for crew intercom and usually leaves it in this position; if s/he wants to transmit on a radio, the pilot slides the switch through OFF to MOM. ON in order to engage the transmit function on the radio and to connect the headset microphone to the radio, then back to the latched ‘intercom’ position when transmissions are completed. Our antagonist Captain !Awesome (who was experienced on this type of aircraft and really should have known better) simply didn’t check the switch. I used my finger to slide the switch from the centre ‘off’ position to the ‘intercom’ position.“*This is Basil Exposition reporting; back to you in the studio*.”]

After I walked back in to the hangar, [Bossman] asked me what was the problem. 

Me: “The pilot’s a gumby drongo.”

I went back to my lunch; it hadn’t got cold. I resumed eating, serenaded by the spooling turbofans outside.

I think I'm the only person this has happened to.,"I have worked IT in a K-12 school district for the past five years. I have to preface the claim I am about to make with some background information about myself. I am a male in his 20's and am unfortunately overweight (I swear this is pertinent info). Our district has been deploying and repairing Chromebooks for our one to one device program for the past two years, so needless to say, we are pretty hands on with this particular device. 

The first of the happenings in this story came close to the beginning of one to one. I was quickly repairing a broken screen on a Chromebook. After verifying the replacement screen lit, I stood up and lifted the Chromebook to chest level to place it in the ""done"" pile. I gave the lid a satisfactory quick close for a job well done prior to setting it down. I really want to know what astronomical alignment happened at that moment, because as it became apparent in a few moments, my left manboob aligned my nipple right into the path of the rapidly closing lid. The Chromebook almost made the usual satisfying snap noise as the lid made contact with the body of the device. But this time it was slightly dampened. It felt like someone had stuck my manboob with a needle and the heat of it spread to the entirety of manboob. It took me a moment to realize what had happened. 

I had snapped a Chromebook closed on my nipple. The polo shirt I was wearing offered little protection. I winced but kept quiet because there were like three other people in the office. I told my co-worker later at lunch since we are pals and I had to share how I beat the odds and somehow injured myself with a Chromebook. He laughed but didn't tell the others, so I appreciate that. As for the nipple, it was inflamed for about a week.

This isn't the end of the story. Much time has passed and I all but forgot about my lesson of keeping rapidly closing devices at least a half foot from my manboobs. 

Well folks, lighting does strike twice. Only this time it was a Dell Latitude 5501 laptop and my right nipple. 

**TL;DR:** I (an overweight male) have inadvertently closed a lid of a laptop on both nipples on different occasions while on the clock in the span of two years.",733,1,1
Exempt Mr Bigshot,"Responded to an AskReddit with this story, and it was suggested it would fit in over here (fixed some formatting).

TL:DR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I work at my company's HQ. We support probably over a hundred users that have medium/high-profile articles written about them, plus their assistants &amp; interns.

For those unaware, Microsoft ended support for Windows 7 in January this year. For us folks in the industry, we knew well ahead of time and upgraded all machines to Windows 10 accordingly. I've been involved in W10 upgrade projects at other companies since 2017- across the board upgrading to Windows 10 has been **non-negotiable** once IT decides to make its move.

Current company decides at roughly the end of 2018 to start moving all remaining W7 machines to W10. Emails are sent to ALL employees, signed by CEO/CIO. This is coming from the top guys in our *entire industry*. We're having global IT meetings on Zoom every 2 weeks to discuss progress. Our office's remaining W7 numbers are going down- we're still sending emails every couple of weeks as a reminder to those who haven't switched that they need to coordinate with us to get it done.

  
Cue Mr. Bigshot who is *clearly* exempt. With 7 months to go, he starts emails my manager saying he can't move to W10 because his current setup is too specific, W10 is a PoS etc.  Manager replies stating this is non-negotiable, gives him the January deadline.

  
After he gets the next reminder email, Mr. Bigshot contacts his boss, says the same thing. Boss points out that the rest of their team has managed the switch, and that the top level of the company is asking this.

  
Next reminder, and he heads down to our in-house IT assistance and tells us he needs to speak to our manager and get exemption because, well, he's a Bigshot. Manager states exactly what was said in previous email.

  
We reach 2 months out. In our global IT meeting, we're told we can inform users their machines will be cut from the network if they don't make the switch. We're given the full backing from the top of the company to cut people off once January 14th 2020 hits.

Bigshot emails one of my coworkers to come up and speak to his admin. Admin explains Bigshot's exemption status. Coworker explains the cutoff threat.

  
It's the new year. Bigshot goes to the head of his department stating he is exempt. Dept. head asks CIO if there are exemptions. CIO is very clear.

  
It's Jan 14th, 2020. Coworker who spoke with Bigshot's admin pulls the plug. Bigshot's network access is gone. I'm at the in-house IT area. Bigshot's admin comes down and shows me the laptop, explaining he can't connect to the internet. I take one look at the machine, put on my ""I haven't heard that name in years"" face, and act super surprised that there's a computer still running W7, given how much of a security risk it is to the entire company, and that we've made IT's position very, VERY clear over the past 12 months. I tell her I HAVE to take the computer and upgrade it immediately. It's going to take the rest of the day and he'll get it back tomorrow. I call coworker over, and hand him the machine. Admin heads upstairs and explains to Bigshot.

Bigshot immediately complains to dept. head, who chastises him. Dept. head calls my manager to apologise, thank us for our patience, and gives us his full backing to do as needed with the machine.

  
I checked our ticket history yesterday- we haven't had a ticket from him in 9 months.

**TL:DR:** Bigshot thinks, despite numerous reminders for 12 months, that he's exempt from upgrading from Windows 7. Spoiler: &gt;!He isn't. Gets cutoff from company network.!&lt;",1289,0,1
Being asked to move tech to unprepared arieas.,"Ok for context I work for a school district and and am responsible for two elementaries. Both of them are currently under construction ex. network cabling not done, walls and drop ceilings torn apart, and power not run. One of the buildings is more complete than the other which is what I will be talking about here. (tech does not run network we have a vendor for this)

The main office is where the heavy construction is so the secretary and principle were moved to the music room. The building is getting a new music teacher and the principle wants me to move their setups back into the main office. Told her that if the construction is done I will be happy to do it

End of week comes and construction is still not done and still wants me to move tech. Once again told her that I could not since network is not run and there is no power. 

She bitches to my boss who sends out our network admin to setup a switch and pull the old network runs out of the ceiling crimp the cable. Switch wasn't even able to be powered. I set up the IP phone and left. 

I told her that I can not put a PC in this room if there is no power and will not be running extension cords since they will get in the way of construction. ""This is as far as I can go until construction is done.""

Music teacher is now coming the next day. Principle is now yelling at the workers running power to finish. Yelling at me to move tech even without power. 

I moved the secretary PC plugged everything in, laid the power cables on the desk, and left since my job was complete. Got a call from her about 5 minutes after I left for my other building bitching that the secretary couldn't use her desktop. Responded with ""Have her use her laptop that all staff members were supplied with until power is run."" 

Came back the next day and plugged everything in since power had been run. Now the secretary has the ability to sit next to workers actively drilling holes in concrete and the desk for cable runs. 

TLDR: Was told to move tech to an area under construction without power or network. Told them multiple times I can not. Got told to do it anyways so moved tech plugged everything in I could and left.",439,0,1
Windows Issues...,"This story didn’t happen to me but to one of my fellow techs at the Point of Sale company I worked for back in the 90’s.

We were selling these massive digital cash registers. I don’t know how much they weighed but they were quite heavy. They were getting to the long end of their product cycle but we were still selling them. You could program well over 500 items into them but you did so using hexadecimal. A real pain to do at best.

We had sold one of these to a winery in an old two storey wooden building. The owner of the winery was never really happy with them but one day he finally had had enough. 

We got a call from him. Short and sweet “I want you to come up here and pick up your f\*\*\*ing machine” (click).

So the tech drives up and immediately sees the problem. The tasting room cash register is not in the tasting room on the second floor. 

No. 

Its right below a broken window with one corner of it buried about 6 inches into the lawn.

These machines were such a bitch to use that a grown man had gotten so frustrated he picked up this HEAVY machine and threw it THROUGH a closed window. I had been frustrated by these machines before, but that’s next level stuff there.

The tech, not being paid to risk life and limb, just picked up the machine and loaded it into his truck, checked the cash drawer to see if it was empty (it was), and headed back to the barn. 

Management thought about sending the sales guy back up there to see if they could patch over things, but the last time I was up at that winery the tasting room sales were just being given hand written receipts and the cash being put in a tin box. 

Imagine that, a computer problem so bad that it makes the correct solution to be going back not one but two generations of technology.",312,0,1
That's now how you request support,"Let me set the scene. I'm onsite at a smaller site we only visit when we need to.

I'm doing an install of new hardware at the front reception desk. Karen (not her real name), the office manager is in her office with the door open.

Karen (loudly and in an angry tone): ""I am about to throw this bloody computer out the window"".

Me thinking this is just her being frustrated, just ignore it and carry on doing what I am doing.

Karen: ""Hello!? speddie23? Did you hear me? I said, I am about to throw this bloody computer out the window"".

This is her asking for help/support of some sort. Usually I would have no problems quickly helping someone out whilst I'm onsite, but not when someone has an attitude like this.

Me: ""Sorry Karen, I'm here for a specific task. You'll need to call the service desk.""

The Cisco 7200VXR from HELL," Years ago, I was a network/sysadmin in the army.   I controlled, managed  and administrated a LAN/WAN configuration. My  connection went to the next higher level in the scheme of things.  My  core router connected to another router that was owned and managed by  the next higher level (both were in the room). Their gateway router was a  Cisco 7200VXR (Cisco should've been crucified for making such a shitty  router). 

This is the story of when the 7200 had a complete hardware failure..

It happened on a Friday towards the end of the day. After trouble shooting the connection, I picked up the phone and called the NOC..

Me- This is SGT Bilkco from (location). There appears to be an issue with your 7200VXR in the rack.

NOC- Hold one, we'll jump into it and see what's going on.

NOC- er- there's seems to be an issue, we can't get into it (no shit).

Me- can you ping or trace route to it?

NOC- No. Your side is not responding to anything. We need to call Cisco support.

Me- That's fine.

(three way call. NOC, ME, Cisco support {CS})

Cisco determines that the problem is a failed motherboard.

CS- we need your credit card to secure a new motherboard.

Me- Why do  you need a credit card??

CS- To ensure the dead motherboard comes back.

Me- Listen here. We bought over 2 million dollars in new cisco equipment last year, I have a maintenance contract and a paid cisco partnership account. And you're giving me a hard time over a credit card???

CS- please hold. (CS goes silence and it's just me and the NOC now)

ME- WTF??! We spend a shit pot of money on Cisco equipment and now we're jacked around over a credit card???

NOC- yeah, makes you wonder.

Me- After this shit show is over, we're going 100% FOUNDRY EQUIPMENT!  CISCO CAN GO FUCK THEMSELVES!! I'M NOT BLOWING TAXPAYER MONEY ON SHITTY EQUIPMENT!!

(as soon as I threw this tirade out, CS comes back on the line instantly)

CS- SGT Bilko, we do not need a credit card to ship! We see you have a maintenance contract! The closest one is in Sydney! We'll overnight air! It will be there tomorrow morning!  

Me- Thank you.

CS- I think this ticket can be considered closed. Thank you for choosing Cisco, have a good day (click)

NOC- Good job on getting Cisco to blink.

Me- I hate paying for shitty service, That's what he was offering until I got mad. Notice his demeanor changed after I said we were going to move to Foundry? He was listening to see which way this call was going to go. 

NOC- Yep. Cool. I think we're done for the night. (it was going on 2100hrs by this time) Call us tomorrow and we'll get this issue finished.

Me- thanks! Have a good evening..

Sure as shit, the new motherboard arrived at the security desk via UPS the next morning. We had it installed and configured within 2 hours.",229,0,1
Let me transfer you....,"Today I put my foot in my mouth by learning the hard way that the application we use for phone calls in a call center, called Avaya One-X, does not keep a call on hold until a manual transfer occurs.....it takes the first call off of hold as soon as the second line answers. 

Normally this isn't a problem for a majority of situations. I am tier 2 technical support in my company. Tier 1 should have handled this call to begin with. It is ludicrous that it made it to tier 2.

The agent I was damned to have the pleasure of receiving their call ""didn't want to read the directions to set up her work from home machine - she wasn't that type of learner"" (her words not mine) and wanted me to talk her through it. 

I also learned that vocal intonation really does matter. Especially when someone can hear everything you were saying about the problem, but also somewhat about them.....

"""But, Its wireless!""","Hi!
Background information:
I work at a huge ISP with 14k+ in the personel-pool. In this job im in constant contact with everything from MDU-massmarket to third line/Hardware techs etc.

My role isnt very special but doing a dilligent job i weave a net of contacts for future issues and to get a better grasp of things (i hate to leave issues un-resolved).

Some cases are harder than others... Truly! You sometimes get calls from people with MIT degrees and sometimes you get... these calls: (EC = EntitledCustomer, M = me)

Some more branch term clarification:
MDU: Multi dwelling unit. This is in contrast with SDU Single dwelling unit.

Rgw: Residential Gateway (typically a router)

STB: Set top box (a digital TV box)

VLAN/multicast: technologies used to divide the network into several working parts without needing dedicated cables for things like dedicated TV or internet signals.

Case:
&gt;M""Hello and welcome to company X, how may i help you?""

&gt;EC: ""Yeah, as if you can. My internet isnt working, as usual! Your company sucks...""

&gt;M: ""I understand your frustration, what seems to be the issue?"" (Its always best to try and make the caller feel welcome)

&gt;EC: ""Well, i ordered this wifi from you a WEEK ago and its still not working!""

&gt;M: ""I see"" 

The service we sold to EC was a fiber connection, not ""wifi"". Arguing rarely helps however. I went over EC's connection information as seen by our order-dept. as well as starting a normal branch standard check against her hardware (CPE, Customer placed equipment. Basically the first item inside of MDU/SDU (Apartments/villas) and a VITAL part of getting your fiber connection going).

The order systems showed that everything was in the clear but the CPE check didnt... Realising something was amiss i asked EC to clairfy some things for me:
&gt;M:"" Thank you for holding. EC, i can see that the order connection time Has passed and that the connection should be...""

&gt;EC: ""NO! ITS NOT WORKING!""

&gt;M: ""As i tried to ask you, how is the CPE connected to your router/wall?""

&gt;EC: ""How should I know?! Im  not a tech expert! I've bought your services and they dont work! I DEMAND COMPENSATION!""
(This is so common its basically our version of karens ""i demand to speak to your manager"" sort of shit).

&gt;M: ""I understand that you're not happy and all i want to do is to help you rectify this issue. I can send a technician to your home but not for free unless we do a couple of basic fault-checks first. Does that sound ok?""

&gt;EC: ""Well... I guess. What do you want to know? And im not paying for it!""

&gt;M: ""Well, if you take a look at your CPE, a white/grey box on your wall, what does it look like?""

&gt;EC started a tirade about not being a sys admin or hacker or whatever, just imagine all the stupid things you might expect her to say and she probably said it. Getting her to calm down i tried once more after having given her the ultimatum: Either help me help you or i will have to hang up due to it being a non-productive call (Yes, we do have the right to do that! Its amazing &lt;3 ).

&gt;M: ""Can you tell me what lights are shining on the CPE you've located?""

&gt;EC: ""Lights? There are no lights.""

Starting to understand the issue at hand i ask:
&gt;M: ""Ec, you DO have a power cabel connected to the CPE, dont you?""

&gt;EC: ""What, it needs power? But its supposed to be wireless!""

Trying not to laugh or sigh too hard:
&gt;M: ""Well, the Router will give you a wifi connection but the CPE and Router both needs power to work."" (There are CPE's which can act as a router and send out a wifi signal, true, but none that we supply or allow).

&gt;EC: ""Oh, i unplugged the power cabel and put it in a cabinet since i didnt know what it was for.""

You have NO idea how hard i had to fight my urge to just laugh out loud at this. Especially after the fact that she asked me if i thought she was stupid and i HAD TO SAY NO! 

Case closed. It took me 45 minutes to solve an issue that would have taken 10 if she had just stopped rambling and given me the information. And no, she did NOT get any kind of conpensation for her time or the ""delayed connection"".",181,0,1
The dog (tech) ate (deleted) my homework,"So to help put myself through college, I worked as a Level I (and eventually Level II) tech for my university's on-campus, school-run tech support.  We were open from 12pm to 12am M-S, to accommodate college hours.

Most of the time, the jobs were pretty boring. Installing student printers in dorms, restocking the paper for the print labs, and the occasional 'I spilled 'water' on m computer and I have an paper due tomorrow, I need you to save my paper!!'

There's only one instance where I got suspended without pay.

Student walks in with some type of Windows PC and has a ton of viruses, no judgment on where he got them from. I decided the easiest thing to do would be to wipe the drive, reinstall Windows from scratch, and restore the files.  


Other issue is is the student came in at 11:58pm with a paper due that week. Not a problem, it isn't like the drive is toast - just enough viruses and trojanware to make doing any work impossible. But 2 minutes before close, I'm not sticking around to deal with this.  


This was a few years so we didn't have an online ticket system, everything was paper. On the check in ticket, we have a 'description of problem' box we fill out, and then a checklist of common issues: Backup Files, Wipe Drive, Reinstall OS, Restore Data, etc.  


It's late and I want to head home but tell the guy the tech that open the next day will be able to fix this no problem. I write ""wipe + restore data"" on the description, and check off the BACK UP FILES, WIPE DRIVE, REINSTALL OS, and RESTORE DATA checkboxes.   


I get a call the next day that I need to come in, immediately.  


The tech that opened the shop next day saw my ticket of ""wipe + restore data"", proceeded to wipe the drive, and then realized after the wipe that none of the data was backed up. The student lost their entire semester's worth of papers, including ones for exams that week.  


I was the ranking tech and the person who had written that tech, so my ass was the one that was sacrificed. My manager had to email the dean of students and every professor the student had a class with to explain the situation and request a continuance for the student, as most of the professors didn't believe our on-campus tech support would delete a student's paper.  


I now work in computer/data science and make sure whenever I check my work laptop in to my company's tech support that the ticket is filled out as detailed as possible. Oops.",140,0,1
I don't want an extra layer of security!,"Reposting this because it was removed for not containing story. I'm adding on a story of just one of these interactions.

For context, I work for an MSP with numerous support contracts. I am part of a team that is contracted to work onsite indefinitely at a large university, in their staff ICT support. They have their own in-house student ICT support.\[University\] has been rolling out a new Multi-Factor Authentication \[MFA\] system, due to some past cyber attacks (Read: Phishing, and dumb staff members that freely gave out their passwords). It's pretty simple, register on our web portal, and it links with the \[MFA\] app on your phone, or a rolling code hardware token if you don't have a compatible mobile. 

\*ETA\* I had forgotten to mention how the app works. YOu have the option of a push notification, which has accept or deny options on it, or, there's TOPT codes on the app, that refresh every 30 or so seconds. The hardware token is a OTP system as well, but it only generates and displays a code when you press the button on it.

I was in the test group, and have been enrolled in \[MFA\] since it's initial deployment. I have never had any issues. Now, this has not been mandatory yet, but heavy recommended. We've had quite a few staff enroll, with minimal issues. Some hiccups here and there, but that's to be expected. Now, recently, there's been some emails going out to all staff with information surrounding \[MFA\] including links to articles on what it's about, and how to enroll. You see, we're making it mandatory in a few weeks (With some exceptions on a case-by-case basis, but the staff don't know that).

Cue the influx of staff calling the service desk:

""Are these emails legitimate? It looks like spam""

""What exactly is \[MFA\]? Why do I need it""

""How do I enroll in \[MFA\]?""""I don't have a smart phone""  

""My phone is too old/not compatible""

""This adds an extra step into my routine, it's so inconvenient!""

""I enrolled in \[MFA\], now \[Completely unrelated system\] is not working! It's all your fault""

&amp;#x200B;

Story time!

Here's one particular interaction I had with a very... snobbish staff member. Not many people like dealing with this guy, as he comes off as an ""I know more than you"" type of person, and doesn't tolerate anyone who is not self-confident enough.

**SU** = Snobby user

**ME** = Well, me.

We had just finished rounding off a ticket where he reported a (legitimate) security concern he had regarding his account. Our primary recommendations were to change his password and enroll in \[MFA\]. He was not thrilled.

**SU:** So, as far as \[MFA\] is concerned, it will not work for me from home, because I have no cell signal. None. Zero. That will cause a major problem if I need to work from home.

**ME:** Well, you do not need to rely on cell signal, as it runs through a mobile app, which can run fine over WiFi, which you are using for your laptop at home.

**SU:** Oh. I had not considered that an app is required. To be honest, I do not trust most apps for security and stability reasons. What are the OS version limits?

**ME:** *\*gives version compatibility limits\**

**SU:** Well, I only have \[OS version lower than the minimum required, which is 4 years old\]

**ME:** Since your device is not compatible, we will need to issue you a hardware token *\*Gives detailed info on how these work\**

**SU:** I assume the dongle will be USB-C? (User has a laptop that only has USB-C ports). Do I need to switch the dongle to whatever computer I am using? Say, for example, I am in a hotel lobby in \[Country on the other side of the world\], can I use this same dongle?

**ME:** This token is not a dongle. It is a self-contained device that generates a code when you press the button, which you then enter into the prompt on your computer.

**SU:** Ah, I've seen these before. They use Bluetooth, correct?

**ME:** No, they do not have any connection of any kind to any other device. They are fully self-contained. They have a button, and a screen which displays the code.

**SU:** Okay, one last question. What happens if the battery runs flat? Say I am overseas, about to go into a meeting, and it is 3am \[local time of University\]. How can I get access when no code is generated?

**ME:** Unfortunately, these are sealed units with un-replaceable batteries. The battery, however, is designed to last 5-7 years with average usage. If you are concerned that it will run dry, you can replace it, say, every 3-4 years.

**SU:** Okay, so there's no guarantee it won't fail, and there's no warning before it fails. The takeaway from this is that I will not enroll in \[MFA\]. Thank you. *\*Reminder, \[MFA\] will become mandatory\**

I promptly sent that ticket over to my team lead, as I was sure there would be a complaint incoming, and was told not to worry about it. My team lead told me I had the patience of a saint in answering his questions, even he wouldn't have been able to make it that far.

The General's Laptop..," Note- I promise to not make any snarky comments about the ""children"" and their melt-downs.

 This  happened in 2002-2003 time frame. There I was.. A Army systems  admin wearing many hats. Knee deep in green-bar print outs, Windows 95  floppy disks, old Cisco network equipment and balls of CAT-5 cable.   (sorry.. no brass, no ammo in this story.   Yep. Some brass, like the  officer kind AGAIN) 

I got a special request once. The general wants to move from a desktop to a laptop. He wants everything to be EXACTLY the way it was on his desktop, to include how his files are laid out, the background, etc. Keywords to this (3 times) EXACTLY. 

I was given the laptop. I took it from bare bones to standard and added it to the network. I then copied (remotely) everything from his desktop to his laptop and arranged it EXACTLY as it was on his desktop. This was before CAC card days. How to ensure it was EXACT? Easy, change the general's password and login as him (with his permission). Logged into his desktop remotely and his laptop sitting on my bench at the same time and arrange everything so it was mirrored perfectly. The job was done it was EXACTLY as he wanted it. I was getting ready to take it over when...

The little brown nosing boss decided HE needed to take it over and set it up for the general.  I told him this was a General-to-Bilko project with no deviations. (warning- inbound shit show)

Two hours later..  My phone rings..

(little boss = LB)

Me- Networking, SGT Bilko speaking.

LB- I'm here in the general's office and this laptop is not working!

Me- It worked when it was on my bench, what did you do?

LB- I plugged it in and there is no networking!

Me- (knowing the general's office and knowing the jacks behind the typewriter desk were the original CAT3 phone wire from when the building was built) Where did you plug the network cable in at....?

LB- behind the typewriter desk!

Me- and you did not use the patch cable that was there for the desktop that was plugged into another jack...?

LB- No! I cut that one up and threw it in the trash.

Me- (banging head against hard flat surface) OK. I'll be over to make a new patch cable and we'll get this done.

I head to the general's office. The general is pissed. He gave this job to me, but little boss decided he would look awesome by taking it over and setting it up. He's pissed that a major wasted 2 hours of his time.

I make a new patch cable and started to plug it into the correct jack....

LB- I don't want to use that jack, I want the one behind the typewriter desk.

Me- it's CAT3 phone wire. It was never intended to be a network jack.

LB- I want it re-wired right now!

Me- Oooook. Let me get the ladders, a spool of CAT5 and pop the ceiling tiles in the CSM's office and 3  COL's offices to get to the signal closet. This is going to take a couple hours.

LB- NO! I want it done right NOW!

Me- No. This is a 2-3 hour job. You need to go to each affected office and let them know I'll be moving ceiling tiles and they'll need to leave.

LB- NO! I want it done now!

Me- (to LB) OK. You have a choice- 2-3hrs of ceiling tiles or this patch cable. What's it going to be?

General- Patch cable. Get it hooked up and get out. 

(LB leaves)

I plugged in the cable, had networking, showed the general his layout and had him change his password.  I apologized to the general for the actions of my little boss.

General- No, you did exactly as you were asked to do. Your boss hijacked this to earn browny points. Thank you.",2039,0,1
Who's phone number is that?,"This is only a short one, but I hope you like it regardless. About a year ago I was working in a local government office. In my role I gave some ad-hoc tech support.

I got a call from $lawyer saying they couldn't log in to their M365 account from home. They would get to the screen asking for a code, but they wouldn't get one. When they were next in the building, I stopped by their office and took a look.

$me: Ok so it says they've sent you a code now, can you have a look on your phone?

The lawyer showed me their phone, and sure enough they hadn't gotten any codes. I looked at the screen, and it said the code was sent to a number ending in XXX.


$me: That's weird, does your phone number end in XXX?

$lawyer: No, it ends with ZZZ

$me: Then whose phone number is that?

$lawer: I don't know


The office has admin support staff that assisted the lawyers. I went to their team leader to ask who the phone number belonged to. It turned out $admin, who had left a couple months earlier, had the bright idea to set up $lawyers MFA with their phone number. $team_leader was able to call $admin, and have them relay the security code so we could change the phone number for the MFA.",262,0,1
I Want YOU to fix it,"my first post on this sub.... short and sweet.


I was on the network support team at a retail giant in Canada.  
A ticket came into our queue about an unreachable server issue.     I checked the network and all connectivity was there, so I updated the ticket indicating the network checks out, that the issue requires server support, and then pushed the ticket to the server support queue.   

Big mistake.      


15 minutes later I had an angry VP yelling at me on the phone, telling me that I'm extremely unprofessional, and he will personally speak to my director about my work ethic.  He told me that the ticket will be reassigned to me, and said ""I want YOU to fix it"".    

I laughed, explained what a network was, and what a server was.    He didn't want to hear it and demanded that I fix the issues.  I told him that I don't have a magical wand that fixes problems that I have no visibility to.       Next thing I know, my manager is involved, re-explaining why this wasn't a network issue, which finally calmed down the VP.   

I didn't get fired, just told that I shouldn't laugh at VPs no matter how dumb they are.",1172,0,1
The Noise,"As I pull into the parking lot on this crisp autumn morning I see a class out on the playground having just the best time ever. I thought it was kind of weird because this isn't anywhere close to any recess times and they sure haven't earned any extra recesses yet this year. Not that it really matters to me, but I just thought it was a bit weird as I was pulling into my parking spot.

I walk in the door and the first thing that greets me is Titanium Trevor. Titanium Trevor is the school resource officer that is literally half titanium alloy or aluminum at this point due to an absurd number of surgeries he's had - a brisk walk would outpace his run. Even more unfortunate is that he is wildly inappropriate and cannot take a hint. I'd honestly rather suck-start a shotgun than listen to another word he says. So of course he's in the lobby to greet me and says ""man you're starting off with a good mornin' aren't ya?""

""Every morning is a good morning, Trevor."" I reply as I brush him off to quickly punch in at the time clock.

""They say it's one of your wires coming out of that ceiling that's making the noise""

""Who is they and what wire and what noise?""

""Oh, didn't they call you?""

""No?""

""Well apparently there's one of your wires in Harris's room that's making some loud noise or somethin'.""

""...what wire of mine could POSSIBLY be making noise?""

""I don't know man that's just what they said.""

""Who is they???""

""Harris I guess. Brother I don't know I'm just tellin' ya what they told me.""

""Fine. Let me set my stuff down first.""

We walk down there and sure enough there's a pretty loud noise. It sounds like one of the bells on the intercom system got stuck in the ""on"" position.. except it's not coming from the intercom. It's coming from the opposite side of the room. The same side of the room as ""the wire"".

My first and really only mistake was listening to them instead of just doing my own investigation. I begin looking where they said it was coming from (the rapid run audio/video cable that you use connect a DVD player up to the projector). Yeah, it's a bit louder in that area, but there's no way in hell it's making this loud of a sound.

I get my sciatic-nerve-on-fire-half-my-leg-and-foot-numb self on a table because Titanium Trevor is just standing there completely uselessly. I begin to pop open a couple ceiling tiles and determine that the noise is for sure not coming from ""the wire"" nor the ceiling. I begin to think that it's a bit louder by some wall powered microscopes (this is in a science classroom) they have set up on a table so I start unplugging anything in the area and the noise just isn't going away.

I tell Titanium Trevor to just stay here (basically keep doing what he's already doing so expertly) and that I'm going to start flipping breakers to see if we have some insane interference being caused by God knows what. I flip all the breakers for that room and it's still as loud as ever. I limp back down there and begin to just listen.

As I'm just using my ears to navigate (much like Bird Box) I'm cancelling out the incredible echoes of the noise and Titanium Trevor's incessant rambling. I'm honing in on the target. But as I dial myself in I begin to feel an overwhelming wave of regret. I know what's happening. I did this to myself. I'm becoming self aware - self aware of the fact that I assumed that they knew what they were talking about.

I listen. I listen hard. I divert all non-critical sensory input to my ears. Taste? Not important. Smell? Not important. Touch? Maybe. I'll leave a small reserve in that tank. After channeling and redirecting my sensory abilities I'm being driven toward the ground. It's low. Is it one of those prank noise makers? Did a kid pull a genius stunt to get a free 30 minute recess? I begin to check under tables. The first table isn't right, the noise isn't loud enough. The second table nearby is loud. I mean LOUD. But it isn't coming from the underside of the table. It's even lower than that. It's coming from the ground where all the... backpacks... are... The blue backpack on the ground. It's coming from the blue backpack. I pick it up and the noise follows the backpack upward. It's inside.

I don't know if I'm allowed to go through a child's belongings so Titanium Trevor does the only useful thing he's done all morning and opens the backpack up. The noise is infinitely louder. He begins taking things out one by one until finally... the metronome. It's a band kid's metronome. It's a kid's metronome that they evacuated the classroom for. It's a kid's metronome that was the cause of the class being out on the playground as I pulled into the parking lot. It's a metronome that they blamed on ""my"" wire. It's a metronome that neither the 30 kids, nor the teacher, nor any other adult at the school bothered to put in any effort to find. 

They lost an entire class period's worth of learning over a metronome, in a child's backpack, that had nothing to do with the Technology Department.",179,0,1
But the power adapters looked the same....,"I was at our panel beaters the other day when he asked if I could look at the DVR for his CCTV cameras as it wasn't recording. Unit was powered up and displaying everything fine, could be accessed remotely, but couldn't find the HDD. They'd bought another DVR thinking the original one was faulty, but still the same issue. So I got both DVRs and tried them, swapped HDDs etc but no go. Then I realized I hadn't heard the drives spin up.  

Hmmm maybe a crook drive had gone dead short and fried something in both DVRs? Cracked out the multimeter and measured voltages on the SATA power lead. 5VDC, and ~~12VDC~~ 8.35VDC. Thats not right! Swapped the power plug onto the other DVR, same result. Lightbulb went on. Unplugged and checked the voltage directly at the jack from the power pack, 8.35VDC. Checked the voltage rating, 8.4VDC.  

Climbed down and had a chat with them. Turns out they'd come in one morning and found the DVR dead, no lights etc so they swapped the power pack for one that had **physically** identical specs but different voltage rating. When they got the new DVR they just plugged all the old stuff into the new DVR so it had the same issue. The way it was packaged, all the cords etc were hidden in the box. 

He'd meant to go and get a replacement power supply but the country went into lockdown and he'd forgotten until I asked.",566,0,1
"Explinaing simple concepts to the ""Boss""","So a few comment's on another post jogged my memory on this one.  
I'll preface by saying probably not the most interesting story but thought It could potentially open a can of worms with some other peoples experiences of ""higher ups"" not grasping relatively simple concepts.  


The company I was working for at the time had added a new division installing AV equipment and interactive whiteboards. They had a dedicated install's team. but because their biggest contract was in the area I covered as an IT field engineer a lot of the maintenance fell to me. Essentially I went from spending most of my time on client sites  dealing with malware infested desktops &amp; jammed printers to changing bulbs in projectors...  


This particular day I was out with one of the guys from the installs team and the two of us were doing a maintenance visit to a high school.   


1. Go into class room 
2. Asset tag the whiteboard and projector &amp; note down serial numbers 
3. Clean the projectors air filter
4. Note the lamp hours
5. Clean the board  (Wipe down with a baby wipe)
6. If the image poorly aligned do our best to fix that

Split up - rinse and repeat until we run out of class rooms, baby wipes or asset tags...  


Some point during the day the relatively newly appointed head of installations, (Not my boss and if i remember correctly an electrician to trade) arrived on site just to see how we were getting on (Think we were about 60 miles from the office)  He cam into the room i was working in just as I was finishing realigning the projector.  The image on the screen is now perfectly aligned top and bottom with about a 1"" gap at the left and right edges of the screen.   


IM = installs manager  
ME = really? 

IM: ""Can you not fix those gaps at the sides? that doesn't look very good"" 

ME: ""No. its the aspect ratio of the projector...""

IM: cutting me off - ""What ?""

ME: ""If i extend the image so the gaps aren't at the sides it will be off the top or bottom of the board. Think of it like when your watching something in widescreen on the telly and its in the letterbox in the middle of the screen""

IM: ""Oh right aye.""

I turn off the projector, pick up my tools and start heading for the door  


IM: So are you not going to fix those gaps

ME: Eyerolling internally ""No. like I said it cant be done, at least not without getting a new projector""

IM: walks off

"""What part of 'I'm calling CID and having you arrested' did you not understand?"""," Note- This would have been posted at [r/MilitaryStories](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/), but politics got in the way.

This  happened in 2002-2003 time frame. There I was.. A Army systems admin wearing many hats. Knee deep in green-bar print outs, Windows 95 floppy disks, old Cisco network equipment and balls of CAT-5 cable.  (sorry.. no brass, no ammo in this story.   Yep. Some brass, like the officer kind AGAIN)

The help desk gets a call from a remote installation, they unsure how to fulfill the request, so they passed it over to me.  This was an interesting conversation that deals with network ownership and who is responsible for it. Our officer of the day is Major MCP (microsoft certified professional). He held an MCP at the time, but did not hold signal branch or assigned a billet in the IT field.

me- Networking, SGT Bilko speaking.

MCP- This is Major MCP. I was passed over to you from the help desk to get something resolved.

me- Sure sir, what do you need help with?

MCP- I need the IP scope of my building so I can configure and install a linksys wireless router.

me-  That's not happening.

MCP- why not? It's my building, I can do what I want with it. Besides, I'm a MCP.

me- Ok sir.. Let me help you out. First off, the network is my responsibility; not yours. Second, this is a DOD network, we don't install wireless routers because you want one (at the time, there were NO wireless networking of any kind). To install one would be considered a breach of security.

MCP- I know what I'm doing, I'm an MCP. What are you? Just a lowly E5? You need to hand over the IP information so I can get this wireless router installed. I'm an officer, you're just a peon enlisted. You do what I order. (DOH! he really stepped in that one!)

me- OK sir. I guess breach of a DOD network went over the top of your head. Should I put you on hold and call CID (Criminal Investigation Division) to have you arrested now, or later? Your choice.  BTW- I OWN this network, you do not.  I don't give two sh!ts if you're an MCP or not. You are a guest on my network, I don't work for you, nor are you part of my chain of command. What you are ordering is illegal and a felony. Better yet! Let me call CID and I'll drive down with them and I'll camcorder your arrest! 

MCP- You can't talk to me that way! I want your boss on the phone!

me- Sure thing sir. (put the turd on hold, walk into the boss's office and explain to him what the call is about before forwarding it)

(Boss conversation in the background. CID, felony, illegal and ""I don't care if you're a MCP"" came up several times in that conversation)

Boss- I can't believe that idiot!

me- it takes all sorts, sir. Do I need to call CID?

Boss- No. I told him if you find any router or rogue device of any kind on their subnet, that you will be taking their subnet offline until a team can be sent down there to ensure there are no other rogue devices on that subnet.

me- thank you sir!

The Phantom Terminal,"Caveat:  English is my first language, so I have no excuse.  Enjoy the charm of bizarre syntax.

Once upon a time (I have to start this way since it harkens back into the mists of computerology) there was an organization that brought up a new system, a very complex system with tons of data.  It provided a new way of putting more information into the system as well as retrieving needed information.  

This was a mainframe-based system with a single location on the continent.  On this continent were I-forget-how-many offices that were served, but it was at least in the mid-hundreds, and each office had multiple users.  So, thousands of terminals.  

You might imagine what it takes to purchase and install thousands of terminals as simultaneously as possible.  Not to mention training the staff which uses them on the system and software that they need.  These systems replaced an extremely complicated paper function that required sending lots of paper daily.  Believe me, as expensive a project as it was, it probably saved enough money in postage over five years to pay for itself.  

The goal, of course, was to put a terminal on the desk of every employee who **needed** one.  There were literally no spares at the time of initial installation.  

Cue a district office manager.  His function did not warrant a terminal, so there was not one placed upon his desk.  Fuss and bother resulted, but there was not a terminal to spare for him even if he could have used it, which he couldn’t.  He was way too busy to learn how.  Not to mention that his function did not require directly accessed information or the ability to enter information into the system.  Of course.  

Fuss and bother escalates but does not cause another terminal to magically appear.  Manager has furrowed brow.  Techs are getting surly.  The system comes up continent-wide and magically works.  (The number of virgins sacrificed to make this possible I am loathe to admit.)  Manager now has extremely high blood pressure but does not physically explode like people are hoping.  

Something had to be done, and one person finally came up with a solution.  

They still had no terminals to spare, but they had an older terminal from a prior decade that had a crt but no other innards.  They polished this one up and, waiting until a day when manager was not in the office, delivered it to his office together with a keyboard.  They figured it was going to be a while before manager tried to use it and discovered it did not even turn on, much less work.  Maybe by that time they would have spares to substitute for terminals in for repair, and they could finally give him one of those.  

Manager returns to office and finds his tantrums have finally resulted in a terminal appearing on his desk.  Techs wait and wait for his call that it did not work.  Years pass, manager retires, and no call was ever made.  

A clear win for minimalist tech support.",1327,1,1
Self-confident customer steals my time with an actually small mistake.,"**Long story short:** customer was too self-confident to see his mistake and therefore gave relevant information too late.

&amp;#x200B;

I manage the complaints department of a manufacturer of engine components. Part of my job is to check components, write reports and look after customers over the phone.

A customer called that an electrical component on his turbocharger did not respond. These turbochargers are mostly remanufactured parts. Small mistakes can creep in, but they are rare. It is even rarer that the error occurs 3 times.

According to his item number, I sent him the electrical part individually.

Two days later he reports that he had got the wrong part, the plug would be a bit different. It came out that he had a different part number than indicated. Again sent out the component with the other connector.

Two days later he reports again, the connector fits, but the component does not respond. He sends a picture of the old part that was originally installed. It's a completely different one! Find the original part number with the VIN. The customer needs a completely different turbocharger, all parts and the charger work, just not in his vehicle.

Customer says he has the part number from website x because website y is too complicated and often swaps numbers. Side x is the only side that swapped the numbers in this case.  
(Edit: The car manufacturer gives a part an original part number. Then comes the aftermarket and produces spare parts with their own numbers. And there are many websites to link those numbers. And some swap some numbers )

8 days of troubleshooting over the phone without technical errors, like there wasn't enough to do.

Nobody pressed the button,"[u/dhgaut's story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ixqwa1/assuming_the_user_knows_something_is_a_mistake/) reminded me of one I experienced, not with lies but with general uselessness.

I've written this before as a comment, but as far as I can tell never as an actual post.  I used to be a local tech for a copy/print/ship company, the one with an arrow in their logo.  This takes place a little more than a decade ago, I was assigned an area in Downtown Los Angeles and covered multiple stores in the area.  One Friday afternoon my boss calls me while I'm at my main office in the middle of Downtown LA.

&gt; Boss:  ""Hey what's your schedule look like?  I may need your help at [not your location], they're having a network issue.

&gt; Me:  ""Nothing really.  What's going on?""

&gt; Boss:  ""[not your location] has an issue where all their computers connected to [VLAN] are down.  I told the manager to call the help desk and get a ticket opened but he hasn't done it yet and I'm not doing anything until he does what I told him to do.""

Time passes and I send a few emails to my boss asking for an update because traffic starts to suck at around 3.  It would take me anywhere from 1.5 hours to 2 hours to get home and [not my location] was double the distance past my home.  Finally close to 4 my boss calls me.

&gt; Boss:  ""OK they got a ticket finally and I'm pretty sure I know what the problem is.  They're just refusing to follow my directions.  The switch for [VLAN] needs to be rebooted and they won't do it.""

&gt; Me:  ""Are you approving overtime?  It's going to take me hours just to drive out there.""

&gt; Boss:  ""No, go first thing Monday.  Their fault for not listening to me and refusing to do a simple task.""

Back then the stores had 4 separate VLAN's, each running on its own switch.  Except for [VLAN], if you were an older store they repurposed a 3com 10base hub which originally had been the only network device for the whole store (installed somewhere between Fall 1997 and Spring 1998).

Monday I drive out to [not my location] and arrive around 9am.  They've got a barricade of trash cans blocking the area where customers can use computers, which all are on [VLAN].  I go introduce myself to the Assistant Manager and she gets the key to the network closet.  Their network closet was a decent sized room, three 2-post racks with the switches all mounted in the center one.

I don't even need to flip on the lights to see all 24 lights on the 3com are solid.  No flashing, solid LED lights, this location does not have 24 devices plugged in so at least half of those should be off.  I turn on the lights, walk around the racks, go to the back of the hub and press the red reset button next to the power cable.  I walk back around and see the hub power cycling, hear the fans spinning up and then the lights start flashing for the ports that have devices plugged in.

I go back out and check the computers, sure enough everything is starting to pop back online.  I go over to the Assistant Manager and let her know everything is fixed.  She asks me to show her what I did so I walk her back to the network room and show her the button I pressed.

&gt; Assistant Manager:  ""That's it?  That's all someone had to do to fix it?""

&gt; Me:  ""Yes, that's the reset button.  It just needed a reset.  Someone could've unplugged the power cord and plugged it back in to fix it too.""

She started laughing and let me know that when she left on Friday afternoon the manager was handling it and he told everyone to not touch anything.

Close it when you are done.,"I was home for the holidays a few years back when my mom mentioned that the internet on her work phone seemed to be a bit slow. She worked for her state government and they had just switched everyone off of blackberries for the first time. 

I went to check her phone and found 34 open internet tabs. I asked her if she really needed all those and she asked what a tab was! She had kept opening new tabs assuming that each time she did so the old one closed. I showed her how to close them and she sheepishly thanked me.

This is but one of MANY stories about this woman interacting with technology. We still make fun of her (in a friendly way) for the time she brought the chrome art device on a trip instead of her phone charger.",125,0,1
Assuming the user knows something is a mistake,"Back in the DSL days, I got a phone call from an office telling me that the network was down.  First thing to try is a power cycle on the modem because the modem was crap.  I was driving at the time, I could not be right over so I asked them to do it and they said fine.  An hour passes and they call to say now it's much worse, some people can't print or access the server.  I head straight over, grab the modem and, oh look, nothing was plugged in correctly. I tell them they were supposed to just power cycle and they said they didn't know which cable it was so they pulled them all out and then they didn't know which ones went where so they just made choices.",438,0,1
Where does the USB go?,"I do all the tech stuff for my parents business (my career is in engineering but I have a webdev/it background).  I live in another city several hours away from their business.  My parents and their staff are all very tech illiterate.

When a problem occurs, usually I can remote in and fix the issue.  However sometimes the issue is hardware related and I have to be onsite to fix it.  I don't want to drive 2 hours to fix a problem if I don't have to, so first I try to walk the staff through the troubleshooting over the phone.

Last week I get an emergency call saying the POS (point of sale) computer can't connect to the server (thus the pos software won't load).  (OH BOY, that sounds like a fun problem to solve! /s)  So I call up the staff and talk to one of the employees who gives me the run down.  I remote in and determine the router/modem is defective, then contact the ISP to get a tech out to replace it.  The tech can't come for a few days and without the POS software, the staff would be forced to write down all the sales (and enter them into the POS when the connection is back up).

The server is just a separate pc running windows and it is located in a secure location within the business.  To save the staff some time, I figure I'd have them locate the server pc, unplug it (only power and ethernet) and hook it up next to the main work station so they could access the POS software/db directly.  This ends up working fine and they are able to enter all the sales normally.

Eventually the tech comes in and replaces the modem.  So I call the staff and tell them to put the server back where they found it and rehook up the pos workstation.  Several hours pass and I haven't heard a response from them, so I assume that everything went well.

The next day I get a call that the mouse and keyboard don't work, but the workstation computer turns on/boots.  So I ask them if they reconnected all the cables.  None of the employees understand what I mean, so I get them to take a photo of the rear of the workstation with their cellphone.  Nothing but the monitor and power are plugged into the PC!  (And it turns out they didn't move the server until the end of the day, gave up trying to rehook up the workstation, then all went home.)

I call them and ask why they didn't hook up the rest of the cables (ethernet, multiple usb).  They tell me that they didn't know where those cables went and were afraid of making a mistake by plugging them into the wrong holes.  I kindly explain how to plug them in.  Everything works and I hang up.

So here I am wondering, how do they not know where the usb goes?  Have these people never used a usb before (ie. power their cellphone, use a usb memory card, etc)?  Certainly being tech illiterate doesn't mean you become brain dead when you see a piece of technology does it?

I think of that game toddlers play where they have a box with different shapes and have to stick the triangle in the triangle hole, the square in the square hole, etc.  Then I think of the staff - they look at the back of the computer - there are 6 rectangle usb slots and 1 square ethernet slot.  Should it not be simple to figure this out?

I have never worked in the IT/tech support field outside of this one job.  I can imagine how frustrating it can be trying to solve an issue where all you have is your phone to communicate and the person on the other end is tech illiterate.",1085,0,1
Tight Yorkshire man.,"For those who don't know, folks from Yorkshire have a reputation for being very careful with their money. By this time I was working on electron microscopes for a large Japanese company (still am in fact). Anyway, let's get to the story.

So I'm sitting in the office when a call comes in from a user of one of our machines. He had the same system for over 20 years and it was the only one of its kind in the UK. In all that time he had never had a service contract nor asked us to work on any issue. Fair enough; he was a competent user and had enough informed people around him to keep it running. Being a tightwad Yorkshireman he also objected to spending money on such fripperies as service contracts.

So the call starts off with him virtually demanding a replacement air valve for this ancient and unique machine. I promised to call him back after I had identified the part and located one. That set me off on a few hours of fruitless searching. Of course we didn't have the part ourselves so I took to calling around pneumatic suppliers all over the country. The usual reaction was laughter and disbelief that someone still used these old valves.

Finally one of these companies suggested replacing the entire valve block and manifold with modern equipment that matched the required specs. It seemed reasonable to me and they offered the whole kit at a very cheap price. I called him back and the convo went something like this.

Me ""I'm sorry Mr. X but these valves have been out of production for nearly 2 decades and we have none in our world wide stock. I've also called many suppliers and they also confirm nil stock.""

X ""Well what am I supposed to do? This is bloody terrible customer service"" . Says the man who hadn't spent a bent penny with us for 20 years.

Me ""We do have the option to replace entire valve bank with modern valves and it'll only cost 200 pounds""

X ""200 bloody quid! That's a bloody ripoff. I'll sort myself out thanks"" and hangs up.

I've no idea how he resolved it and frankly I don't give a bugger.",1156,0,1
Being “monitored”,"So this is going to be a funny post for some good humor/laugh.

Today at work, had a ticket for a user that was having a monitor issue. The user couldn’t get windows to recognize new monitor. I saw that the only two were working. One is the laptop lcd screen. They other two are external. I checked the cables and everything was good. I saw under the display settings that the new monitor was “disconnected”. I extended all screens and it worked. Issue resolved. 

The user had two older monitors that were made in 2012. These two monitors don’t have 1080p. So they aren’t very useful with the resolution.

I took each monitor back to our lab to be disposed later. As I was taking the last one, one of the security guards asked/said, “you know you’re being ‘monitored.’  I said, “yep.”",345,0,1

Prosecution presents into evidence exhibit A: bloddy glass and exhibit B: an ass print,"Yes, I know the title is misspelled... roast away

TL: DR at bottom

This story involves the same school district as my last story. This time it was the high school with the issue.

Think this was early 2010’s when this story happened. The office received a call Monday morning asking for a tech to come down and check a couple of machines that had been vandalized over the weekend. Apparently a couple teenagers broke into the one supply room and trashed a copier and a duplicator. Lucky me got the job.

I arrive and am shown the disaster zone. The duplicator was scrap, it got shoved down a winding stair case and was utterly destroyed. Looked like they went to each landing and kept kicking it down the stairs till it hit bottom, there was ink EVERYWHERE, thank God I didn’t have to clean that up but I do feel for the janitor that did. On to the copier, the document glass was broken, the control panel had had soda poured on it, orange judging by the color and smell, and the front cover/door was broken off. I proceed to pick all the glass out of the optics section, there was a couple pieces that had blood on it so I set those aside. I pulled the control panel off and took it all apart, cleaned all the contacts and switches, got all the stickiness off the panel and buttons, and then put it back on. I tricked the door actuator just to get the machine powered on to what all error codes showed up. Multiple jams throughout the machine so I go fishing, jams in the side, under the drum and one about three quarters of the way through the fuser. Now if you read the title I’m sure you all know what was on the print sitting in the fuser, I nice clear ass print. My guess is whoever broke the copier was making a copy of their butt and was hopping off the glass when the glass broke, cutting up their butt, the front cover got knocked open and broken off when they were getting off the machine. They probably poured soda on the controls thinking it’d kill the machine, again I’m just guessing. I toss the “evidence” into a clear paper protector to keep the bottom section from smearing toner and put the bloody glass in a zip lock bag and start closing up the machine to see what works if anything. Amazingly the copier still “worked” the start button worked but the touch panel and other sections were fried. You could put something in the document feeder and it would make a single copy of what you put in, the doc feeder uses a small strip of glass of to the side and it was still intact. And everything internally was fine other than needing a new front door/cover. I write up what all the machine needs and head to the office with evidence in tow.

M: Our intrepid tech who has seen way to many stupid things to be surprised by any of this
S: Secretary
P: Principal

M: Ok, good news and bad news. The duplicator is not even worth looking at but the copier is salvageable with some parts and TLC.

S: Oh good we were hoping it wouldn’t be a complete loss. The principal wanted to talk to you once you were done, let me get him.

About 5 minutes pass and the secretary shows me to the principals office

P: So what’s the situation, I’m going to need estimates on repairs. We think we know who did it but are still looking into it.

I explained what all was wrong with the copier and duplicator.

P: Ok, just estimate a whole new control panel, insurance will be coving it if we don’t catch who did it, but if we do their parents will be.

M: Ok, that won’t be a problem, I have some “evidence” that may help you figure out who did it.

P: Evidence?

I showed him the bloody glass and then the butt print.

P: Oh my God… Well that should help, I think… Thanks for taking a look at things, can you email me the estimate here and he handed me a business card.

M: Sure thing

After I got back to the shop I emailed the estimate and we got the go ahead within a couple of days to fix the copier. I got to go back and fix everything up about a two weeks later, had some interesting news when I got done with repairs and went to get paperwork signed.

M: Morning P, everything is all fixed up. How’d you make out with your investigation.

P: Oh it was quite interesting. We had a couple students in with their parents asking them questions. The kids were denying everything till I brought up the bloody glass and the butt print. The one boy’s parents immediately started yelling at him. I guess he lied and made up some excuse why he needed to have some stiches in his butt. His dad went ballistic and said he’d be paying for everything if he didn’t fess up and say who was all involved. Turns out it was the two other boys there and one other who didn’t get caught. The others confirmed and the parents ended up having to split the bill. I could hear the parents yelling on the way out that the kids were making up for every penny they had to pay for their stupidity.

M: Well I’m glad you caught who did it. You have a good day and thanks for the laugh.

Wish I could have been a fly on the wall when that all went down.

TL: DR – Some idiots high schoolers broke in to their school and broke some equipment. One of them broke the copier and cut his butt making copies and then had to get stiches. They got caught after the principal brought up the butt print and broken glass. Parents make them pay for damages.",969,0,1
Commodore 1541 won't write to half of the disk,"I wanted to type this up before everyone who knows what I am talking about is dead.

I once worked for a computer repair store that specialized in Commodore repair.  The Commodore 1541 was the 5-1/4"" floppy disk drive that worked with the Commodore 64.

A  customer came in and said he could only fill a disk half way and then it would stop working.  I thought this was strange and had him set it up so he could show me.

So he shows me and it seems he is correct.  What could be causing this?  Then he tried to take the disk out and it wouldn't pop out (Clue number 1!).  But he says this is how it works and you have to grab it with your fingernails.

Now the 1541 had an ejector mechanism with a spring that pushed the  disk out when you opened the door.  This had never worked for the customer, so he didn't know it was broken.

So I open up the drive and discover that the ejector mechanism was tangled up.  Not only did it not eject the disk, but it also lifted the disk head up halfway through its full range of motion!

I untwisted the mechanism and the ejector worked and he could use the whole disk.  I was so surprised to see this problem that I didn't charge the customer.",2177,0,1
It can't be a firewall issue if there is no firewall!,"This has been an ongoing issue for me for the past week and still in the quagmire of this. So my client ""Jane"" has requested our assistance as her company switches over software vendors for some specific machines. Normally this isn't too bad basically you go to each of these machines point where it needs to get/send data to the new  IP address and make sure the routes in place. Since Jane's company already has a working relationship with the vendor ""Dumbass Inc"" (DAI) really it was a matter of making the change on each of the devices. 

The day of the switch over comes and they are doing these phased as to not take everything down at the same time. They start working machine 1 and it fails to check in. Jane (who loves us and hates DAI with the firey passion i have not seen out side of someone who works directly in IT) calls me and requests a conference call wit DAI to see whats going on. I call in and it goes something like this:

Jane: So we have Tyr4774 here from our IT team to assist  
DAI-1: Yeah so we are able to see the device come on line, we can ping it and trace route to it but the connection fails. Do you think your firewall could be blocking traffic?  
Me: I don't think so, we only have a L3 switch for routing internally and there are no ACLs on that SVI. All traffic should flow to your directly connected router. According to the routing table the next hand off if you device at X.X.X.X  
DAI-2:No that can't be the case, our networking team assures me that everything has been configured properly for our side.   
Me: Look, our device is on X.X.X.123, and your router is at X.X.X.10. The Gateway is at .254 and it says the next hop for Y.Y.Y.Y is X.X.X.10. I'll take a packet capture and see.

\*Take packet capture on link that connects directly to X.X.X.10\*

Me: As you can see here the packet to Y.Y.Y.Y on port 12345 as you defined, leaves our equipment, we see no return traffic and the issue must lie within your network.  
DAI-2: Here let me get my ""Senior Network Engineer"" on the line to take a look.

By this time i'm beating my head against the wall. I've done these before and it has always been a configuration error on DAI's end. 

DAI-3:Looking over the configuration there doesn't appear to be anything configured incorrectly on our end, are you sure there is no firewall blocking the traffic on your end?

By this time Jane can practically hear my teeth grinding into the microphone and is sure i'm about to just start drinking while on this call. At this point she takes my evidence (a nice pcap file) and lets DAI know that she will send this data to her account rep on how they're losing money and that they may go back to their old vendor if DAI can't get this fixed.",803,0,1
I work at an free IT Support for our Students at a university and got my boss getting reported to the police,"So, this happened last year:

I work at a Service Point for Students (and am a student myself) where we fix pcs and problems of smaller nature for students of the university. One day we got a call from a woman called Mrs. O:

&amp;#x200B;

O: ""Hello?""

Me: ""Yeah, how can I help you?""

O: ""So i am a student at your university, and im currently at the office im working (some laywers office, nothing affiliated with the university). My pc isnt working, can someone of you can come and help me?""

Me: ""Im sorry, but these pcs are the issue of your laywer, and also we dont do visits or anything like that. Were students!""

O: ""BUT IM HAVING A PROBLEM WITH MY PC AND I AM A STUDENT! I study law at your university? Why wouldnt you help me? I have a sickness please...""

Me: ""Thats unfortunate, but we dont fix PC of companies. Thats their issue not ours. We only fix your own pc""

O: ""BUT THATS MY PC IM WORKING ON THERE""

Me:""Is it yours, or your companies""

O: ""Im using it!!!""

Me: (Already pissed off... Trying to cut down the talk) ""Miss, i will now hang up. It doesnt seem you understand what our service is for, and there are other people in line waiting for issues we are here to fix. Have a nice day

Check your calendar,"Hi, long time lurker, first time poster. 

English is not my first language sorry for any errors.

I'm working in a small company providing IT support to a whole lot of clients around our city. Very small to medium business, almost exclusively on mac.

The clients are, for the most part, nice. Except this client. It's a little client, not one with a maintenance contract. But he is so tech illiterate that it hurts. 

We had some trouble when he moved his business to another part of the city, and the isp couldn't find the fiber for his office. We finally managed to resolve the issue and he finally got internet after 2 month on 4g router. But since then he seems to be looking for any way to dump us. 

He calls every day for small idiotic problems, more idiotics than usual I mean. One day it's his VPN (didn't click ""connect""), the other it's a file on his server missing (moved it and doesn't know how to use search on Finder). And so on.

Come thursday when he calls about his calendar being missing and everything is our fault, nothing is working blablabla. I open TeamViewer (I saved is id), open calendar, check his name, behold his calendar is here, working as intended.

Keyboard not found - Press F1 to Resume,"Ok, this was back in the day.

We were writing custom software for businesses who thought that all that ""Windows"" stuff was a waste of money.

And they had a point. The current version of Windows was 2.0.3, and it was a pig. Personally, I preferred DesqView, when I was forced to work on PCs, though I had an Amiga at home.

Still, we were writing software for MsDOS 3.3 - without memory expansion, which meant we spent many hours pruning our overlay trees to get everything to fit in 640k.

There really weren't RDBMSes available for this environment. Instead of running a database server, our apps would manipulate the database files directly, using a linked C-ISAM library. No query language, simply code that would call index functions and read and write functions, etc. All the stuff that a SQL optimizer generates code to do we did ourselves, directly.

The ""network"", such as it was, was simply a file share, so all the apps running on different machines would manipulate the same database files.

But what about concurrency, you ask? Isn't it dangerous to have competing processes manipulating the same files? What about transactional integrity?

Well, you see, there wasn't any transactional integrity, because there weren't any transactions. If you wanted multiple database writes to be atomic, you needed to code it. Write the first record, write the second record, if the second write fails go back and delete the first, etc.

And there wasn't any locking, either, out of the box.

So what we had was a lock server. Every application, before it read or wrote a block to a database file, would make a network call to the lock server, reserving the block. And there had to be one instance of the lock server running on the local network, for any of this to work.

And, of course, since MsDOS was a single-tasking OS [sic], that meant a dedicated computer, on the network, running nothing but it. It didn't need a very powerful computer, or a very fast one. But it needed to be there. ([Sic] because in my mind, MsDOS wasn't an OS, it was program loader. Ditto for CP/M, MS Windows prior to Windows NT, Macintosh Finder prior to OSX, and pretty much everything else that pretended to be an OS on a desktop computer, except for OS/9 on the Radio Shack Color Computer. But, as I said, I had an Amiga, and was spoiled.)

So the customer pulled an old IBM PC (not a generic ""PC"", but an actual PC, back from the days when ""PC"" was the actual model name), configured autoexec.bat to run the lock server, stuck it in the corner and plugged it into the network.

Skip two years.

We get an emergency call. The customer had had a power outage, and when the power came back up nothing would work.

All of our apps reported ""unable to connect to lock server"", and exited. None of the employees knew what the lock server was, or where that old PC was.

It took us an hour on the phone to find someone who could locate that PC and report on its status.

""It's not working.""

Another hour on the phone to eventually confirm that yes, it was plugged in to power and to the network, and that when you turned it on the little lights did turn on. But ""it's not working.""

So, four hour drive out to the site.

Thats expensive and unnecessary,"A few years back I was working in automation. Office  buildings, factories, homes and many more we would make configurations for the automation for the climate control, lighting, alarm systems etc. We also wrote new programms on demand. One time a client which had costumers and employees working in their building asked us to do automation in their new building. They had windows 7 still going when windows 10 was brand new. We made the configuration and tested everything and it was all wonderful. 

Until this point the contact had been with the building developer, he asked us to get in touch with the client for the final details. We explained our product and what we had done and made some final configurations and then asked about the server. We usually do on premise dedicated automation servers but anything is possible for the right price. This client wanted to save some money on a million euro project and wanted a virtual server on a computer which was used for the electronic information boards. We told him it was a bad idea and explained why but the client had his mind made up.

Over the next years he sometimes would have small incidents like a sensor malfunction or a battery running low and hire us to do some work. Then he found a company cheaper than us. We didn't make much money of the client anyway so we happily turned over our configuration manual and some explanation to the cheaper company. We told them the information board computer also hosted the server and that it wouldn't work on windows 10 as you had to make an export, and reinstall with a software upgrade. 

After a year or so the client called us in rage. They had upgraded all the computers in the building to windows 10 using a student team. The information board computer had a sticker on it which said dont, but the students had checked if that software was compatible and upgraded the computer, not knowing the automation server was on there too.

The new cheaper company which took over from us had made changes in the configuration but never made a back up or did their administration. The lights wouldn't turn on, ventilation didn't work, the car park, the automated doors. Nothing worked anymore. We had a good laugh and gave our last back up to cheaper company and told them good luck.

Our usual servers run on Linux and cost about 500 euros.",275,0,1
"I’m sorry you have to wait a bit, but holding me hostage won’t fix the problem any faster","&gt; Be me, over the phone/remote support

&gt; get call from elderly gentleman 

&gt; Run through basic troubleshooting 

&gt;About 12 minutes in I’m pretty sure I’ve figured out his problem despite his insistence on only wireless connections

&gt; “Looks like the line in to your home or your AWG is the point of failure. I can’t seem to narrow it down any further from my desk. I’ll have a technician out as soon as possible, which given your location is going to be the 28th, to fix it”

&gt;Old boy is NOT happy with this

&gt; Demands I fix it sooner

&gt;I explain that due to health and safety concerns, the field techs who do work on drops and direct lines are stretched thin right now and we understand that wait times are longer than normal. 

&gt; “I can mail you a replacement unit, but it will take 3-5 business days and you can call us back if you have any issues with the process or there’s a store within about 15-20 minutes of you that can do an equipment swap tonight. In my professional opinion the problem is most likely the line coming from outside, but I won’t stop you from doing this and calling us back if you need help”

&gt; This gentleman seems VERY interested in exactly where this store is and I give him the address several times and describe landmarks and local businesses to aid him on his journey

&gt;At this point I’m just waiting for this now 20 minute call to end so I can get on with my day

&gt;IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not allowed to hang up on people who call in and must allow them to end the call. The only exception is when a suspected disconnect occurs. 

&gt; I then hear a door close and what sounds like a rumble. 

&gt;This asshole is keeping me on the phone as he drives all the way to the store

&gt;”Sir, is there anything else relating to your at home services I can assist you with?” 

&gt;He states he’s purposefully keeping me on the line to explain to store employees what needs to be done (a simple equipment swap that I have assured him won’t cost any money as his equipment is leased from his ISP)

&gt;20 minutes later I hear a beep. 

&gt;We have arrived

&gt;A nice lady at the store guides him through the whole process and I’m forced to wait as I cannot interact with him 

&gt;Another 20 minute drive back where he puts me on hold to call someone else 

&gt;I still can’t hang up

&gt;My stomach growls as I had planned on taking a late lunch after what should have been a 12 minute call to fuel up a post shift gym session

&gt;Over an hour has passed since the call started

&gt;His son will be at the house and I get to guide them through the set up process because “I’m just no good at these computer things” despite the process of plugging a modem+router in to require no technical ability higher than round pegs in to square holes

&gt;I can’t help but think he’s doing this on purpose because obviously new equipment will fix a line issue

&gt; His idiot son literally requires me to explain every single step involved from tightening a coaxial cable to plugging in the power

&gt;There are instructions literally in the box good sir

&gt;45 minutes later the modem and router are finally set up, MAC addresses are corrected on accounts, and WiFi passwords have been set up

&gt;Still no Internet access

&gt;Explain to both of them that WiFi with no Internet means the equipment is fully functional, but as I said earlier, this is an issue with the outside line

&gt;Son proclaims 10 day wait period is unacceptable as he does emergency surgery and requires Internet for patient contact

&gt;”Sir, unless you are experiencing a medical emergency or there is a health hazard I cannot force a tech out any faster”

&gt; “I NEED Internet to contact patients!”

&gt;You and the 100 other people I speak to a day

&gt; At this point over 2 hours have gone by and my shift should have ended 5 minutes ago. I’m hungry as shit and have run out of fucks to give

&gt;Just deadpan tell him “Sir, unless you are experiencing a personal medical issue due to this, I *cannot* escalate this issue

&gt;Idiot son rages out and I guess he throws the phone

&gt;Call is still active, but I cannot hear the other end

No big deal, we agreed that temporarily we would host it on their reception computer (with a backup elsewhere) as that computer is on whenever they’re in the office.

The problem is that computer really is in bad shape and never gets rebooted... so today, I get the message.

Cust: “I thought *application* didn’t need to be on the computer anymore.”

Me: “well it never HAS to be but we never purchased a dedicated piece of hardware so.. it’s still on there.”

Cust: “It’s not working and everything is down”

Me: “Okay, let me see what I can do remotely..”

*Sees web interface, gets “server error”*

Me: “Okay so the good news is that the computers online but something is locked up. Can you please reboot that computer for me?”

Cust (rudely): “I already did that but I *guess* I can do it again. What are the next steps?”

Me (internally): “I’m booked today there’s no way I can get out there until next week this will be fun”

Me: “When it reboots I’ll try to get in remotely and see if I can’t fix it or at least get more details from here”

Cust: “I rebooted the endpoints and that seems to have fixed it”

Me: “Oh great!”

Cust: *no response cause apparently it’s my fault*

So after the interaction is over, I go to see the logs of the machine and as a surprise to no one, it hasn’t been rebooted for weeks until after I requested the reboot. I tried to use this to make clear the need for a dedicated machine, but I was screaming into the void on that one. I really don’t have an issue with simple things like this, and I don’t mind helping my customers, but don’t lie to me and don’t be rude to me when I do drop what I’m doing to help.. 🙄",1475,0,1
"Bar Fly Tech Support: Or, Can You Hear Me Now?","I don't often have a chance to post here, but this was a funny little milieu that just happened.  For transparency, I'm not tech support, sysadmin, programmer, or anything of the sort.  I'm a stage hand, but deal with a lot of technical stuff in that job.  The bar manager at my regular bar knows this.  On with the story.

I'll be Me, the Bar Manager will be A, and I'm here in the mid afternoon when there are only a couple other people here, very spread out.

A:  ""Hey, Osiris, you're of a techie persuasion, could you help me with the phone?""

Me:  ""Sure, what's going on?

A: ""The phone is acting weird.  I can hear it ring, but when I pick it up, I get nothing.  The call then goes to voice mail, but I can only hear it at the base station.  I also can't call out.""

Me:  ""Okay, gimme the handset and I'll see what I can do.""

First thing's first- replicate the problem.  So I call the bar phone from my cell.  The bar phone rings, but when I pick up there is silence, followed by three beeps and the phone going dead.  Okay, do it the other way, call my phone from the bar phone.  No dial tone, just silence and the three beeps.

Definitely a connection issue.

I waive down A and ask her to get me the other handsets (there are a total of three).  I do the same checks with each.  No joy, just silence and three beeps.  So we can rule out the handsets.

I pull up the @&amp;T website, and look up the FAQ troubleshooting guide.  90% of the answers aren't applicable, but I start with the first thing, ""unplug it all, wait a bit, then plug it all back in again.""  So I de-battery the phones, and get A to go unplug the base station for 60 seconds.  Replug it all, try the checks again.  No joy, just silence and beeps.

Hmmm.  Go back through the troubleshooting guide.  ""Check all connections.""

Check.  ALL.  Connections. 

I ask A if I can see the base station.  She leads me around the back of the building and in through the back door to the office.  The base station is on a shelf along with the wifi router, a rack with what looks like a small server, and a couple of computer towers.  I pull the base station, the connections in the back are all quite solid.  The power cable is plugged into a rather new power strip, which is solidly plugged into the wall.  Then I follow the phone cable.

Oh.  My.  That cable has been here a while.  Not only is it cable stapled to the wall, it's obviously been so since the last remodel, which happened long before I became a regular six years ago.  The cable has been painted over with the same paint as the wall, right up to the wall jack.  And while the phone cable is *technically* in the jack, it's obviously not seated well.

So I pull it out.  Give it a twist to see if imparting torsion on the cable will keep it properly seated.  It goes in, but barely clicks.  Do the checks, and damn, it works!

A:  ""You are a genius, Osiris.  I can't believe you got it to work again.""

Me:  ""No, not a genius, just experienced.  But you need to do two things.  You need to replace this phone cable.  That's easy, just send someone up to Ace Hardware and have them buy a short phone cable.  Then, you need to talk to your handyman and have him replace that wall jack.  It has like 40 years of paint on it, and I bet the connections inside are iffy at best.""

A:  ""Doesn't matter to me, you fixed it.  Next two drinks are on the house.""

TL;DR - the phones are working again at McQueens, feel free to call and order food.  I recommend the corned beef and cabbage stew, it's absolutely stellar.",287,0,1
"Whitelisting, the answer for everything","Our company suddenly started experiencing issues sending emails to a third party company that brokers business for various small companies.  I did a bit of diagnostic work, and discovered our third party mail filter is unable to contact their mail server.  The MX record resolved to www1.COMPANYNAME.com.au which couldn't be contacted.  I also discovered they manage their own domain records on their own name servers.

So I gave their helpdesk a call.  This is a summary of the conversation.


Me:  ""Hello, we're having problems sending emails to your domain.  Our third party mail filter is unable to communicate with www1.COMPANYNAME.com.au at IP X.X.X.X

"You said the machine could do this, I know you did!","TL: DR at bottom

Most techs can confirm and will agree that the less users who use/have access to equipment the better. Have a printer/copier that runs 100k prints a month with one or two users and you might get a service call once every three months for routine maintenance, same piece of equipment running 20k prints a month with 30+ users and you’re lucky to go two weeks without someone having an “ïssue”. The same rule holds true for workstations/servers. With that said I think schools are by far one of the worst places to have to deal with service issues because teachers never print things early or plan ahead and usually have to have things “NOW! I’m late for class!” Those that do plan ahead are unicorns and God sent users to make our lives a little easier. I was normally the setup tech on jobs and instructed users in small groups on how to use/operate the machine, after dealing with an abundant amount of “sales trained” user issues I finally got them to let me tag along and do the training. Now on to the story:

This is another story from early 2000’s. We had several service contracts for multiple school districts across several counties and when they called in they got top priority. This particular school district was always a pain, the high school was good because they had multiple machines on a single floor layout and one main unit in the office that was setup as the go to machine for almost all teachers print outs. The secretaries in the office were the select few who could change supplies and remove paper jams with no troubles, if they couldn’t get it they left it alone and called for service *AHHHH, angelic voices praising their rarity*. The middle school was next as they had a similar setup but also had a secondary main unit on the second floor due to the layout and amount of teachers, again a select few users knew what they were doing and rarely got calls for this school as well. Now the elementary school…. I don’t know if it was due to dealing with younger kids or that the teachers were just a different breed but the elementary school was always the problem child of the three. The layout was all over the place and they had no main machines for most users, they even had a copier by the lunch/break room along the wall out in the hall with the students. This machine was not the one with issues this particular day, no this one was in the teachers stock room with no AC and an army of spiders waiting to descend upon anything alive left alone in the dark. We got a call mid-morning that this machine was jammed, nothing was going through and it had a horrible “melted plastic smell”

*How many techs now exactly where this is headed?*

I get on site and of course the machine is still powered on, half the covers left open, jam indicators all over the place, and the lingering smell of melted plastic wafting in the air due to zero air flow in the room. I clear out all the jams and close everything up to see what happens, machine warms up and starts to resume the print job, sure enough paper jam at paper exit and back through the machine. I again go through the machine but there’s no paper at the exit section, I do however have a nice accordion sticking out of the fuser entry.

*Please don’t let this be what I think it is*

I power the machine off and proceed to take things apart to get the fuser out, as soon as I had it in my hands I knew what I feared was in fact the issue. An over-head projector transparency…

Now for those who aren’t cringing at this let me explain, there are two main types of transparencies. Those that are rated for laser printers/copiers and those that are rated for inkjet printers. You do NOT use inkjet transparencies in a laser machine, you’re going to have a bad day! Well, your repair tech will have a bad day, users could care less.  Laser printers/copiers have fusers that heat up to a couple hundred degrees, inkjets have ZERO heat. So the transparencies meant for laser machines are made to NOT turn into a giant melted pile of your day just got a whole lot worse, inkjet transparencies on the other hand if used in a laser machine will turn into an instant glob of melted plastic that hardens into a brick.

I say this because it’s not just one transparency melted into the fuser, oh no that’d be too easy, no whoever was trying to print these transparencies felt the need to keep trying after the first one failed. The entire exit section of the fuser was one giant glob of plastic, sadly it had not hit the exit actuator in the fuser which would’ve completely stopped the copier from working do to it never resetting the jam. I’m guessing there was a good five or six transparencies melted into the fuser. One of the rules our manager had was if you can get a machine working get it working, even if it looks bad on prints get it working at least. So I proceed to clear a spot on one of the tables in the room, grab a chair, my cutters, forceps, tweezers, pliers, and I start prying/cutting/pulling/picking apart this mass of hardened plastic. Roughly an hour and a half later I have removed said plastic, I then spent about 30 minutes straightening guides and brackets so the separation fingers and actuators worked properly. Luckily the heat roller is Teflon coated so I just had to wipe it clean. I finally put the copier back together and after warm up it fires out the print job that was still waiting to come through, SUCCESS!!!

Now the reason I mentioned above that I was the one who trained the users is because when I train them I specifically ask if they are ever going to do transparencies, if they say yes I make it a MAJOR point to explain the difference between transparency types and that inkjet transparencies are not to come anywhere NEAR the copiers because they will do exactly what happened here. I know I trained this school so I take the print job to the office to find out what teacher it belonged to and asked if they could meet me at the copier. The secretary buzzes the teacher and I head back to the copier.

I need to note I’ve dealt with a lot of customers who get defensive the second you question anything they’ve done to equipment (As I’m sure EVERY tech reading this has) so I know to keep a calm, cool, customer service voice and to always be polite while trying to explain things, you have to baby step people to understand that they screwed up but it’s not a big deal if they learn from it.

M: Me 

T: Teacher


T: The office said you wanted to talk to me?

M: Yes, do you remember when I trained you how to use the copier I showed you how to do transparencies?

T: Of course I do, you always put them in the side tray.

M: Correct, do you remember the other thing I made a big deal about when doing transparencies?

T: *looks offended I asked this question* No, you only said to use the side tray, these copiers can run transparencies. You told us it could!

M: It can, may I please see the box of transparencies you used?

T: *half in a huff* walks past me to another section of shelves and grabs the transparencies. Here I used these I brought from home, I like theses better than the ones we have here.

M: And where are the ones that the school provides?

*getting angrier* walks to shelves again and shoves the box in my hand.

T: Here!

M: I place the boxes side by side and show her where it clearly says on the boxes in big bold letters INKJET and LASER/COPIER. Do you see the product description here?

T: Of course, what’s the big deal they’re both transparencies.

M: Well the big deal is that the ones that say laser/copiers are meant to be used in the copier, the ones that say inkjet are not.

T: They’re both transparencies, you said we could use transparencies in this machine, I know you said we could!

M: I did but I made sure to mention to use laser/copier rated ones only.

T: There can’t be much difference between them, what’s the big deal!

M: Well the big deal the ones I said will work will work fine and the others do this. I then show her the massive pile of melted plastic bits I had sitting on the table covered up with a rag.

T: *Oh shit face* There’s no way that was in the copier! I pulled all the jams out earlier and finally gave up after a while.

I proceeded to explain what I typed above and showed her exactly where it all got caught in the copier. I said if she wants to use her own transparencies it has to say laser/copier on the box or else it will happen again and there will be a bill for repairs.

T: *sheepishly* Ok, I think I’ll just use the ones the school has.

M: That would probably be best, I just don’t want you to get in trouble. You’re not the first person to do this and won’t be the last, but so far you are defiantly the most persistent to try and get it to work. You have a good day ok.

T: thank you… you too

I packed up, wrote up my paperwork, and headed back to the shop. I made notes to replace the couple of guides I “repaired” next time a tech was in the area. I honestly didn’t want her getting in trouble for this. She wasn’t the first user who had done this but most give up after the first or second attempt.
 
TL: DR – teacher uses wrong type of transparencies in copier and makes a very big mess of melted plastic I had to remove.

"""Why did my report change"", angry sales manager said","I sometimes work with customizing BI reports/visualizations for our clients. Today I got an email request to do a minor change from the sales manager at one of our clients. From previous interactions I already knew this guy tends to be very unspecific and blunt in his requests.

Now BI can be a very complicated field and it's not uncommon to go through misunderstandings and lots of back and forth with the client to get the correct end result, but in this case it's a very simple report and scenario, so it should be easy enough to follow:

Just imagine a order report that is simply a table of three columns: Customer name, the date of the order and the amount of the order. This report is sorted by the order amount, and is cut off at 10 orders. So the point of the report is to show the largest 10 orders this month, which is why it's titled ""Top 10 orders"".

**Client:** ""Hi, I would like to have the ""Top 10 orders"" report changed to be sorted by date instead of amount.""

*(To sort the entire table by date all I basically have to do is click the date column, which was my first instinct, but I quickly realised that was probably not actually what he wanted, or so I thought)..*

**Me:** ""Okay, no problem. Now the current use of the report is to show the 10 largest orders this month, so if I change the sorting to date it wouldn't actually show the largest orders anymore since there are obviously way more than 10 orders in the system.... Or when I think about it, I guess what you are asking is that it should still display the top 10 orders, but out of those ten it is sorted by date? Is that correct? That's gonna take a little more work but I can get it done within the hour.""

**Client:** ""No, you misunderstand. Doesn't matter if it's the top 10 orders or not. I just want it to sort by date, so that the last order is at the top""

**Me:** ""Okay, so you just want to the report sorted by date even if it's not the 10 largest orders this month? No problem, but I guess that changes the purpose of the report so maybe it should be titled ""Latest 10 orders"" instead? Are you sure you don't want this a separate report so you can still have the ""Top 10 orders"" in place?""

**Client:** ""Why are you making this so complicated? Just give me the report sorted by date, it shouldn't be that hard!""

**Me:** ""...............Alright. So I'll sort it by date and I won't rename it, and I'll call you when it's done in a few minutes, and then you can let me know if the end result is how you wanted it. Okay?""

**Client:** ""Fine.""

*Now I very well knew that this was not going to turn out the as he wanted (whatever it is that he wanted), but I was so dumbfounded at the lack of understanding so I thought it's better if he just saw for himself. I clicked date column to sort by it and saved the report, and of course the orders in the table are now simply the latest 10 orders in the system, not the largest ones. Which really irks me when the report is called ""Top 10 orders"", but that is how he said he wanted it...*

I call the customer:

**Me:** ""Okay it's done, take a look if you can"".

**Client:** ""But this is not the same report as earlier? Why did it change?""

**Me:** ""Well, we changed the sorting? Other than that it's exactly the same.""

**Client:** ""How can you say it's exactly the same? None of the customers I had in the report previously are there now? I specifically remember having Customer X, Customer Y and Customer Z in the report but they're not there anymore.""

**Me**: ""Well I would assume that's because those customers aren't among the last 10 customers to have purchased something.""

**Client:** ""Why does that make a difference? I just told you to make the same report sorted by date!""

**Me:** ""This was my initial concern. That's why I asked if you want the largest top 10 orders in the table, and then those 10 orders were sorted by date? We can do that if you want, no problem"".

**Client:** ""And I already told you it doesn't matter if it's the top 10 orders! The last order to come through should be at the top!""

**Me:** ""And if you look at it now, is the top order not the last order?""

*At this point I can practically hear the logical meltdown through the phone.*

We still went through a couple of back and forths and I'm still not sure what he actually wanted, but I honestly don't really think he knew himself. We ended up not touching the report anymore even though I strongly suggested to rename it so that others wouldn't be confused by the title which does not correspond with the result set anymore, but he wouldn't hear any of that.",1842,0,1
Idiot Vendor fails to read,"SITREP: I was working on contract in public transportation many years past. The system for dealing with cash and credit fares, cards, passes, tickets, and gates was in the process of being replaced based on age and Windows expired OS editions.

BLAMEES: There's only two.

Me: Your homicidal anti-hero [aka DSoTR] who's designed, implemented, deployed, migrated, and maintained AD in billion dollar companies since its inception in 2000, and before that LDAP on a defunct OS's  4.11 release.

IdiotVendor - they support our wildly out of date system above. They do NOT deal with the OS or anything else beyond their specific hardware and applications.

It was early spring when the ticket arrived in my queue - well, less of a ticket and more of an email - that scheduled tasks on one of our servers are failing with the message ""could not start"". IdiotVendor has been manually starting these tasks daily rather than letting us know they're failing in the overnight, and now it's urgent because the person who has been doing this is manual task is going on holiday.

I respond with a short email asking what server and what tasks are failing.

Four hours later a wild screenshot appears - with nine scheduled tasks all failed out, and I spot the incidental inclusion of the server name since apparently writing out the name in the email body is hard.

It's one host on a cluster. I have additional questions.

A little back and forth about nodes and jobs and I finally get some answers.

*    These tasks run on the the active node.

*    The jobs on the passive node should not still be running a week later.

*    IdiotVendor uses drive letter mappings rather than UNC paths.

*    Reiteration that IdiotVendor's tech in on holiday next week making this UrGEnT!

*    My question on user account and special privileges remains unanswered.

*    When user/pass is re-entered into one scheduled task ALL failed scheduled tasks work again for a while.

*    IdiotVendor claims that password is being deleted by some security process on our end.

""Well, that's not the problem,"" says I to myself. We don't have a password scraper, and even if we did re-entering one scheduled task's user/pass combination wouldn't cause all of them to change.

The game is afoot!

Check out the history of one task, then another, then a third. Yup, all consistent failed at nearly the same time, with the logs saying:

    The specific error is: 0x80070569: Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.

AHA! says I. I know this tune. We locked down user right assignment for a specific compliance we need to meet.

Send IdiotVendor my findings - the error points away from passwords and towards a rights issue, and reiterate my question as to whether said user account needs special rights a conventional user would not possess.

IdiotVendor re-iterates there's no way it's a user rights issue and it's got to be passwords because it wouldn't work then fail if it was user rights.

We agree to create a new account and password for exclusive use for the scheduled tasks, since using Domain Admin is completely stupid. This is accomplished in short order, I change these on all scheduled tasks, and we're off to the races. IdiotVendor will monitor in the overnight.

Tasks fail in the overnight, as I expected.

IdiotVendor emails me in the deep dark of REM sleep. I'm not on call, so my phone isn't nearby, and I'm not answering.

IdiotVendor email again at a more sane hour, pulling my boss and the rest of my team into the email chain.

I seethe.

Log on, look around, scheduled task log files are gone. Well, so much for troubleshooting the logs. Event logs show GPO applied seconds before all jobs started to fail, and literally nothing else that's out of scope or specification. Even a check of security logs on all DCs show this new account hasn't had a bad password attempt since I mistyped it during setup.

Wait, there's an open command prompt. That wasn't there yesterday.

IDIOTVENDOR MOVED THE LOG FILE FROM ITS DEFAULT LOCATION AND DID NOT TELL ME THIS

BurnThemAll.gif

Ask IdiotVendor to confirm there's no user rights assignments for the account required. I need them to confirm this to end this fucking charade of technical incompetence disguised thinly as technical skill.

They say this does not happen on their test system.

#Well, there's your problem!

Set password on one scheduled task.

All scheduled tasks start to work.

    gpupdate /force

All scheduled tasks fail.

All logs read ""The user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer.""

Guess what account needed User Right Assignment for Log on as a batch job?

Guess what GPO item I changed to allow this User Right Assignment?

I'll bet you awfully clever folks know what happened when I opened a command prompt and entered

    gpupdate /force

don't you?

Why yes, you did guess right - all jobs immediately work.

Do my final post-mortem for this moron.

1.    Scheduled task shows specific event

2.    IdiotVendor does manual workaround rather than reaching out to us

3.    IdiotVendor hasn't updated their test lab to our GPOs in well over a year

4.    Problem is exactly what I said the first time - User Rights Assignment

5.    Show timelines, problem determination, IdiotVendor and their lack of reading comprehension of the relevant log files

Bested the NetOps,"My little brother is a Director of Network Operations at a major software company, having worked his way up from technician. He's set up my wireless networks with a bunch of smart home stuff with a cool ITTT timers and stuff, he's way smarter than me with wires but I have to gloat a bit after I found the missing link today.

Brother = My Brother

So, My dad broke some ribs last weekend and texted asking if either brother or I could come help him since his internet was out but cable working after Brother was there putting in the new modem yesterday. Brother had meetings all morning so I trudged over there. I called Brother before hand to confirm he connected and tested everything before he left.  

I got there and checked the network with my phone and was able to get onto the WIFI, traverse to another computer on the network, hard wire directly into the modem and it all seemed fine. Plus the cable was working so I knew there was internet getting into the house. So, I walk into the other room where the router lives and notice the little globe is not showing. I opened up the Marco Polo App so I could record while I unplugged the Cable from the Numbered Port and into the Internet port. He texted and said he saw the wifi connect on his phone on the way out and was in a hurry so didn't check that there was actually internet.

So a case of 'trust but verify' even when the expert does his job.",346,0,1
Can we skip those steps?,"Here is a tale of how a user requested that we skip troubleshooting steps and assume that some things worked without testing them...

We were over the phone troubleshooting network connectivity of an ethernet port as it did not seem to be working. 

We went through all of the basic steps, reconnecting cable from device to wall, trying another cable, things like that. Most of the time this is caused by the drop not being patched in the server room to the switch, Then you just need to hope that you have labeling and can get that patched!

I talked the user (A technical one) through finding the port on the switch, and on the patch panel and connecting them. We then go to test the port again and still no connectivity. At this point I requested that we try to use another computer to test the connection, or another known working usb to ethernet adapter to confirm that the device we are using to troubleshoot is not the issue, as we fixed what was likely the actual issue. 

Their reply was asking if we could ""skip those steps"" because ""This laptop is almost brand new and I know it works well""... 

For those of us who have spent many an hour working with vendors, you know all too well, no matter how new it is, that does not mean it is immune to problems!

I am stunned by this and am not about to waste my time running in circles when we did not try to verify what we are using to test. I ask them to send pictures of the network closet to buy me time to think on how to handle this. 

A few hours later they emailed back saying that they figured it out, the port was active, it was the adapter that was the issue preventing it from working once it had been patched!

This is why you do not skip troubleshooting steps!",1455,0,1

He's prepared a few reports that use graphics, but it's normally in collaboration with other teams, and I hadn't heard of such a project since the lockdown happened. However, I don't hear everything, and we all know how communication can be lost right now. 

I shoot an email back.

&gt;(Me)I'm guessing the Fix button didn't resolve it?

&gt;(Employee)It sends you to this page (nvidia driver page - legit page), and at that point I am pretty lost and don't want to start downloading and installing stuff when I don't really know what I am doing. 

Okay, I'd rather people not feel comfortable installing random apps. That being said, he actually wouldn't be able to anyway without an admin logging in to approve it, so that's fine. 

&gt;(Me) I can remote in and do it. What's you IP? Hover over the black V in the bottom right corner (VNC viewer). 

An hour passes...

&gt;(Employee) I can't find the V.

This isn't the first time an employee hasn't been able to find it, so I just shrug it off. It's pretty late in the day at this point, so I shoot him a quick email back.

&gt;(Me) I'll go into the office tomorrow and fix it. 

It's actually nice to drive in and have the building to myself. I put on a podcast or stream something and don't have to worry about anyone else being bothered. 

I wander down to his desk, log into the machine. Everything looks good at this point, including the V in the corner (I snap a screen shot to show him for future issues), and then log into the program. No issues.

We have standard PCs which have onboard video cards, but a few have been upgraded if they do graphical work. 

This is not one of them. 

Curiouser and curiouser. 

So I attach a picture of the working program and the picture of the V, ship it back to him with a ""Updated the machine, everything seems to be working, try again and let me know"". 

Not even twenty minutes later 

&gt;(Employee) I just opened (program) and got the same message. On this computer, there isn't that V. 

What is going on?

&gt;(Me) What computer are you remoting to? The one at the downtown office? Because that one doesn't have an invidia graphics card. 

&gt;(Employee) Oh, this is happening on a loaner laptop I got from IT. (message continues, but my vision went completely red at that point, so I don't remember reading it further.)

Of course he wouldn't bother to mention he was doing something completely, utterly, mindbogglingly different from everyone else in the company. 

We have loaner laptops, but they're primarily for people who travel to conferences, or need to do presentations outside of our offices. None of them are set up for video editing. 

The remote software is also different, and not something I want to walk this guy through.

After I calm down a little, I send this back.

&gt;(Me) Okay, knowing it is a laptop and not your work PC is important information and explains why some of our previous fixes didn't work. I can't work on it remotely, so either we can schedule a time for you to come in and meet me, and I'll try to fix it quickly, or you can drop it off and I'll fix it in a day or two. 

This time it is quiet for almost a day before he finally emails me again. 

&gt;(Employee) I just went ahead and tried to fix it myself. It seems like it worked. 

(face palm)

Apparently driving 15 minutes into town is where he draws the line, and then suddenly his fear dissipated. If I were still a contractor, this would've been a conversation with the client, not to mention a fee for wasting my time, but a.) I'm an employee, b.) they pay me pretty well, and c.) the last few months have basically been an extended at home vacation, occasionally interrupted by me needing to remote into work, so I guess I can't really complain. 

There's going to be some in depth questions next time he has a problem, though.",417,0,1
My router doesn’t have an SSID!,"For context, I work for a cable company. I did field install and repair for years but have since been promoted to plant maintenance. 

I had just parked my truck on the side of the road and was getting ready to boom up for some work when a customer approached me. 

Me: Hi there! How can I help you sir?

Customer: Hi! I just had my equipment installed yesterday but my router doesn’t have an SSID so I can’t connect to WiFi. 

Me: That’s odd. All of our routers have an SSID built in by default. Did you check the sticker on the back? Or do you mean it isn’t broadcasting?

Customer: Yeah, it’s the weirdest thing, I can’t find any networks nearby. There are serial numbers and a Mac address on the sticker but no SSID!

Me: well, that sounds like what you’ve got is actually just a modem.

I start to explain to him that it takes two devices to make wi-fi internet work, a modem and a router but he cuts me off mid sentence. 

Customer: No no, it’s a combo unit.

Me: Combo units have the SSID on a sticker on the back. 

Customer: well, this one doesn’t.

Me: well, then isn’t a combo unit. It sounds like what you have is just a modem. 

Customer: No, it’s a combo unit. 

(Sigh)

Me: Well, I have some work to do here so I will be around for a little bit. If you want to bring it out I will have a look and confirm for you what kind of device it is, but it does not sound like you have a router. 

The customer looked visibly frustrated with me at this point, probably because he felt like I wasn’t listening to his problem. But the problem was pretty darn obvious to me. I started putting on my harness and putting down my wheel chocks. The customer scurried off down the road, mumbling and kicking at the gravel. 

About 15 minutes later he pulls up in a truck, gets out, walks right into my coned off safety area and stands right beneath my bucket while I’m in the air. I tell him he needs to move outside of my cones, and ask if he needs me to move my truck so he can get by.

Customer: No, I just brought my truck so when we’re done talking I can go and replace this defective router unit.

He then holds the device up in the air above his head, resembling Link having just discovered the master sword. Guess what kind of device it is!

It’s a standard issue modem.",907,0,1
An alternate definition of insanity,"Xray imaging software support tech here. We also deal in select imaging hardwares, basically a middleman between the manufacturers and the end user, with the intent that our software be used more or less exclusively with the hardware(s). These days, we push digital image receptors above all and they're ethernet- and wifi-enabled. The wifi ones are really cool actually, they host their own access points and everything, even DHCP for some of them. However, the AP can be somewhat unreliable, unfortunately, so we try to encourage that it be used as more of a last resort by sending out pre-configured routers to bridge the SSID.

Alas, some of our sales reps -- a.k.a. installers -- have sympathized with some doctors that the router is a bit cumbersome and have apparently decided (as I found out after this call) to just take the router *that was included in the packaged purchase* away entirely and instead replaced it with a USB wifi adapter -- a.k.a. a piece of s\*\*t with a range of 2 cm. The wifi range isn't the biggest issue, though: with a dual wifi setup, the user then needs to choose the correct wifi card and *then* connect to the correct network. God forbid.

So the following call ensues today:

lUser: I can not connect to the black xray box.

Me: Alrighty, then, let's take a look.

 *get remoted in, find 2 LAN ports, both disconnected, and 2 wifi cards, one labeled 'Office Wifi' currently connected the the office network, and the other labeled 'Panel Connection', disconnected.*

Me: Ok, so do you see the router anywhere?

lUser: Yes, so when I connect to \[panel SSID\] I lose connection to the network. Can you tell me: is this how it should be?

Me: ..Well, no, it doesn't have to be, but do you see a router? It's a little black box with antennae, says \[router brand\] on top?

lUser: Yes we have a router for the internet.

Me: Ok, but what about in the room with you, where you take your xrays?

lUser: No, there is no router for the black xray box, only for the internet. I connect to the \[panel SSID\] but when I do I disconnect from the internet. So can you make it so I can connect to both at the same time?

Me: I can but it's much easier with the router. I do see here that we sent you one.. are you sure it's not in the room with you anywhere?

lUser: Since I've worked here there has never been a router. Let me ask my office manager..... no, when you came and installed the system there was no router. We always connect to \[SSID\] but then we lose connection to the office network.

Me: Well, I can confirm in my notes that we supplied you a router to make connecting everything simpler -- I do suggest you find that router, it might be in the box still in a closet somewhere? -- but here: so you see this dropdown here? *show her how to switch between wifi cards in available networks list* So you select 'Office Wifi' then connect to your office network. You're already connected to the network, so now we'll select 'Panel connection' and then connect to the \[panel SSID\] *connects to the panel.*

lUser: .... Ok so can you connect me to the black xray box now please?

Me: Yes, I just did, see? *confirms connection in software*

lUser: Ok, that's good. But the problem is, when I connect to \[panel SSID\] I lose connection to the office network, and this computer needs to be connected to the office network in order for the doctor to be able to see the images in the patient rooms *(this current workstation is the database computer)*

Me: .... yes, I understand that, and I can assure you we're connected to both the panel and the internet right now. I wouldn't be connected through Teamviewer right now otherwise.

lUser: Yes, but you see, the problem is that when I connect to \[panel SSID\] I lose connection to the internet, but the doctor needs to see the xrays on another computer right after the xrays are taken, so how do I connect to both the office network and the black xray box at the same time?

Me: *checks to make sure my mic isn't muted..* ma'am you are connected to both right now. *explains how to utilize the different wifi cards again.* As long as you make sure to switch to 'Panel connection' when you connect to \[panel SSID\], you'll maintain your internet connection no problem.

*this cycle continues for 15 years, I eventually get an idea that HAS to get through.... right?*

Me: Ok, do this for me: go ahead and turn the panel off.

lUser: ......ok the light is red. Does that mean it's off?

Me: yes, it's off. So you see here there is no \[panel SSID\] so it's definitely off. Now, I'm still connected through Teamviewer, so we have internet. I can browse the internet. You're connected to your office network. Now go ahead and turn the panel on...

lUser: .....ok, it beeped.

Me: Yep, I heard it, and there's the panel's network in the list. So I'm going to connect to it, using the 'Panel Connection' option here.. and now you see, I can still browse the internet *searches 'random joke' in google*  see? I'm getting search results, I can go to web pages, we are definitely connected to the internet, AND... *goes to software, confirms connection* look! We have a connection to the panel. 

lUser: .... ok..... But how can I be sure that when I connect to the \[panel SSID\] that I won't be disconnected from the office network?

Me: *palm already hurts, starting to create a crater in my desk* Ma'am, talk to your office manager, maybe even your IT, check your closets and drawers -- just FIND THE ROUTER. It will make your life a lot simpler.",240,0,1
My phone keeps playing music at random times!,"So first: it won't be very long. I am not good at that.

But let's start.

Normal summer day in a Polish seaside city. I was waiting for my (Not so) Fast City Rail service (actually slower than normal trains) as I was going for my sailing lessons. I buy a ticket in a ticket machine, and this mid-30s guy (G) approaches me (I am 15).

G - Good morning, sorry to interrupt you but my phone keeps playing music at random times.

Me - Really?

Phone - *starts playing music*

G - See? I didn't do anything.

Me - Have you tried to restart the device? It works often when something wrong happens.

G - Yeah, I tried but it didn't work.

Me - Can I see your phone then?

G - Sure.

It was a Huawei. Looking near to mine, just older model. First thing I saw was a weird app for functions you already get in there - alarm.

Me - Do you know sir that you have this function in your phone already? Also, this app looks a bit sketchy to me.

G - if it will fix the problem, delete it.

So I delete the app, just when my train approaches the station.

Me - Sorry, I have to go now, my train is there.

G - I am also going on that train.

Me - Ok, I can continue trying to solve the problem there.

We boarded the train, sat down. Guess what the phone did? *Plays that song again*

Me - I think the app was not the problem then. I need to see what causes that.

G - OK.

Then I saw IT. Just when the notification on top of the screen shows up, the music restarts. *BINGO.*

Me - I think I know the problem. Can I go into device settings? (I asked it due to the fact I wouldn't want anyone to mess in my settings). I think I know the problem.

I go directly to notifications, and what tone is selected for those. It was a whole, 3 minute song. I select a random, MUCH shorter notification.

Me - I found it. The song (pointing at the name of the song on the screen) was selected as a notification. I selected a shorter one, but feel free to change it to other one, as long as it is around as short as this one, or you'll still have the same problem.

G - Can you tell me where to get to those settings then?

Me - Sure. (Shows him how to do it).

G - Thanks!

Then we talked a bit - about him getting a new flat, about his new bluetooth headphones that were apparently not working (due to being a very cheap ones, around 10$ in Poland) and I told him that for this money he can get good wire headphones. He tried mine, but headphones are not the point of this post. When the train arrived to my station, he thanked me again for my help, we said goodbye and I left so I wouldn't be late for my trolleybus.",610,0,1
100% CPU Usage,"Alright so this just happened...

TLDR A customer ordered a shitty computer and after her declining my and my managers offer to change to a better one, she comes back in demanding to fix her “slow” computer

So this customer orders a $hitty Ollee laptop (Celeron CPU, 4GB RAM, 64GB HDD) from us, I call her and politely advice her how shit of a choice that she’s making and she goes “no it’s ok i did my research I want that one”.

She has then asked me to install Office on her computer. So i’m doing it and it literally took like 3 seconds to even open the start menu, so I was like well let’s just have a look at the CPU Performance, then I come across this... 100% OF THE CPU.... FOR INSTALLING OFFICE IM SORRY WHAT. So I give it to her.

and today she comes wandering back in and the conversation goes roughly as follows:

Customer: “I bought this computer from you guys the other day”

Me: “Yes I remember, how’s it all going”

Customer: *snaps\* “What do you think, it’s an absolute sh** house”

Me: “Unfortunately yeah it wasn’t the best of the computers”

Customer: “Well that’s ridiculous there has to be a way you can fix it, take it right now and fix it”

At this point I go talk to the manager and he says the exact same thing I said, she bought a horrible computer, you offered a different computer, she was fully aware of what it would be like. He said for me to save the stress and swap it over and she can pay the difference

Me: “So my manager has just reinstated what I said, the quality of the computer is not built for much but my manager wants to-“

Customer: “Thats just f**king ridiculous I bought a $400 computer from you guys I expect at the least better service”

Me: “Look we’re not supposed to but my manager has authorised me to be able to swap it over to another computer and you can pay the difference”

Customer: “I’m not paying another cent!!! Just fix my computer and make it faster”

Me: “There’s literally nothing I can do with that, I did advise you on the day that this computer was not made to do much” (I know there are ways to optimise speeds within reason but the company I work for don’t allow us to do it)

After that it goes back and forth but I end up closing the door on her while she kicks up a fuss and yeah, long story short don’t buy shitty computers 😂

The Quiet Fixer,"OK this one is short-ish but I had to mention it...

Go back a couple jobs when I was just a tier 1 support person, we had this mean lady in accounting (yes all the stereotypes apply here) who instead of calling us/submitting a ticket for help would just try to fix things herself. I applaud self sufficiency in trying to fix your own problems but at a certain point just stop and let the experts do it. This started with software issues and what not but then....

One day I walk into the copier room (had about 3 different devices in there) and I find one with the panels open, screws laying on the counter and no one around. I have no clue who or what. I called the printer company we had a service contract with and they put it back together and found a paper jam. No biggy right?

Fast forward a month now. The printer in accounting is broken, someone else called it in. I go over there and same thing, panels open, screws laying there, and this time a screwdriver. I recognized the screwdriver as I've seen it laying on the accounting lady's desk before so I went up to her with it and she admitted she tried to ""fix"" it because it was jammed and gave up. Didn't tell us or her coworkers or anyone.

Printer company comes out again, this time she messed it up good. I mean broken components and she shoved the screwdriver through the fuser on the printer needing extensive work (and not cheap). Printer company told me. I told bosses. Bosses got together and told her that any more of her attempted ""repairs"" she was going to pay for out of her own paycheck. And since that was her job she would have to fill out the paperwork for the withholding herself. Lol. Never happened again.",319,0,1
The firing of a frequent flyer,"When I worked at an MSP, one of our major clients was a huge law firm with about 100+ employees.

Out of that client, however, one user - Phil -  called almost daily about things that were easily fixable, but insisted it be resolved by an on-site tech. The client had a weekly visit by the on-site tech to follow up on minor issues, but anything beyond that required an emergency dispatch (and a high billing rate). Phil didn't care, he didn't want to perform any remote troubleshooting and the issue always had to be fixed ASAP - even though it could be resolved with an agent over the phone.

One day the account manager for that client pulled a log of all the tickets they had opened with support for the last six months. The client management was demanding to know why their support bill was so high and why they were losing productivity because of down computer equipment. The account manager showed that Phil was the driving force behind the majority of their support calls, always demanding the issue be fixed by the on-site tech and never working with the remote support. Apparently, whenever Phil had a ""computer problem"" he would refuse to do any work because his system was ""broken"" until a tech came to fix it - he wouldn't even switch to another available workstation because of ""ergonomic concerns"".

However, after poring over the call logs provided by our account manager, the client found out that Phil had a habit of calling whenever a report was due, which was then delayed because of a random ""computer problem"". Also, Phil was still logging the hours he spent waiting for his computer to be fixed as time worked on a case (a big no-no in the legal profession because it could be considered fraudulent billing).

The last straw for Phil's boss was a call I took. Phil's mouse was no longer working. Yes, it was securely connected to the workstation. No, it didn't work on other workstations. Yes, another mouse worked on his system. No, using the other mouse wasn't an acceptable solution because he had a special ""ergo"" mouse. Fortunately, there was already going to be a tech on-site for the weekly visit that day. I told the tech about Phil's mouse issue, and he packed a spare ergo mouse that was the same model for a swap.

When the tech got out there, he discovered:
1. Phil didn't use a special ergonomic mouse, it was the standard one that came with his computer.
2. The mouse was *not* securely connected.
3. After plugging the mouse in tight, it worked.

Phil was let go immediately after that and suddenly the client's call volume dropped.",2269,0,1
Website IP-blocking woes,"Hello! Long time lurker, first time poster. This tale just happened a few minutes ago, and I need to vent this out.

&amp;nbsp;

To pave over a lot of minor details, our LAN &amp; WiFi are completely separated from each other, with each having its own public IP address. 

&amp;nbsp;

Recently, our hosting provider was blocking IP addresses from our range. Needless to say, a few weeks ago, we had to resolve our LAN being blocked from accessing our own website. We had to get our manager to talk to the provider to get it unblocked (They only unblock with managerial/executive approval, and we can't remove the block ourselves). The problem was fixed, and we moved on.

&amp;nbsp;

We now approach our current problem: Our WiFi is now the network that is being blocked by our hosting provider. The answer should be as simple as the last one: Get our manager to talk to the provider again to unblock the WiFi's IP address. This is where the problem starts:

&amp;nbsp;

Manager: (After checking it himself using his WiFi-connected phone) Why can't I see to our website?!?

Support Guy 1: Like we said earlier, our hosting provider blocked us via our WiFi's IP address. They'll only unblock if you tell them to.

Manager: Then why can I still access (national bank)'s website? And why can I still access our website on my desktop? (Desktop's connected to LAN)

Me: Because only our provider's hosted websites are blocked to only our WiFi. (national bank) likely doesn't use our provider. Also, our LAN &amp; our WiFi are 2 separate networks.

Manager: So it is our WiFi's problem.

Support Guy 1: No, it's our hosting provider. They're blocking us via our WiFi's IP address.

Manager: Then why can I access (rival)'s website?

Me: Because (rival) probably doesn't use our provider. Only our provider's hosted websites are blocked to us.

(Repeat a few more times: Manager asking why he can still access **insert website that probably doesn't use our provider**, or why he can still access it via his desktop. We respond with the same answer(s): ""provider is blocking us via our WiFi's IP address"", ""**Other website** probably doesn't use our provider"", or ""LAN's address wasn't blocked, so it wasn't affected"".) 

Support Guy 1: We keep telling you, it's our provider. You need to call them to unblock us via our WiFi's IP address.

Manager: (finally clicks) So it's our hosting provider.

&amp;nbsp;

We still can't access our website using our WiFi, and our manager is still on hold with our provider. Just another day I guess.",207,0,1
Followup: the guy who changed printer settings to avoid work,"
[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/iqz65c/sure_printer_settings_change_on_their_own/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

It's monday and I'm back to work. First thing I notice during the morning routine is that the guy I reported, who talked about messing with the printer settings to his buddy in the break room, wasn't there.

Since I was the one solving everything I thought hey maybe I can get some more info on this, because no one really knew what happened and my coworkers couldn't tell me anything either. So I took my laptop and to my surprise, my boss Cc'd me in the email excange. 

What I now know: Ok so the guy wasn't fired. I would have been surprised otherwise. It's not that easy to fire someone in germany and in this case the main point of the excuse was that he didn't know that changing a mere two settings could have such a bug impact so he was given a warning, but not fired. Secondly they transferred him to the packaging department (a department that, for what it is, is surprisingly void of printers ...). And lastly from what I know they cut his pay somewhat. They can't really do much there because the amount is set, but they're allowed to cut some for the damages he caused for quite a while.

Are those the right solutions? I don't know. I don't really care either because for me it was just me doing my job. But does he deserve it for messing with production? I think so, yeah.",1675,0,1
"""I read the email, but...!"" Part 2","Hi friends, I'm back with another tale! You may remember my previous post you can [read about here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/i3pl1r/i_read_the_email_but/). TL;DR - Major unplanned system outage, only email was working since its Exchange, and everyone and their mother's dog called asking why they couldn't get in to XYZ program specifically mentioned in the email.

Well, now its time for the follow up emails, and the disaster that has been today.

Since the fallout of said outage, we've been rolling out Multi-factor authentication to all end users. This is a large company, so we've been doing it in bits and pieces over the past few weeks, and it's been working pretty well. Until today, that is.

You see, last week we sent out a mass email, saying that MFA **NEEDS** to be set up by end of day on Friday for **EVERYONE**. Otherwise, you won't be able to sign in to, well, anything that uses network credentials come Monday morning. Gave the dates in big, bold letters in the subject, gave step by step instructions on how to set it up, and even included a nice video of a person setting it up. Gotta go above and beyond, then end users will understand how important this is and what to do, right?

If you guessed right, you're obviously a comedian, or put waaaay to much faith in the average person. Dozens upon dozens of calls and emails flooding the help desk, each one a different version of the same story:

""I can't sign in to $PROGRAM, it keeps asking for a code, what is that, it's never been there before?!""

I casually mention the email sent out last week (omitting the part about it being sent out EVERY DAY last week), and the responses are varied, but similiar:

""I didn't know that email applied me.""

""I thought that was only for people working remotely.""

""The instructions aren't very clear""

Or, my favorite: ""I already did it, and its still not working!"" (No, no you didn't Karen, I can literally see you haven't even tried to set it up yet)

At least its pretty easy to set up....so long as you can understand such difficult concepts as ""Click on the MFA link in your email,"" and ""Enter the code it sends to your phone.""

And of course, once I get it set up, without fail, I get such a lovely follow up question: 

""Am I going to have to do this *every day?*"" They say, some with genuine curiosity, most with disgusted discontent.

Yes, yes you do. It takes about an extra 8 seconds of your time to generate and enter the code. Trust me, I've been doing it for a month now. If that 8 seconds is really messing up your schedule, you might want to rethink your morning Starbucks run.",339,0,1
Sometimes the complicated ones are simple,"I work at a national MSP, worked my way up the food chain until I was the highest level engineer (above senior) for the region. Specialized in data center builds, full stack. Worked the complicated / high value projects, and escalations that market seniors couldn't figure out. Flew all over the country for both when needed.

Had a large customer with a small group in a remote area of Denver, single server. Local engineers had done a new server project; migrated AD, files and printer to a new box, pulled the old one. Worked fine for a bit after cutover, but users started complaining about losing access intermittently (maybe 2-8 times a day, file share / printers would just drop).

Local market troubleshooted all over the place, couldn't figure it out. Seniors on site, Cisco engineers looking at the full network. Ended up reverting to the old box. Eventually I got pulled in.

Customer is large enough and unhappy enough at this point that I was asked to fly in for two weeks to complete the migration project. All the standard troubleshooting has been done by the local market, so no need to check remotely.

On site (after a fun travel story of almost killing myself with a crappy rental in a blizzard), looked at the new box, tried to replicate the issue. Was able to see the SMB connectivity drop, pings would start flaking in and out at the same time. Just for kicks, rebooted with a ping still running ... and it didn't seem to drop during the reboot. Turned the server off ... still pinging. HTTPed to the IP, came back as a NAS.

Weeks of troubleshooting and customer downtime, and several thousand dollars in travel for me to fly in, drive 2.5 hours to get to the site, 2 weeks of hotel, for an IP conflict.

In the local market's defense, I think someone (likely network engineer) early on assumed it was a switching issue and went all-in on that.

Changed the IP of the server, worked through the rest of the migration with the client, went home a couple days early.",211,0,1

"If everything is exclaimed, nothing is","What is it with some users and exclamation marks? Do they really think everything they write is so important and urgent?

Every now and then, throughout various workplaces, I have encountered users who use exclamation marks as if they were just regular punctuation, or sometimes like commas. 

My most recent case was a ticket from a user titled ""can't log in!"". I opened it up to a description that read ""Can't log in to my account! Can't access VPN! Not working!!!""

In the 15 minutes that had passed since we received the ticket he had sent two more emails.

""Tried to change password! Can't get it to work! Fix this!""

""I heard that some departments use a new VPN! Why are they doing that! I only have the old one!!! What does this mean! I can't use VPN anymore!""

Apparently he also used the exclamation marks as question marks. 

""Calm down"" I thought to myself and rolled my eyes over how ridiculous this all looked and then took a quick look at his account. I notice that he *did* change his password less than 5 minutes ago. It seemed like ""Calm down"" was actually the solution to his problem. 

I sent of an email explaining that while some departments use a new VPN-client, his department is still using the old one. And then I ask if it's working now since I can see that he changed his password.

He responds that it is in fact working now. ""Apparently I had an unapproved symbol! You should change that so you can have any symbol!""

How much do you wanna bet that unapproved symbol was an exclamation mark?",192,0,1
Helping my friend on Google classroom,"So not a tech worker but did have to provide technical support to my friend, a bit of back ground, I'm 15 and my class has a required online course called celt, construction entry level training, this happened online.

I had already completed it and turned in my certificate, I was helping a friebd, she had finished it, this is how the conversation went.

Me: ok so go to your dashboard

Friend: can't I just go to achievements

Me: you can't download it from there go to dashbored, click on the three bars and go to training history.

Friend: so achievements

Me: training history friend

Friend: ok I'm there now what

Me: go to certificates

Friend: I'm on training history

Me: yes, there's a spot that says certificates click it, then click the printer symbol next to the name

Friend: ok I'm there

Me: now you should see the certificate, click the blue printer in the corner

Friend : ok I did

Me: it should say downloaded, click show in folder

Friend: but it's downloaded can't i put it in classroom 

Me: it downloaded to computer not the drive

Friend : it's not working it's not in my drive

Me: I told you that, click show in folder and move it from downloads to drive

Friend: it won't open

Me: refresh page, click the printer, and then click show in folder

"Maintenance guy ""fixed"" the copier and causes several thousand $'s in damage.","TL:DR - ""Maintenance"" guy thinks he's a copier tech, FUBARS several thousand $ of equipment and gives the office a toner makeover.

Back when I worked as a field repair tech our standard response time was get to the customer within 24 business hours. If you called in on a Friday late in the day, you'd most likely see me monday morning/noon. I think this story happened 2006ish.

We got a call from a doctors office on a Friday around 3pm saying the copier had an error message. Said error message was ""replace toner waste container"".

Normally this can be done by the end user but this particular MFP (multi function printer/copier) had one that had to be replaced by a tech. The copier they had used a waste container that could hold about 5lbs of waste toner and was held inside the machine in the back under some covers so a tech had to be dispatched to take things apart and do some general cleaning when these containers needed replaced.

Now this customer was a good hour and a half drive from dispatch so I called them and informed them I'd be up first thing Monday morning. Unfortunately this meant the MFP would be down till I got there but not much I could do unless they wanted to pay an after hours fee for me to get there same day. They said it was fine, they had other printers and would see me Monday. Cut to Monday morning and I walk into their  office and EVERYTHING (I do mean EVERYTHING) was covered in a fine black powdery film. It looked like someone dropped a toner bomb in their office.

M=Me
R=Receptionist
D=Doctor

M: What on earth happened in here?!?

R: Our building maintenance guy said he could take care of the error code on the copier and he tried fixing it Saturday.

M: How? What? What did he do?

R: He said the error code just meant the container inside the front cover was full and needed emptied. So he took a shop-vac and just sucked it out.

M: He did WHAT!!!

R: I guess it was fine for a few seconds then the vacuum started blowing black everywhere. We've been trying to clean up since Saturday but this stuff doesn't clean up easy.

Now for those not in the know on toner, it's a VERY fine silica based powder that clings to everything, best way to clean it up is with a static cloth (similar to a super cloth) or with a SPECIAL vacuum that has a filter designed to keep toner in it otherwise you get a cloud of black death. Also being silica based it does NOT mix with water so using a cloth or paper towel with water/cleaner just smears it around.

I glance at the disaster that is their office and immediately go back to my car, grab an entire pack of static wipes, a dust filtration mask, my vacuum, and a pair of latex gloves. Upon returning I instruct the girls in the office that they should all be wearing masks and gloves due to this film being silica based, then hand out the cloths and instruct them how to use them (give em a bit of a stretch and go to town).

M: Ok, I need to see exactly what your ""maintenance"" guy did to the copier. Give me a while to see what he did and get the outside of the copier cleaned up so I can work on it.

I look at the copier and its turned off at the front switch, most copier have 2 switches: One for a low power shutdown, the other for complete shutdown, I reach behind and fully kill the power. After about 15 minutes of wiping down covers, controls, and everything in general and I finally open up the copier. The ""container"" the maintenance guy vacuumed out was not the waste tank, it was in fact the developer unit...

Again for those not in the know, a copier mixes toner into a developing unit that is filled with developer (a very fine metal powder). So not only did the maintenance guy blast the office with toner he also manage to suck out ever speck of developer and made it airborne.

I cleaned everything I could on the copier inside and out and then figured it'd be safe to power up and see the extent of the damage. Upon power up I immediately got a developer unit error code, no surprise there, so I power down, completely clean the DV unit and toss in a new bottle of developer. Power back up and run the neccessary service codes to recalibrate the DV unit. On the next reboot I can hear everything running and doing its usual start up until i get a laser unit error.

*RUT ROH, that's not good*

I reset the error and reboot the copier listening to hear if the laser spins up and again, error code.

*well shit*

Normally you dont touch laser units unless you know theres something wrong with them, I figured toner got inside the unit and was causing issues. So I rip out the laser and take it apart, sure enough toner was inside it on the mirrors but what worried me was the motor that ran the refection head was hard as hell to turn. My first thought was if toner got in, developer probably did as well. So I pull the motor out and clean it with isopropyl, dried the crap out of it with compressed air, and lubed the bearings with a drop of oil. It was spinning smoother but still a bit rough. Put everything back together and prayed. This time I could hear the laser trying to spin up but it still kept throwing the error code.

I figured it was time to call the boss and inform him of the situation. As soon as I told him what the maintenance guy did and the error codes the machine was having he said pack it up the machine is dead and nothing's going to be covered by warranty or their service contract. Inform the Doctor what was happening and if they want a quote for a replacement we'll be happy to get him one. I went back inside and informed the receptionist I needed to speak with Doctor about the situation.


D: I'm told you wanted to speak to me?

M: Yeah Doc, unfortunately your copier is dead and my boss doesn't even want to attempt to fix it due to what the maintenance guy did. It definitely killed the laser unit and probably more but we cant find out till the laser is replaced and it's about $500-600 just for the laser. If it killed the laser most likely all the other motors in the copier are dead or dying since the laser is one of the  more protected sections in the machine. Unfortunately none of this is covered under your maintenance contract since someone outside our company caused the damage. We can get you a quote for a new one and get it here ASAP if you want but a replacement with the same features is gonna be several thousand dollars.

*I honestly thought the doctor was going to go ballistic at this but he floored me with the following.*

D: Ok, get me a quote, but I want a better machine then this one with a stapler and hole punch.

M: Ok...? You're not upset?

D: No I already informed the maintenance company that does the cleaning that they're paying for all damages in my office. I have their employee on camera doing something he's not supposed to do and I was not asked if I wanted him to work on my equipment. I told them if they had an issue with that my lawyer would be delivering paperwork sueing for damages. They said the guy  was fired and I should email over any quotes or bills for replacements/repairs. So I'm going to get an upgrade on their dime.

M: Ok... I'll have a quote to you by end of today.

D: I also have 3 computers that aren't working do you think that this could have caused them to stop working?

M: Oh absolutely, if toner and developer got sucked into them it could of ruined the harddrive or fans. Maybe even shorted something if enough developer got on the boards (I explained what toner and DV was).

D: Ok, my IT guys are supposed to be here later today so I'll just have them do the same and replace them. Is there anything else you needed?

M: No, I'll get packed up and have that quote emailed over.

D: Ok, thank you.

I returned to my stuff and started packing up, I explained to the receptionist what was going on and apologized for not being able to do much.

R: That's ok, thanks for these cloths though, we're actually getting stuff cleaned up now.

M: Well have a better day and I'd keep the masks and gloves on till your done cleaning. You can keep the pack of cloths, you're going to need them.


Thank god the maintenance guy didn't actually vaccum out the waste tank because the DV unit had at most about a little over 2 pounds of DV/toner if he'd have got the actual waste tank... they'd of been replacing everything in the office from carpet to ceiling tiles.",4084,1,1
"Sure, printer settings change on their own...","I'm not IT, I'm an electrician. But our IT team is understaffed so I tend to help them out with more misc tasks.

We have these huge industrial sterilization machines for pharma equipment. And whenever they complete a run, you have to print a protocoll and sign it. For that we have printers set up for every one of them.

Yesterday the IT team got calls that the printers aren't working. When I got there for my shift, they had been trying to get them running for 2 hours and couldnt figure out what was wrong. LAN didn't work. Direct cable connection didnt work. You couldn't ping the printers either. Paul (not his real name) was on it with his laptop trying all kinds of things that I'm not educated enough to understand, until he finally gave up and decided to just set up a new printer. 

Then my coworker and I got an idea. Apparently he never checked the printer settings. We have a lock on the display so no one can change settings but we thought hey,might as well try it. And well...someone turned off all the network and connection settings. We turned them on again, set the IP adress/subnetmask and standard gateway and voila the printers started to print again. We were just happy everything worked again but Paul was contemplating how the heck printer settings,that were locked, could change on their own.

She decided to replace the toner cartridges herself. Big mistake.,"I've only been in IT for two years, but today I stumbled into the most ridiculous user error I've seen yet.

A user, who I'll refer to as ""Audrey"", had very little toner remaining in her personal HP multi-functional printer, so I ordered in some new cartridges for her. It was one of each colour; CMYK. At their arrival, I placed them in her office and told her to let me know when the print quality starts to turn bad, and I'll replace the cartridges for her.

Some weeks later I go by her office and notice a bunch of toner cartridges strewn around her desk. ""Are these the old cartridges?"" I ask myself. I look at the printer supplies status and they're still low. ""Strange. Did she fail to replace them?"". I track her down and ask her what's going on with the toner situation.

Audrey: ""I messed it up. I broke them.""  
Me: ""How?""  
Audrey: ""I snapped something off.. on three of the cartridges.""

I'm thinking it was just some piece of plastic or something attached from the packaging, no big deal. After all, how could something so simple go wrong? You literally open and pull out a little shelf on the printer, take the old one out and put in the new one. This particular replacement procedure is one of the most straightforward designs I've seen on most printers.

We went to the office and she handed me one of the cartridges, along with the snapped piece. It was worse than I thought. It was the actual electronic chip that needs to be read by the printer to know the status of the toner. It wasn't even torn out as one whole piece, but **snapped in half**, and she had done this **three** times. Only the black toner survived.

Me: \*in disbelief\* Why did you do this?  
Audrey: The old toner didn't have that piece there, and the instructions said something about removing or pulling something off..

The old ones were HP toner cartridges, and I ordered Xerox ones. They were compatible, but had slightly different appearance. She was smart enough to remove the plastic guard, and she had pulled the tab for removing the protection strip, but somehow she thought the electronic chip had to go too, because it wasn't in the same spot as the HP brand cartridges?

Wherein a close friend struggles with both printers and a penny wise dollar foolish boss.,"Not about me, but one of my friends also in the IT business. 

He inherited admin status of a site which started out as 4 workstations and grew pretty haphazardly till he got a hold of it at 60 workstations and a slew of peripherals. 

The thing is, before he got there every department was basically given free reign to get whatever software and hardware that they wanted to do their job, within a certain budget. 

Meaning there was no cohesion at all, no standardization. 

He had 15 printers of an astounding array of makes and models, all with their own ink. 

Not even joking, an entire enclosed office was dedicated just for storing ink. 

And a lot of those printers were so old that the manufacturers didn't even make ink for them anymore, and he had to hunt ebay and refill services to fill requirements, and half of which was unusable on arrival due to age anyway. 

So one of his first projects was to standardize the printers. 

So he brought the owner two proposals for managed print services, with reasonable cost per page and good reviews. 

Owner looked at the numbers and rejected it, and told Friend to just go buy new printers. 

So he bought 15 HP Officejets and set them up. 

The remaining printers were specialty, such as wide format or impact printing. 

One type of printer, one type of ink, every department can use every other department's inks, and the cost per page is close to what a managed service would offer. 

Fast forward 3 months, and there is noticeable savings on consumables, and reduced downtime, and everyone is happy. 

Until...

Owner hears about refillable tanks from a fellow business owner (who has exactly 2 printers), and starts seeing more dollars he can trim off the bottom line, and orders my friend to implement it on all printers. 

&gt;Friend: That's not a good idea, at most you'll be saving maybe $30 a printer per month, and you run the risk of damaging the printheads. 

&gt;Owner: My buddy told me that was bs, and he's been running tanks for years with no problems. 

&gt;Friend: And your buddy has 2 printers and their already ancient to begin with so their printhead screens are big enough to let boulders through.

&gt;Owner: What does that have to do with it?

&gt;Friend: Modern printers have finer printhead screens, the ink needs to be a much higher quality than most refill places can handle, and the ones that _can_ do it will basically charge you what a retail cartridge would cost. 

&gt;Owner: Look, it's just ink. I know you're defensive about this project, but IT is a cost center and we need to reduce your department's drain as much as possible. 

Friend literally bit a decent scrap out of his inside cheek hearing this and kept having to swallow his own blood trickle for the rest of the 'talk'. 

&gt;Friend: Every printer that fails will come out of our pocket as they will not honor a warranty replacement caused by non-OEM ink, and they'll know we're using a tank even before the printer fails. They can't legally stop us from doing it, but they have spent more than a million dollars on software and research to make sure as fuck they know when we do. 

&gt;Owner: It's your job to keep it running, it's my job to decide how to pay for it, so bring me 3 proposals for tank systems by the end of the day and we will move forward with the best one. 

They chose a system, my friend installed it, and within two weeks the first printhead failed. 

Within a month 3 printers were down. 

&gt;Owner: Can't you just change the printheads? They can't be that expensive. 

&gt;Friend: The entire reason this printer is so fast and ink efficient is that it's a full page printer. The print head is actually 20% of the lower mechanism and it is not only not intended to be serviced by end users, replacing them is such a pain in the ass that HP just replaces the entire printer instead of trying to repair our existing one. But not in our case, because, you know, non-OEM ink...

&gt;Owner: Just reassign users on the broken printers to the closest working one to them, I'm not paying for replacements. 

Friend sighs and does as ordered. 

Within the next 5 months, a total of 9 out of 15 printers fail, employees are complaining about lining up at printers, getting the wrong print jobs, and having to walk a few more feet than they are normally used to. 

Of course all this hate comes squarely down on my friend's shoulders, and when your users hate IT, that's when things start to get really bad. 

Finally, close to a year after the tank swap, HP sends out a firmware update and support refuses to even work on a machine until the update is applied. 

So he applies the update. 

Within a week the remaining 6 all die mysteriously, all with print head failures. 

Now I'm not saying HP updated their firmware to brick non-OEM ink using printers, but that's a pretty short time to have 6 printers die at once. 

That said, they were in a bind, Owner blamed Friend, and then 'came to the rescue' with the idea of hiring a print management service, using all the datapoints and even the service provider that Friend had proposed during the initial plan. The department heads all comment how smart that is, and chide Friend for not thinking of that in the first place and putting everyone though all this trouble for his 'pet project'. 

Friend goes home and downs a handle of vodka because speaking up would cost his job.

Wish I had a happier ending for you all, but real life doesn't often play out like a story. 

There was no vindication for the one that put in the most effort to prevent the problem from ever happening.",290,0,1
The tale of the HVAC vendor mix up....,"List of characters:

&gt;Me: just-out-of-school system admin / network engineer  
&gt;  
&gt;Boss:  he's been out of the tech side for about 20 years but great people skills  
&gt;  
&gt;Senior network engineer: my mentor - great guy but hates documenting anything.  He's one of those ""rack it and toss the box and user manual away"" guys  
&gt;  
&gt;HVAC vendor: poor guy who doesn't understand why our shop is so unorganized. (I keep wondering that too!)

\-------------------------------------------------

Boss: ""Take photos of the racks and send it to our HVAC vendor so they can calculate our heatload.""

Me (confused because that didn't make sense): ""Sure.  I'll do it today. What's their email or phone number?""

(You may be asking why I said ""sure!"".  I've learned in my 2 months at this job that asking him clarifying questions is useless because he'll just dig in deeper, explaining why his instructions are correct. I know my next step is to go to the source and see what they actually needed.)

Boss gives me the rep's email address.  I email him, asking them to clarify what they need.  (And no, I didn't repeat my boss' instructions, hoping to save him some face.)

Of course, I miss their call - I was replacing a user's monitor that decided to output technicolor static.

Vendor, via voicemail: ""I talked to your boss last night.  I just need those photos and then I'm good.""

I left another voicemail and sent another email, adding my boss' instructions and asking if that was really what they needed.

I waited until lunchtime but got no reply, so  I went into the server room and did as instructed - took detailed photos of Rack #1 only and sent them with ""Is this really what you want?!?!?!""

THAT finally got them to call me back.

Vendor: ""We don't need photos of your racks.  We need photos of the nameplates!""

Me: ""Yeah, that's not going to happen.  Those nameplates are usually on the top or bottom of the equipment and we're racked up really tight in there.  I can't get a piece of paper in there, never mind my cell phone.  And no, I'm not unracking live equipment, no matter how much you beg.""

Vendor: ""Well, do you have an inventory or user manuals or something we can get information off of?""

Me (knowing my department has never been big on documentation): ""All I have is what you just got - photos of our racks.""

\*silence\*

I finally told them I'd figure something out for them and hung up.

I go to my senior network engineer, just in case there was a miracle, and asked him: ""The HVAC vendor wants to know what we have running in the server room so they can pull a better BTU calculation.  Do we have an inventory of what's on the racks?""

He stares at me like a dear stuck in headlights.

Me: ""I'll take that as a no...""

So, I spent most of my free time yesterday afternoon in the server room, pulling brand names and models off of the hardware in there.  Cord management isn't a big thing for our company either, so you can guess how much fun that was.  I'm hoping between my Googling skills and the vendor's research skills, we can come up with a decent BTU estimate for the new HVAC equipment.",244,0,1
"The Mini, The Pole And The Plant Pot...","My office is located at an activity centre in a rural area. Until relatively recently the only options for connectivity were ADSL lines (5mbit on a good day), Leased Lines (very expensive due to needing to pull fibre 16km/10 miles so it was never really an option) and ISDN/T1 services over copper. Then our local telco supplier started offering Fibre to the Premises connections for much less than what a leased line cost, so we went from our 5mbit ADSL to a 300/30mbit link and the world was a better place...

... That was until one afternoon, just before the long Easter weekend where I was planning on having a quiet time with family. I'd just finished walking the 1.5 mile /2.4km route home when I got a call from my boss saying ""Be warned, your office might call, they've lost their internet connection. They said something about an accident...""

Now, being the curious sort I got home, jumped in the car and headed back up to the office. Turns out the ""accident"" was an unfortunate person in a new type MINI Estate/Station Wagon, who'd managed to come together with a telephone pole. Quite a serious coming together in fact. The pole had been sheered off at the base, all the wiring ripped out and the pole deposited on the road. A right old mess of things.

Problem was, this telephone pole carried \*all\* of the site connectivity across a main/trunk road:

The FTTP Fibre  
The 12-line ISDN service  
And a 20-core cable that carried about 5 voice/ADSL lines

The only positives were that the driver of the MINI was unharmed and that there was one less MINI estate on the road. As there was no chance of getting services back that day I simply called our comms suppliers and headed for home.

The next day there was no sign of any telco response, so I plonked myself in the canteen (the only part of the building with mobile phone service) and worked via my laptop and a mobile data hotspot. The other issue was that all the site phone numbers had been forwarded to my mobile so I had to ""handle"" all communications for the site. I struggled on waiting for the telco to come out to repair things, and fortunately it was a pretty quiet few days.

Unfortunately, this repair seemed to be rather down the priority list for the telco. We got one chap who started fault finding one of the lines (which was with a different provider to the others). Problem was he was mystified he couldn't get a dial tone or anything on any of the lines. It was only by chance I saw him as I passed work in the car and pointed out that the cable for that line was currently buried in a hedge. I may have ruined his plan to claim Easter weekend overtime with that particular bit of information...

As the days wore on we started thinking of how to get some kind of connectivity back. The main issue with this site was that it was a converted manor house with very thick walls (so mobile service didn't penetrate the building). What this meant was that the only areas with mobile service were those with large glazed areas like the canteen. Fortunately the canteen had an AP mounted near the window with a power socket next to it. We then came up the idea of grabbing a 4G Based router that would take a corporate SIM, tuning it up to give the same IP range as out main router and plugging it in. All we had to do was find somewhere with signal to stash the router...

...Enter the random plant pots stacked along the windowsill. These were obivously located where there was plenty of sunlight, and a quick test with a mobile phone showed there was a decent signal available. We stuffed the router behind one of the plant pots (to discourage any playing with it), ran the cable up the wall to the AP's socket (near the ceiling), pulled the normal router/firewall out of service and we got back a very basic service level back. Luckily we had a couple of 3G femtocells so we could get mobile services working in the building and divert all the calls to someone else's mobile.

Now we thought we'd only need to do this for a couple of days until the telco got themselves sorted. Unfortunately the telco were in no hurry, and it took 2.5 weeks for us to get service back despite putting escalations and complaints through to everyone that anyone had a contact for. During this our supplier (who had to deal with telco) were getting reports and excuses. One excuse read, and I quote:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Unfortunately the company that is contracted to do the local replacement has had their site broken into, stock stolen and the vehicles vandalised.

So apparently they'd run out of service vans and/or spare poles! Of course, it would be cynical of me to suspect that the real reason was that a local council had just core drilled through the main fibre for North West Wales just up the road and they didn't have enough fibre repair techs available to do both jobs at once...

Anyways, the job was finally completed at the end of the 2.5 weeks with 8 telco vans, a pole erection truck a traffic light control team and a veritable army of techs. After an all-day job we finally had all the services back online (with nary a crossed pair in the 20-pair!). I dread to think how much it cost the driver's insurance, as a set of traffic lights on a trunk road is £1,000 on its own, plus £1,000 to replace a pole, plus 9 techs for the day, plus our compesnation claim for two weeks 4G use (suffice to say I've bought cheaper cars than that bill!).",162,0,1
I did the basic rookie mistake of not checking the previous tickets,"I had a ticket laying in the backlog, the ticket was described by the user like: ""I can't report invoices to the bank, excel is not working as it should. Files are opening automatically on their own. Before, there had been no such problems.""

As usual in the IT world, users don't really give much detailed information (blessed be the exceptions). And this user was no exception. When did it stop working, what they did before the issue popped up, what they tried to remedy the issue yadda yadda.

So yesterday I finally decided to call them after like 2 days of this ticket laying dormant (I just utterly hate excel tickets as they're the worst to solve), called them and connected remotely to the computer. I asked all sorts of questions needed to troubleshoot and told them, if the user could show me what they did.

The user naturally didn't really know any IT terms so they explained it to me as: ""I clicked here. This button. Then there's a document generated. But it opens up automatically in Excel, it should be like imported to the bank and confirmation email should arrive. I just drag the button and that's it. And when I got back to the browser, the button doesn't show.""

I had REALLY no idea. The user's description – even if they tried their best – was not really sufficient. I couldn't even comeup with a followup question besides ""where did the button appear?""

""Down.""

So I had to start somewhere right? I searched through our KBs if we have anything about that particular webapp. Nothing. Then I spent some time googling this shit. Nothing again. After 10-15 minutes, I finally began thinking about how to commit a suicide because this issue is not documented and I'm gonna be the first one and that this issue will be a very complicated one.

Then it hit me. As I was playing around the site, the site had a specific area called ""drag your documents here"". The user told me they ""just drag the button and that's it"". I connected the dots and I had the resolution. The webapp works in such a way that it generates a downloadable .csv report which then the user must manually import into the accounting system of the bank. Most of the work is done automatically, the user must only do one simple thing and that's it. But the user made a missclick and while the site was generating the report, the user checked the option ""always open files of this type after downloading"". Obviously, they would open in Excel first. Turns out that the ""button"" the user dragged was the file to be downloaded in Google Chrome.

Today, the same user has called me. The same problem. The same description. So I've searched through all of their tickets in order to find the number of the one I created yesterday so all I had to do was simply log a ticket and refer to the old one's solution. Besides mine, there were 4 other very old tickets with the same user and the same issue, all of them the same resolution.

If I only checked the previous tickets when I did the original callback. Don't do the same mistake. And I work for 10 months already at the service desk, I should have known better.",1304,0,1
"""I thought it would work right away"" not really...","Hello guys,

today I have a short story about my boss ($B). We don't really have inhouse IT so if there is a problem people contact me most of the time (I'm one of the only guys who know a bit about IT related stuff).

It was a quiet morning and everything seemed to be fine. Then out of nowhere $B rushed into my office.

$B: Hey, so I have an important webinar in like 2 minutes (!) and it does not seem to work. Could you help  me out? (the webinar is like 500€)

Me: Sure! 

\*We go to her office and I check her pc\*

Me: The software is not installed, but it will work in your browser. Did you check your sound settings?

$B: No, it should work I think.

\*I check the back of her PC and there is no aux cable\*

Me: It will not work as there is no aux cable. You got one when the new pc's arrived. Where is it?

$B: I don't know!

\*So I wasted the next 15 min looking for a damn AUX cable, but thank god I found one and connected her PC to her Screen as there are no external speakers. It seemed to work but it did sound pretty bad.\*

$B: I can't hear them properly, could you fix that pls?

Me: No I can not, the speakers in your screen are bad and there is nothing I can do about it. You would need external speakers. (I should'nt have said that)

$B: Could you look for some speakers?

Me: There are no external speakers here, believe me. (There is one guy who has them, but I don't want to crawl under his desk to pull the cable and sort them out as it is a fkin mess)

$B: Ok fine... the webinar is nearly over now. Why did it not work in the first place? I thought it would work right away!!

I was pretty pissed because all she had to do was to test her setup BEFORE the webinar to avoid this.",1019,0,1
No. Just no.,"Hey guys!

I'm back again!

So, here's the latest from my little world of server support.

I got a call from a very, very large fashion company. CPU voltage error. No big deal, it's something I could take care of in my sleep.

&gt;""Do we have logs from the server you can provide?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""No, I don't, and I'm not even sure if the LOM is configured.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""No worries, that CPU voltage error is generally resolved by firmware updates. Can we do that?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Not right now, no, I can't make any changes without a series of change requests. But let me go see if we can do that.""

So a few days go by, and I get an email explaining that they can't do the updates because a monitor didn't work when connected to their system, and they wanted one of our techs to come out and troubleshoot that as well as run the firmware updates.

So I very clearly let them know that what they're asking for is generally done by one of their folks, and if they want one of our techs to do it, it would be an additional charge.

So I expected them to refuse to pay and just send one of their guys out. They didn't. So I quoted them the price, but it wouldn't let me finish because the system was actually registered to the reseller said fashion company bought it from. I could see the price, though, so I told them around how much it would be, and told them they need to complete an ownership change before I can complete it.

So another day goes by, and I come into an email telling me that there would be no ownership change, and we need to set it up such that the US arm of the fashion company would pay for the quote.

Now, I don't know if you guys can read, but I said a paragraph up that I couldn't complete the quote, and that they need to change ownership before I can do that. Evidently, despite being told this very thing, they think I can just make us charge the US branch of their company for an addition to a server's warranty that, according to our system....they don't own.

Updates to come, I figure you guys will appreciate it.",949,0,1
A Tail as Old as Thyme.,"So I work for a large Medical Healthcare Group, which owns and operates hospitals over several states. I got a message from my supervisor this morning. He asks if I have been to MainStreet Outpatient Care. In fact I live within fifteen minutes of them, and pass them on my way home from work each day. 

My supervisor explains that their new, very expensive label printer is not working. They have been on the phone with tier 1 for an hour and a half, and want a tech on site. Now this printer handles printing of labels, scripts, and a bunch of other vital things. It also cost more than some vehicals. 

Sure. no problem. Got it boss. I grab my kit and head on over. Once on site, I see the printer all hooked up, with a nice long string of printed labels, which nurses are busy applying to samples of all sorts of things. Inwas initially confused, as I thought the printer wasn't working.

I am greeted by the head nurse, who explains the vast importance of this printer, and how they must have it repaired immediately, without any cost or downtime. They can't afford the time or money for a replacement. They need a #PermenentSolution and they need one now. 

I go through the basics. Cables, power, settings, are all good. The network tests well. The printer reports the proper ip address and I can connect to it via IP, no problem. Internal settings are all perfect. The printer drivers on the controlling computer are all up to date. I do some test prints. All work fine. The printer reports everything is ready to go. 

I ask the staff to push a label to the printer through their workflow software... Nothing. 

It turns our that the print works perfectly... if you ask it to reprint a label. Normally the labels are automatically entered when the patient is registered as needing lab work. When that hits the system, connections are made, things are recorded, numbers drawn up, and a label with all the particulars is supposed to print. A nurse then collects the appropriate container for whatever is going to be collected, slaps the label on. And hands it off to the nurse who is doing the collecting. A simple and smooth process that is ruined by the fact that the printer won't print until someone clicks the small warning icon and selects ""reprint"".

This is a disaster reaching apocalyptic proportions. I double check everything. I check the workflow software. I check the printer settings. I even check the cables again... and then I see it. 

That error message, the one that shows up when the label is generated, says that it can't find the printer. But it specifically says it can't find ""ManeStreetPrinter-01"" Mane Street. MANE Street. A quick change of the name of the printer in the workflow software, and there is suddenly a flood of labels.

These last phew daze have maid four an interesting weak.",883,0,1
Scholarly Mainframe Hijinks,"All of this recent VAXery has me remembering fondly of my father teaching me ZORK and KINGDOM on the university mainframe. Sitting late at night in the main office, staring at an old amber monitor, completely absorbed in the fate of an ASCII hero, as my father toiled away over statistical models on the neighboring terminal.

This is not my tale. It is a tribute to tales told to me by my father.

My father, aged and very much retired, was a professor of Political Science back in the days when statistical analysis was mostly theoretical. Old enough to predate Blalock's seminal publishing on the topic. Likewise, mainframes back then were the Big Iron joy that I know several of you suspender'd ancients toiled over hot registers on.

I'm not saying he predated cardboard, but I fairly sure he was around to see the first punchcard be smithed out of it.

Dad was (and is, still) an empiricist. He gets very grumpy with the reverse. Real-world proof beats hypothetical wishery 99.9% of the time, error margin of &lt;0.001%, he maintains to this day. Before Big Iron, he'd do all of his analysis by hand. Giant stacks of yellow foolscap paper pads, all with meticulously plotted equations.

Dad did multivariate regression by hand. God save him.

So when the university said ""we're buying one of those newfangled electronic computer thingies"", Dad pestered everyone up to the Dean (according to departmental peers) to make sure his department got time on the schedule.

Dad taught himself to program. Dad taught himself to load programs by punchcard. Dad badgered the departmental chairman into buying their own punchcard type-machine, and then apparently horded it in his office until it was stolen one night by his peers. This began a game of equipment hot-potato, as the punch-writer made the rounds of people's offices, desk, file cabinets and the like until the chairman put their foot down and had it chained to a desk in the main office.

Apparently, akin to the military, there is only one thief, everyone else is just trying to get the punch-writer back.

For his part in the above, Dad had to help the entire department learn to program and to use the punchcard-writer. Thus where the hijinks begin.

As time has gone on, I have come to realize that nerds are nerds no matter the discipline. Mild sociopathery included. Dad's peers took to programming like fish to water, and mainframe access to hyenas to fresh meat. They learnt that the early sessions could be 'preempted' from other terminal sessions. They learnt that the early email structures could be tampered with. 

In one case, one of Dad's peers had built a very specific punchcard, that when inserted anywhere into a stack of punchcards, would instruct the mainframe to diagonally stripe-print messages over any output.

The thought of what got printed, I leave up to you. Keep in mind that for all their learn'ed, scholarly gravitas, many professors are still schoolkids at heart, and swear like sailors (just in N languages, usually).

In addition, said peer was the departmental jester. For all of you in IT, consider the terror this could engender when the class clown also programs at a reasonably skilled level.

Having met the man in question, I would never have guessed it for he was a very nice man I thought, and Dad, for his part, mentioned but a few situations involving data-pranks that were ascribed to him, if not conclusively proven. The one I recall the most clearly was Dad mentioning that, late in one summer, he once had to stay up for almost an entire weekend straight, guarding the punchcard reader, to make sure the sixth copy of a governmentally-commissioned report did not go out to a minister with commentary striped across it discussing current governmental policy, the mental attributes of the current council, and the size and capability of the minister's unmentionables. 

For someone, with a special card, had been working their magic the entire previous week. To the point of enlisting peers to distract Dad so some quick slight-of-hand would render several hours of output rather, well, George Carlin-esque. Deadlines being deadlines, Dad apparently complained loudly enough to the chairman to ensure that the chairman spoke with said jester.

Later, the chairman told Dad that he had secured through threats and promises that a certain someone would not be in the office over the weekend, so he had all that time to do said work. Dad said he then asked he the chairman had taken a peer's office keys from him for said weekend. The chairman replied with words to the effect of ""That's insulting, I wouldn't do that. It'll be fine.""

So Dad camped out the entire weekend.

On Monday, Dad arrived at the office. Tired, grumpy, but joyful, for the printing had been done. His peer was in the office that morning, and Dad related how he triumphantly finished his work, without his peers commentary either! His peer congratulated him, and then asked which of the 300-level classes he'd be teaching in the fall. Dad, for his part, who had recently ducked out on those courses due to seniority, asked for clarification, to wit his peer explained that on the previous Friday, the chairman had come by to plead Dad's case. 

His peer listened, and explained that he'd never tamper with Dad's output like such, and that he'd be fine with sharing the computer access, but that since he'd lost out to Dad on course-assignments for that Fall, he was planning on re-writing his assigned 300-level coursework over the weekend and they'd share the terminal access. A discussion ensued, and having plead his case (and noted that Dad still had the previous year's coursework available), extracted a promise from the chairman to redo the course assignments, and furthermore, that in return, he'd ensure that he never set foot into the office the entire weekend. So he'd left town for the entire weekend for his lakeside cottage.",113,0,1
Outsourced employee making a series of wrongdoings that leads to loosing the job.,"My company during the pandemic and summer vacation times outsourced alot of tech support jobs.  
These externals usually screw up quite often, but they are not doing it by purpose and these screwups aren't really catastrophic. Now, this time this wasn't a regular case of ""i had a poor intro education for the job so i didn't know any better"", this is something that lead to a person loosing the job.

A regular day, a regular call came in, it was at first a regular case.  
The customer needed help finding the Lan socket the customer will connect the router to, easily enough i helped them find it and the link poped up green on the routers wan socket. Great! i thought, easy, clean and another happy customer.

Then the internet didn't work, the customer was redirected to a website to buy a connection.  
Now this was a city network i didn't have systems for, and i started looking through the installation details, this is where i started to notice something odd.

I asked.  
Me: You mentioned you had moved recently, is that correct?  
C: Yes, we just moved in and we talked to you (reffering to my company) about this about a week ago.  
Me: I understand. Have you recently recieved an confirmation email for an order?  
C: No.. i thought that was odd, usually you get those.

Now i started understanding what has happened and went into the order system to look at the details.  
When the customer called in 27th may they got a 12month deal on the broadband connection, making them bound to us for 12 months. Then 4th sep they called us to move the connection because they are bound to my company due to the deal. The external that took the call and instead of just simply pressing one button to move the connection from one adress to another. This external removed the old connection completely. Then ordering a new connection.

Now, this is wrong on so many levels i have to make a list to count them.

1: Ordering a new subscription on a regular move case customer.  
2: Removing the old subscription manually by termination of the old terms to the binding deal from 27th of may. (Like a regular termination but with the debut of the remaining binding time).  
3: Ordered the wrong deal to the new adress for the customer.  
4: Didn't correct the new binding time of the new subscription to match the old binding time, effectivly increasing the binding time effect for the customer by about 4 months with the wrong deal.  
5: Didn't remove the debute of the remaining binding time from the old subscription. Making the customer get an invoice of about 300$.  
6: Didn't remove the installation fee of about 30$.  
7: Removed the need for the customer to return the router which the customer hired from my company manually, but didn't remove the mailing of a router which comes as a standard to enw customers (there is a button to remove it).  
8: Didn't give the customer any information about the binding time, new price, installation date, installation invoice, new router, how to connect the router on the new adress that has a lan socket instead of a fiber converter.

It took me about 1.5 hours to correct all this. So i got a bit salty because this was not a regular misstake, this was in purpose just to be able to klick a new subscription sale. Plus all of this could be avoided by just doing a regular move that would take about 2min to do (But no sale).  
I emailed the boss to this external and gave the boss a breif and asked the boss to look at the case.  
Two days passed and the boss thanked me for the information and told me actions had been taken accordingly to the case.

I looked up this external's employee ID and saw that it was inactive since 26hrs ago.  
This means that the ID is no longer in use and the external does no longer work for the company that we outsourced to.  
This was a bit odd, because in my country its rare and hard to be kicked out like that, it would take several offenses before actions like that would be taken. So i guess that this person had done similar things before, well, have fun finding a new job!

&amp;#x200B;

Ps: I very rarely report employees, but if something is blatantly obvious that the employee screw over the customer and break about every rutine and company rule just for a sale. I will go out of my way to make that person regret it.",408,0,1
But it won’t go away,"About 20+ years ago, I worked as tech support for a telephone company. At this time caller Id and internal voicemail were new and most folks didn’t have a clue how to use them. The team I worked on (about 30 people) were constantly training to keep up with the changes.  I had worked for this company about a year and I loved it. Every day there was a different problem to solve.  
A couple days after Christmas, I received a call from an older gentleman.
Me: Thank you for calling (company name) my name is (me) how may I assist you?
Customer: Hello?? Are you real or that computer voice again?
Now I’m very used to this response due to the fact that my professional “phone” voice sounds similar to the computerized voice on the choice menu the customers have to navigate to reach me.
Me: (chuckling) At last check I was human.
Customer: I need help with this caller Id my granddaughter got me for Christmas. 
Me: I’ll be more than happy to help you with this, first let me check that we have the service on your line.
Customer: I called customer service the day after Christmas and had it added.
Me: (after verifying that the service was active) How May I help you, Sir?
Customer: Well I’m getting calls but I can’t see who’s calling. It’s like the letters and numbers are all scrambled. 
Me: Oh, that’s not good. Let’s just go through a couple of tests here. 
I take him through making sure the box is connected correctly (it is), making sure the language is set to English (it is), and everything else I can think of. I even got the manual out to check if there was anything I might be missing. There wasn’t.
After thirty minutes of attempting to help this customer (I even called repair dept to ask for assistance and they were no help) I was as frustrated as the customer.
After speaking with the customer for a few more minutes it finally dawned on me what was wrong.
Me: Sir, would you do something for me?
Customer: Throw this darn thing against the wall?
Me: No sir. On the top right side of the display, would you please see if the display sticker is still attached.
The customer was silent for a few seconds.
Customer: Would you like me to bend over now so you can kick me?
Me: (lol) Inly is you kick me first.
Customer: Thank you for all your help.
Me: My pleasure. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Customer: Actually would you mind (he said sheepishly) recording the outgoing message on my voicemail? I really liked that computer voice you used.
I was more than happy to help him and he hung up a happy customer.",391,0,1
User reported me to my boss for not telling her to copy her shortcuts to the shared drive,"I'm the lowest person on the totem at work, so I have the job of hunting down and upgrading the last of the Win7 computers in our organization.  Since many of these computers are ancient, we're replacing them with brand new computers straight from Dell.  This process ran well for most users and they are usually VERY happy with the upgrade....but today was different.

Today's user was in accounting.  She seemed a little wary about this whole procedure when I called her the week before.  The usual conversation happened - how many monitors do you have? what apps do you use?  when are you avail this week or next? etc etc.  One of the most important parts of this conversation was, ""If you have any files saved on your computer, you need to move them to the shared drive.  This include anything on the desktop or in your documents or download folder you want to keep because once your old computer is returned to the IT department, it will be tossed in the recycle pile, never to been seen again.""  She seemed to grasp the idea and even asked me, ""Everything?  All my documents and spreadsheets?""  ""Everything.""

I stopped by her office this morning with the Dell box and switched out her very ancient computer with a brand new one.  I added her printers, gave her a quick tutorial on Win10, made sure she had all her applications, and then headed back to my lair in the IT office.  

She called me an hour later, upset: 

User: ""Where are my shortcuts?""  

Me: ""I'm sorry.  What shortcuts?""  

User: ""The shortcuts on my desktop!  They're all gone!  What did you do to them?""

Me: ""Were these shortcuts on the desktop of your old computer?""

User: ""Yes!""

Me: ""You didn't copy them to the shared drive?""

User: ""You told me to copy all my files, not my shortcuts!  I thought they'd be on there when I booted up but they're not!""

After a moment of ""WTF, lady!?!?!?"", I calmly told her I'd be over in a few minutes to help her out.  I knew that kind of ""special user"" was going to need a little hand holding and she was so pissed off, trying to remote in to fix the problem would only escalate the problem.  Once in her office, I apologized for the mixup and showed her how to add shortcuts to her desktop.  After 10 minutes of instructions (because she wanted to do it all herself), she had all of her shortcuts back.  I made sure she was happy with her new computer (she was), wished her a happy Tuesday and headed back to my office to get the next imaged computer.

My boss stopped me in the hallway an hour later.  

Boss: ""I got a call from 'user'.  She had a complaint about you.""

Me: ""Was it because I told her to save all of her files to the shared drive but didn't tell her to save her shortcuts there too?""

Boss: ""Exactly.  Got anything to say for yourself?""  (He's joking, of course.)

Me: ""I'm a BAD system admin and should be locked in my quiet cubicle to never deal with desktop support ever again?""

Boss: ""Like that's ever going to happen.  ((I'm the only system admin that has customer service background so I know how to deal with the grumpiest of users.)) 

Me: ""I learned my lesson.  In the future, I will tell people to move their files AND shortcuts to the shared drive.""

Boss: ""Bingo.  And don't worry about 'user''s complaint.  She's one of those people who think they know how to use technology but really don't.  The important thing is that you followed through and fixed the issue for her.""",2728,0,1
"Forklift, VAX. VAX, forklift. *CRUNCH*","A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ikz5ws/the_time_we_crashed_a_vax_by_osmosis/) by /u/AdoptsDEATHsCats reminded me of this.  This isn't my story; it's a story that [University Boss](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8l22x7/the_worst_epidemic_of_component_failures_ever/) told me many times.  Always accompanied by his jubilant, loud laugh.

Back in the day when floppies were still floppy, the university purchased a shiny new [VAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX).  It cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and was basically the size of several racks.  The hard drive was the size of a washing machine, [something like this](http://gunkies.org/wiki/RM80).

So these components arrive at the University by freight carrier on pallets.  From there, the union contract for physical plant stipulated that they must do the moving into position.  (I've also [written about them](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8i7whk/network_enlightenment_with_a_borderlineillegal/) before).

There sat the VAX, on pallets, by the wall in the warehouse.

The driver got on the forklift.  He drove towards the VAX as he usually did: fast, with the fork lowering towards the ground as he went.  He was probably annoyed at all the interest in it, and treated it like he did anything else: with as much care as one treats a pallet of cat litter.

At this point, I need to describe how University Boss would tell the story.  He'd gesture with his hands: one representing the VAX, and the other moving towards it, lowering slowly.

""So the forklift was driving towards the VAX, the fork was lowering, and then....  CRUNCH!   Hahahaha!""

Yes, the forklift encountered VAX before the fork encountered the ground.  It rapidly installed two large holes in the VAX - right through the [backplane](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/VAX_11_780_CPU_Backplane.jpg).  And when University Boss told the story, his laughter could be heard down the corridor -- despite the closed door to his office.

That may have been the most expensive second or two in the history of the university.

----
They eventually got the broken bits replaced and the VAX installed.  At one point while I was working there in the late 90s, I asked my boss to show it to me.  It still sat, powered down, in a now-dark server room.  Apparently they had finished the server room after the VAX was installed, and the doorway wasn't large enough to get it back out.  It remained there for several more years until that building got a renovation.",334,0,1
The Supervisor Tries To IT,"Hello everyone, I have a few stories I've wanted to share over the years, but this one happened earlier today and I needed to share it. Currently, I'm the technical lead for a major pharmacy company that does mail order prescriptions on a giant, automated system. I've got some stories working for the photography and tourism industry that I'd love to share later as well.

So tonight, one of my site supervisors calls me up and asks me to come to the little admin station within the facility where the workers on the line do their thing. It's just two tables with several monitors and docking stations for their #CorporateLaptops can dock into. Previously, we had the Vendor that manages the software and hardware of the system in and they had taken over this area. Walking up, the conversation goes roughly as follows :

$Supe1: Hey A\_Firestrawn, can you help me with something.

$Me: Sure $Supe1, what's going on?

$Supe1: So, I'm trying to set up the docking station for $Supe2, but I can't get the monitor to work. Can you take a look at it?

$Me: Absolutely!

So I go take a look, and I notice two very important details. 1) The Display Port cable is NOT plugged into the monitor. 2) The Docking Station appears to have 2 cables plugged into it. For all of us, we can all guess what had happened.

$Me: Hey $Supe1, I found your problem.

I say this as I begin uncoiling the single Display Port cable to show that both ends of the same cable were plugged into the docking station. $Supe1 and I share a laugh, and I inform them that they will never live this down.",836,0,1
An interesting Data Archive,"So, back when I was an apprentice in an IT Office, there was this lady who had a very questionable request. Basicly, she calls in, and tells me to clean up her Desktop after she is done with work. Totally okay with that and questioning my life choices, I connect to her Desktop with Remotedesktop and a vpn tunnel. I delete some shortcuts that are double, put some stuff in new folders, create a shortcut to their network attached storage and finally, I empty her recycle bin.

1 day later I get an angry call. Asking me whats wrong with me and how I can be so reckless. Asking my self, what I may have done wrong in her eyes since the task was literally for toddlers, she tells me that she had important recipes and contracts IN HER RECYCLE BIN. Work for several months just got deleted. I then explained to her, what the recycle bins purpose is and that its generally not a good Idea to keep stuff in there, since if someone by accident emptys it everything is gone. I went ahead and tried to explain how to properly hide stuff on your C drive with folders, but she wouldnt listen and not even let me talk. She told me that she would contact a Lawyer and sue me etc etc. Luckily, the PC goes through a Backup Everyday, so I could restore her Recycle Bin. Now the lady happily still uses her recycle bin for important files.

"When sales promise thousands of e-mails, per day, for her thousands of ""friends""...","Hello again everyone, hope your all &amp; well during the hump day as they call it! I posted a couple of day's ago regarding a customer and their e-mail issue:

[A decade worth of e-mails all gone, by the simple non clicking of a box, life is fun innit?](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/io5oqn/a_decade_worth_of_emails_all_gone_by_the_simple/)

Not all my tales to tell are e-mail related, but I had that one plus this one to share!

**Background:**

At the age of 36 I live in my home town in Scotland where I was born and grew up, went to school and have my current job in retail for nearly four years now. This tale, amongst others that follow in this subreddit are from my job before this, where I worked in a callcentre for a national broadband, phone &amp; tv provider. I was in the business faults for broadband/phone line dealing with customers either on the phone or live chat over the 10 and a half years I was there before I was let go (that is a story for another time) - this story is from at some point whilst working there. It's worth keeping in mind that any names of customers, me and the company I did work for have been changed obviously to protect identities.

**Cast:**

**Scotch:** Well, take a wild guess smart guy ;)

**MC:** Mis-Guided Customer

**COM:** Chilled Out Manager

**The Story:**

This was around mid to late 2011, I was on the front line technical support desk for \*shitty ISP\* before I was moved to the back office team I got this call from a customer.

*\*beep for the call\**

**Scotch:** Welcome to &lt;telco's business support line&gt; my name is Scotch, who am I speaking to today and how can I help?

**MC:** Hi, my name is MC and I have a simple query regarding your e-mail services, as I am recent sign up for your business account for one month but I am not able to send any?

**Scotch:** Sure, let me get some account details from you and lets see if we can get the problem fixed for you today MC.

*\*does account verification\**

**Scotch:** Thanks, from what I can see the account appears to be active, no barring or suspension from billings &amp; checking out outage board I see no outages for e-mail. Additionally my previous customer I dealt with had e-mail issues *(not the previous tale incase you are all wondering - this took place much later)* and by the end they where able to send. Talk me through how you send your e-mails so that I can see if we can fix it?

**MC:** I use *\*insert free to use ISP provided e-mail service\** and I was able to send OK, I use Microsoft Outlook - the full suite which I spent a bit of money from. I am getting some error messages on screen when I go to send them, I don't know what they mean.

**Scotch:** *(knowing that some customers don't know much about errors or are the best at relaying them over correctly to us)* What I would like to do is use to remote software to check out your setup there and see if we can resolve this today?

*Customer agree's to this and I get remoted into their machine, realising that they are using Windows 7, up to date and their using McAfee software, up to date and Windows Updates are fine.*

**Scotch:** After checking your system, it appears to be nothing your end, looking at the error message on screen it looks like to be an apparent blacklisting type error - if you give me a few minutes I am wanting to check out a things here for you. I will now disconnect from your screen now.

*As I check out her IP address, e-mail account on our end, with our mail suppliers etc...customer advises below.*

**MC:** No worries, you see when I signed up I told the sales guy's that I would be using this e-mail service to mail out my customers every day sales offers and vouchers with additional marketing information. I have thousands of followers on Facebook alone in addition to twitter *(this was before the day's of Instagram, influencers and spam e-mails died out)* so we are talking about a lot of e-mails I send, you see.

*By this point I had finished checking our blacklisting services and those of errors - if you have not guessed so by now I was able to see that she indeed had been blacklisted. Satisfied that it was not a virus on her computer sending out the spam, hijacked account or other problem, in addition to what she told me, I was braced for the fun of explaining this to her.*

**Scotch:** I understand completly **MC** about your situation, what I have been able to find out is that your mail account has been blacklisted on a couple of mail services online. Essentially what that means is that its a bit like someone going to a supermarket for their shopping then getting barred from entering, no longer being able to get inside anymore. Your e-mail account is the same, to a certain aspect, when you go to send your e-mails, we check your e-mail address and see that's it being stopped from sending to anyone - that's why you are not being able to send.

**MC:** WHAT?!?!?! I AM PAYING FOR A BUSINESS SERVICE, I AM A BUSINESS CUSTOMER PAYING FOR A PREMIUM SERVICE!!

*\*dreading how she will take the next info I was going to tell her\**

**Scotch:** I can confirm your account is our business account, yes, though the e-mail account you are using is the free to use one from \*shitty ISP\* that is only a basic e-mail account with limited features &amp; functionalities, One of the limits is that you can only send 200 e-mails per day, maximum with it. Additionally, if you are going to be sending that many e-mails per day, every day, for as you say marketing purposes, not just \*shitty ISP\* but other providers will see that as spam as well, due to the content of it. 

**MC:** but...but..I WAS PROMISED BUSINESS GRADE E=MAIL SERVICES THAT WHERE DYNAMIC, BACKED UP DAILY AND PROGRESSIVE!!!!

*For those who have ready my previous story know that at that time, backup services where not.a thing we done at that time, plus I am guessing sales used these buzzwords to ""Whooo"" her. At that time it was only a basic Outlook Web Access style system \*shitty ISP\* offered, before fully going over to Office 365 Premium with all these belts and whistles a few years later - so there was no other choice for the customer.*

**MC:** MY business needs these e-mails to survive, how am I meant o e-mail my thousands of followers and friends with deals and offers? You do realise that this is going to cost me money?

**Scotch:** For the information that sales gave you, I am sorry **MC,** truly I am - though without listening to the call I can't fully answer for what they said. In regards to the facts of the matter, what we can provide to you, the e-mail account is a basic mail account, as mentioned, with limitations on it. If we where to open it up to a fully featured exchange style service that you are looking for, not only would it cost \*shitty ISP\* thousands, but slow our services down for everyone. That is why we have these limits on them, which sales are fully aware of, to which I will feed this back to them, moving forward for you **MC,** the only thing that I can suggest is that you either use the social media platforms you mentioned to promote your business or going for a third party provider that offers exchange styled services. With more people using social media, compared to using traditional e-mail, you may hit your target audience better with that - but not through your current setup.

*I hear a few ""sums"" and ""ahs"" whilst she thinks over a few things.*

**MC:** *a bit downhearted after realising that she was lied too* \- Well thank you **Scotch** for explaining this too me - I just wish sales where honest and not lied to me, it's a shame that it went to this though I am sure there is something more that can be done? Can you put me through to a manager so I can discuss this further?

**Scotch:** I will certainly get through to a manager for you, to discuss this - though they may advise of the same mentioned earlier in the call. Please give me a few moments.

*I spoke to* ***COM (Chilled Out Manager)*** *about this - who was one of my previous managers, who was covering for someone and just happened to be in the next bay. He advised me to put the notes into the case for him, pass over the customer and leave it to him.*

**Scotch:** Ok there, I have spoken to my manager &amp; his name is **COM** \- he will take over for you.

*I passed the customer to the manager updating the case notes and went to do with other customers. It was a busy day, a few things and meetings happened - it was not until about three hours later before I caught up with him.*

**Scotch:** So, what happened to that customer then?

**COM:** Yeah, what a weird case eh? Well I spoke to the customer and advised them that we could not support her e-mail needs for what she needs, that she would be better off using the social media platforms for promotional materials. Who thinks that sending thousands of e-mails per day to people she does not know  is a good business idea anyway lol? Hopefully she will get something. 

**Scotch:** Yeah, she was mis-guided in her ideas on what e-mails where capable of and also by our sales team - not a good mix, but hopefully after us both telling her about using the social media platforms she will take that forward.

**COM:** I agree - did you put through the request for her account to be removed from black listings? I advised we done so, that it can take around 48 hours for the changes to take effect, for e-mail services to resume and use as normal? I also gave her credit for 6 months on her account for this (managers can do this - I could not).

**Scotch:** When I done the notes, I put through the request - thanks again boss man :)

**Random**

What made me choose this particular story over others? The previous one kinda sparked some memories of previous tales which I will tell in future, but also in the past week I learned that **COM** had passed away with cancer - it was all of a sudden, 10 day's from being diagnosed to dying leaving behind a wife and family. I will share other tales that feature him in the future, but this was the first that sprung to mind.

**TLDR: Sitting by the wooden fire, my flask of Whisky and meal of haggis, I sit there pondering the meaning of life in general, when I need to go post thousands &amp; thousands of letters through the letterbox's of my village because they once liked my social media page...I hope my moose is ready for this!**",150,0,1
You aren't supposed to reuse those...,"Hey everyone,

I've been enjoying the posts in this sub for several weeks now and wanted to share one of my own tales. TL;DR at the bottom. This one is from about a decade ago when I was working as a dedicated printer technician for a small family own MSP in the Chicagoland area. The owners were good people, and if someone called in a problem that could be solved by changing out a toner cartridge or cleaning the ADF glass we would advise them to do so and save on the $129 minimum charge for us to come out. This typically resulted in winning over a long term customer, so the good practice had good results. 

This particular call the customer had spent over a thousand dollars trying to fix a problem that was caused by trying to save a few cents on purchasing new labels.

The user calls (a new customer) calls in because her HP LaserJet 4200/4250 is putting repeated marks down the page while printing. I advise her that it sounds like a bad cartridge, but she insists that she has just put a new cartridge in and it is still having the same problem. I advise her of the minimum charge, and she requests us to come out.

I dispatch shortly after and get on site. After printing out a test page and seeing what is clearly a label mark on the page. I immediately pull the cartridge out to find the guilty label firmly stuck to the toner drum and show it to her. She gives me a sheepish look and insists that it is brand new. I assure her that it happens all the time, clean the drum of all of the adhesive, slap it back in, and print off another page to make sure that we are all good.

Except the same pages looked the same. Better than before, but still with a label mark going down the page three times.

I pull the fuser out and find another label, except this one was melted to the fuser film. I tried to clean it off, but the film was toast.

I advise her that unfortunately, her printer will require a new fuser (a $350-400 repair if memory serves right). It is then that she tells me that the fuser has already been replaced twice this month by a previous company, which is why she called us. **Ouch**. The fuser that was in it was rebuilt (which were notorious for being bad) and I recommended that we install an OEM fuser to fix the problem. She was extremely reluctant to agree because of the amount of money that had already been put into repairs, but I showed her that replacing the fuser fixed the problem, and she eventually agreed to give the go-ahead. 

While I was doing the repair though and cleaning out the paper path of a bunch of adhesive junk throughout it, something just didn't seem right. This reoccurring label problem didn't seem to be the fault of two poorly rebuilt fusers. She had been using tray 2 to print labels (This model was notorious for jamming with anything other than plain paper in tray 2) so I advised going forward to only use the manual tray and hopefully avoid the problem and expensive repair in the future.

We printed several test pages that all looked great and everything seemed all set to go. I was all packed up and about to leave when I saw it happen.  She was taking the label sheet that she had just printed with and feeding it back into the printer to print on the unused labels. The common denominator had revealed itself!

I asked her about what she was doing, and she informed me that she only printed one or two addresses at a time, so to save money, she would reuse a sheet of labels until it was empty. I was shocked. It was such good intentions, but I had to explain to her about the toner fusing process, and as a byproduct, that she had just cost her company over a thousand dollars with three separate fuser installs by trying to save a few cents on new labels.

Moral of the story? Don't let your end-users reuse labels.

**TL;DR:** End-user tries to save her company by reusing labels and ends up causing $1,000+ in repairs.",336,0,1
The internet is shrinking,"To start, I am not in tech support officially, but my mom calls all the time for tech support since she got her own computer. I figured everyone would get a kick out my mom's computer illiteracy. 

One day, she called.

""Hey, honey. How are you?""

""Studying. Whats up?""

""Can you help me? My internet is shrinking.""

""...Shrinking? Shrinking how? Do you mean being slow?""

""No, the speed is fine, but what I can see is shrinking.""

""Oh, you need to maximize it, then. It's the button next to the x on the internet window.""

""No, its full screen. I just have an inch of internet. Its been shrinking for a while.""

""Ok, what do you see?""

""Nothing. Just an inch of internet.""

""Is it black?"" (she cracked her screen a while back, so i was thinking lines going down)

""No, the 'bleeding' has not moved, but the internet is shrinking""

I try to talk her through a screen shot and she can not do it so

""Ok, mom. I am studying. Use the house computer. I will be home after work on Friday. I can look at it Friday or Saturday.""

So, come Saturday, the moment I walk into the door from work, she shoves the computer in my arms, going, ""Look, see? It's shrinking.""

can anyone guess what was wrong? Probably not, because who does this? My mom had installed over 30 toolbars. They were stacked under each other, taking 90% of the screen. It took me 20 minutes to clear out every toolbar. I had put an adblocker on her computer (three in fact), and she still got that many toolbars and 90% of her time on it is on Facebook or Pinterest.

Last time I visited (three days ago), she had another problem with her default page and search engine. It was another freaking toolbar. It changed nearly all of her settings.

Edit: for those saying I should screen share or get remote access there is an issue with this. After talking with my husband, he suggested shortening the edit to ""It has confidential info on it,"" so as to not risk anything.",1528,0,1
Tales from the IT hobo PT. 1,"This happened today, I don’t have a huge catalogue of fantastic stories, but I’m assuming I’m going to start collecting some. For some background, I was working at this company doing Network Security and Datacenter architecture for the past three or four years. It’s a fancy title but basically I get paid to go into medium/large sized enterprise environments and consult on their network and security and offer implementation solutions.  I also get handed escalated support tickets after we have gone in and made changes, and I’m usually hands-on during migrations and implementations. It’s a mixed bag of white hat, consolidations, and integrations.

All that out of the way, I recently resigned. I put in a long notice early July and have been working on training replacements to fit my duties ever since, with mixed success. Why did I resign? It’s not super important, management isn’t bad, but they are more difficult than they really should be and every conversation with them felt like a Sisyphean task, combined with strenuous call hours and missing my former life as a wanderer, I figured I have enough savings to take a break for a bit.

The initial plan was to take three weeks to train three employees to take over my duties. One for consulting, one for implementation, and one for support. It seemed like a straight forward plan. Dear reader, it was not. The consulting gig was filled pretty quickly internally, no big hassles there, we know the tech and we know where it belongs. The big hangups are with implementation and support. No one internally wanted the transfer (wonder why, they are _not_ fun jobs), the first imp guy lasted two weeks before cracking and leaving, the second guy sexually harassed someone at a clients office (we don’t put up with that shit) and the third guy seems to be trucking along like my old International Scout. As for support, we had two no-shows and this last guy seems solid in fundamentals but is taking a really long time to learn our internal tools. At this point both me and HR where getting fed up with the turnover and decided to invest our time and energy into these candidates. I thought we had hit a good point, and my last day was Friday. I did leave with the agreement that I could take tasks hourly and an exorbitant rate in order to fill in the gaps while people grow.

That brings us to this morning. I’m not going to lie, I went a little overboard over Labor Day weekend. Drove to the top of the mountain with a buddy, drank an entire case of banquets, and passed out directly on top of a sharp rock in my 1970s style USGI bivy sack. About 6:00am I receive a call from the support guy I trained, henceforth to be known as $sup.

*BRIING BRIING* from the Bluetooth speaker I had mounted haphazardly on the roof rack of my Toyota FJ. I groan as I attempt to unseal my clammy, damp legs from the freezing cesspool that is this Vietnam war era sleeping bag, somehow simultaneously hung over and still inebriated from the night before, the stench of cheap beer dripping from every pore in my body.

$me (angrily and probably slurred): WHAT?!

$sup (over the crackle of Verizon on EDGE with two bars): uuuuhhh, dude, so you know Cisco?

$me: I honestly don’t even know man, who are you?

$sup: it’s $sup, from work, you know client X with all the Cisco switches? Well I may have pushed out the wrong config over the TFTP server last night and I need your help.

$me: What? Why, how, when?

$sup: Well, I wanted to add a new VLAN for the SAN bridge, but I think I may have overwritten all the other VLANs.

$me: *expletives* well just pull the old config from backup and upload it over the management network

$sup: well, here is the thing, I may have accidentally overwritten the config for the management network, I can’t get into it.

$me: ....

$sup: ....

$me: ....

$sup: do you have your serial cable with you?

And that, lady’s and gentlemen, is how I started the first day of my “retirement” manually re-flashing Cisco configs on 27 switches, hung over, in a noisy sweaty server room. Mood.",215,0,1
Contracts manager loses all his contracts,"I was the local IT operations manager for a multinational food company. On site we had desktop support people from a large US based IT provider. They deployed PCs to users in our country.

One evening, desktop support guy, let’s call him Dave, is downstairs in the tech room preparing PCs for redeployment by reinstalling the OS and reformatting the drive etc. He uses a tool to do this that requires him to enter the PCs asset number to erase and rebuild it. He enters the wrong number.

Upstairs is the Contracts Manager, let’s call him Rahul. Rahul is at his desk and sees a message flash up saying that his PC is about to be erased Y/N? Rahul clicks Y. 

The next morning Rahul comes and sees me. I know nothing of what has happened. Rahul is very angry as his PC no longer contains any of his information and all his contracts are lost. He has only stored them on his C drive, despite all the comms to users recommending that they do not do this.

I talk to Dave and find out that he stuffed up but there’s nothing he can do and anyway Rahul clicked Y and should have saved his files elsewhere so it’s all Rahul’s fault.

Many weeks and several thousand dollars later we recover some of the files using forensic data recovery.

"Grandpa opens 1k+ tabs of Bing across 20 windows, deletes Task Manager","First post here, not in IT, blah blah blah.

This happened several years ago when I was still quite young, about 12y/o. My grandpa would consistently have ""problems"" with his laptop and I, since I was the only one who would do it, had to walk all the way from the flat me and my parents were living in all the way to my grandparents house.

I could go on and on about the absolutely crazy things I had to fix for him, but one of the most crazy ones was this. For several weeks my grandfather would complain about the computer being very slow and dialog boxes saying ""Page Not Responsive"". When he originally told me the problem I didn't exactly understand what he meant, but when I *did* go over and have a look at his computer, what I saw was absolutely ridiculous.

If there's one thing you should no about my grandfather, it's that he prides himself as being a ""primitive man"", which here means ""I don't have a fucking clue how to use a computer"". I have had to lecture him how to do simple things like change the brightness and volume and even how to properly shut down his PC for literal *years* and he still has not learnt. When I opened the computer, the thing popped up to a empty screen, but when I hovered over the icon for Microsoft Edge, there were, I kid you not, *20-30 windows* opened to the Bing homepage.

**Me:** $grandpa what the heck happened here?!

**Grandpa:** I don't know! That's why I'm asking you!

**Me:** You opened 50 windows or something, and all of them have 9 or 10 tabs each ^(oh my god actually why)

I then tried to pull up Task Manager from Program Search, the keyboard shortcut, anything. No matter what I did, Task Manager would not show up. After some searching, I found out that my grandfather had somehow used the Control Panel or something to *delete Task Manager*.

I had to spend the next 20 minutes individually closing all the windows. To be perfectly honest, I'm not 100% sure what he did to get that any windows open. One theory I had was that since he never turns off his computer he may have opened a new window every time he used the computer, but that doesn't explain how all of them were at the Bing homepage.

**TL;DR,** grandfather opens a crapton of windows and tabs without knowing, somehow deletes Task Manager.",1687,0,1
"A decade worth of e-mails all gone, by the simple non checking of a box. Life is fun, innit?","Hello all you glorious redditors here, I did post here a few years ago, but long since deleted my account and the tales with it - but alas I thought I would start posting stories of times gone by - now on to the story time!

**Background:**

At the age of 36 I live in my home town in Scotland where I was born and grew up, went to school and have my current job in retail for nearly four years now. This tale, amongst others that follow in this subreddit are from my job before this, where I worked in a callcentre for a national broadband, phone &amp; tv provider. I was in the business faults for broadband/phone line dealing with customers either on the phone or live chat over the 10 and a half years I was there before I was let go (that is a story for another time) - this story is from at some point whilst working there. It's worth keeping in mind that any names of customers, me and the company I did work for have been changed obviously to protect identities.

**Cast for this story:**

**Scotch:** Take a wild guess, hot stuff ;)

**EC:** E-Mail Customer

**CM:** Cool Manager (went through a couple whilst there, but at this point in time, CM was awesome)

**The Story:**

This story took place when Windows 7 was out for a few years and the customer decided to upgrade from their old XP machine to that, e-mails being one of the last thing he was looking to check - so this ir around 2011 ish.

*\*beep\**

**Scotch:** Welcome to &lt;telco's business support line&gt; my name is Scotch, who am I speaking to today and how can I help?

**EC:** Hi, my name is EC and all my e-mails have gone, I need your help! They are critical to my business you see.

**Scotch:** Sure, let me get some account details from you and lets see if we can get the problem fixed for you today EC.

*\*does account verification\**

**Scotch:** Thanks, ok, so the e-mails you lost, can you give me a bit more information about that? How do you normally check them? What setup do you have?

**EC:** I had a Windows XP machine, I used a program that came with it, I think it was Lookout Express? (Yes, he said it that way) and I used it in conjunction with \*your generic business e-mail address you guy's provide\* which I get my client orders from. I was using it for 10 years, it had all my e-mails in folders etc..

**Scotch:** Ahh, Outlook Express you mean, I know the program you are talking about, I can certainly help you with that, to see if we can recover or restore those e-mails for you! (Thinking it would be importing from a PST/EST file or looking for a backup if he had one).

**EC:** Well, I have actually invested in a new computer, upgraded from XP to Windows 7 and my IT guy got it all setup for me, getting Office installed with the paid for Lookout Express on it (read: Outlook 2007) and when he put in my e-mail info, none of my e-mails downloaded, though this is the first chance over the weekend I have had to call you about it and when I go on-the-line (he said that too) I can't see them through your portal (read: Outlook Web Access).

*Thinking this was a bit strange, I talked him through out remote access software (go to assist) and got to his screen which he was happy to do.*

**Scotch:** That's me now on your screen, I am going to look at the settings on Outlook Express to see what I can find out for you.

*I checked the settings and all appear fine, but I did notice that the option for ""Leave a copy on the server"" was not checked.*

**Scotch:** Do you see this option here?

**EC:** Yes I do, why are you showing me this?

**Scotch:** Just want to let you see something, if close this program and send you an e-mail from our test account, will you logon to the portal, with me still connected and we both can see this e-mail?

**EC:** *\*a bit hesitant but not grasping what was to lie ahead\** Ok...

*He opens it, I send him a test e-mail and it appears in the inbox*

**Scotch:** As you can see the e-mail is there, can I get you to close the portal for me and open the e-mail program to get the e-mail for me?

**EC:** Sure \*does so\* - right I can see your e-mail there, but I already know the mail account is working.

**Scotch:** Now if we logon to the portal again, you will see that the e-mail is gone...

*The customer logs on and see's the e-mail is gone.*

**Scotch:** If you remember EC that option I showed you earlier? If that was selected in Outlook Express, to leave a copy on line and you have ben downloading your e-mails like this for over 10 years, we at \*shitty ISP\* won't have a copy for you.

**EC:** WHAT?!?!?!? What are you trying to tell me? That all my previous e-mails are gone, I NO LONGER HAVE THEM?

**Scotch:** Well, EC, think of it this way...when someone sends you an item via the post, it gets sent to the central hub, then to the dispatch hub then gets delivered to you, e-mails work in the same idea, that when a person sends you an e-mail, it gets sent from their services, like the central hub, which then forwards to our services, the dispatch hub, then to your mail client. Unlike the post, that little box I showed you requests us to keep a copy of the e-mail on our services for you, without it checked then we won't.

**EC:** SO.I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING??? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

**Scotch:** Well EC, I am sorry to say but there is nothing that we at \*shitty ISP\* can do for you, as that option was setup like that, the majority of configurations like that are the way they are. You mentioned that you had an IT guy, correct? Did he configure any backups for you or do you still have the old hard disk drive that you used? Your IT maybe able to pull it off that?

**EC:** I no longer have the hard drive as he took it out and destroyed it so no one could gain access to it!!!!

**Scotch:** Well, EC - I have checked that box for you, so we will, moving forward, keep a copy of your e-mails, but for the previous 10 years worth of stuff, we can't do anything about that.

**EC:** GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOW!!!!!! I AM NOT HAVING THIS - I AM ONE OF YOUR CALUED CUSTOMERS AND YOU CANT TREAT ME LIKE THIS! I WILL LOOSE MY BUSINESS BECAUSE OF YOU!!!

**Scotch:** Please calm down EC, I understand your frustration there, I really do, however my manager will advise of the same, nothing we can do and to speak to your IT incase there is a backup of it.

**EC:** DID YOU NOT HEAR ME? MANAGER!

**Scotch:** Please hold whilst I get my manager for you.

*I disconnected from my remote access, went over to CM who was in the next bay from me, advised him quickly of the situation and he asked me to transfer the call to him and update the case notes.*

**Scotch:** Ok, EC, I have spoke to my CM, his name is &lt;Cool Manager&gt; and I am now transferring you over to him.

*I updated the notes, saved them, then went on to take a few more calls, around 45 minutes later I took my break and found CM.*

**Scotch:** So, CM, what was the outcome of that call?

**CM:** \*Laughs a little\* He is going to speak to his IT guy for failing to backup anything - but he really was clueless on the whole e-mail thing. Not that I can blame him, as IT is not for everyone, but he should have had least a backup of the stuff or his IT guy made him aware of it!

**Scotch:** I hope that he and the IT guy does find a resolution...

**TLDR: Where's my flask of Whisky and serving of haggis? I need to go on an epic journey with my moose to track down some e-mails a customer lost, as he did not back them up before he upgraded.

C: staff are using office ipad &amp; office online, but they need to use desktop to do some things. Office needs to be updated. It says it is from 2008, even in the o365 folder. This needs to be done asap 

T:Hello C, Microsoft's version numbers use year and month. This version of o365 is from last month, August (8th month) of year' 20.

C: ...",294,0,1
I can fix your problem or I can talk to you,"This happened about 5 years back so the details are a bit fuzzy but another post brought it to light. 

Players: Me- T1 firewall monkey that usually deals with Vendors as well

Client Advocate (CA) - A member of our team who works directly with management of the client (usually to bypass our protocols to get a 'faster' resolution) 

Karen - Primary contact at the company, a Karen in all other respects.

Karen's company had recently merged with another company in the same industry (ah the crash of '08), both Companies were clients of ours. As such both companies were monitored in our system. At this time 100% of Karen's resources were hosted on-prem. I forget date but that day a ""router"" went down at one of the big ISPs that took out a good chunk of the country. We had dozens of our clients in the same area having issues connecting to the internet (down detector was showing red for most of the map). I got one of the P1 tickets generated and stated looking through the issue. I found quickly that it was due to the ISP. I bundled all tickets for this issue (including those for the second company) and started calling the ISP. I was placed in queue and was there for \~20 min before I get a Jabber message:

  
Co-worker1:I have Karen on the line, its about the outage  
Me: Let her know that I'm on the phone with ISP and I'll get her an update as soon as I have one from the ISP

\[repeat every 10 minutes, each time i tell them I'm still on hold with the ISP\]

Finally after about 90 minutes on hold a CA member comes in to physically talk to me (this is a big deal as most of the non-technical staff do not come near us on the Service Desk)

CA: Why are you not taking any of Karen's calls about this issue?   
Me: Because I've been on hold with the ISP for the past hour and a half. I can either hold my place and talk to the iSP and get her issue resolved or  I can take her call, hang up on the ISP, and then restart the clock as I get back in to queue.   
CA:Ok, I'll relay that to her.

After another hour I was able to lodge ticket 1234 with the ISP that is related to GIANT OUTAGE. It took the ISP another 12 hours to figure out what happened. Once it was completed I followed up with Karen who was pretty gruff that i wouldn't talk to her while I was on hold with the ISP.",1129,0,1

Blame and Redemption,"It's a cloudy Saturday morning. My toddler is eagerly cramming Cheerios in her mouth as I sip my morning coffee and browse Reddit. Suddenly, I hear the familiar ding of a work email on my phone and I make the mistake of opening it.

A senior technician at my company is working on a Server migration for a client and the old Host Server isn't showing up in our remote software and he needs it to fire up an old VM to look at some settings.

You see, this senior tech is very good at what he does, but is averse to learning anything new and requests assistance for anything that's outside of the scope of what he knows.

One of those things is the ins and outs of using one machine to control another without remoting directly to the other machine. Since 99% of the technical work I do is via remote connections, I've gotten pretty good at finding shortcuts to do what I need to get done.

As I'm contemplating whether I want to get involved or not, another ding chimes in. It's the boss. He correctly states that I had worked on updating our remote access software the previous night. However, he also incorrectly guesses that the Server is one of the victims of my upgrade and that's why it's offline.

Since I was getting the blame, I figured I may as well get involved. Especially because I distinctly recall that server being offline when I went to update that customer's machines the previous night. I double-check the connection history and confirm that it was offline before I started my work and I never sent the update command to that machine.

I jump on a VM on the new host and unsuccessfully attempt to connect to the old Host via RDP. Next, I pull up the services on the old Host and try restarting the remote access service - that didn't help. 

Finally, I find that I can control the VMs on the old host from the new. From there, I started the VM that the senior tech looking for and it comes to life in our remote access software.

Then, about a minute later, the old Host comes back online as well!

The issue - if you haven't already figured it out - the senior tech forgot to change DNS servers on the old Host's network adapter before shutting down both VMs that were providing DNS to it.

It really is always DNS. Oh, and yes, I did update the remote access client on both the VM and the old Host - no issues.

So, that's the story of how I fixed an issue that I was blamed for, even though I had nothing to do with it.",660,0,1
Just keep calling her every five minutes until she fixes it,"I work for a small theater and do many things for them, but mostly tech support.  Ever since I had kids, they let me work from home and the staff calls when they have trouble.

About 10 years ago we had this issue where most evenings just before the show started, the computers in the box office would get slower... and slower... until they froze and had to be rebooted.  It didn’t happen every night, but it always happened on the busiest ones.  I spent months scouring event logs, installing different AV software, stripping them down to nothing but the ticketing software, but nothing fixed it.  I knew it had to be that software itself, but that company’s support swore it wasn’t them, and had to be our machines.  

At the time, I also had an infant at home, and it never failed that as soon as I’d get him to sleep, the box office staff would call and the phone (a landline) would ring and wake him up.  One night, I had an extra difficult time getting him to sleep, and of course the phone rang.  I told them for the umpteenth time there was nothing I could do, just reboot.  Then I heard a worker in the background say, “just keep calling her every 5 minutes tonight until she fixes it.”  I was livid.  I hung up and figured out how to block their number.  After that, I started blocking it every evening at 5pm until the next morning.  Eventually we started using another company’s software and never had that issue again.",1520,0,1
Disaster Averted...,"This happened this week.

In the school district I work for we bring in all staff laptops during the summer break to maintain and update them so the staff have basically a clean install to start the new year with. Its a pain but it prevents a lot of problems.

So this week I get an email from the school nurse. She wants to know where her laptop is. I look around and its nowhere to be found. I provide laptops for all of my districts nurses as they are run from a central location that I also am in charge of. And there are a lot of them. Its a big district. 

Most of the nurses got new laptops last year so losing one is a big deal. I know they are encrypted so I'm not concerned with losing data, but because of distance learning I have absolutely no spare laptops younger than the first graders at this particular school.

So searched all of my sites trying to find this machine to no avail. I had come to the conclusion that I had mixed her machine up with one that was to go to a new hire. I asked for the asset tag number so I could figure out who was going to have to give up their laptop for an older version.

Amazingly she had recorded the asset number and gave it to me. 

Now at this point I'm confused. The number is so low it could not possibly be correct. If this were a valid number it would mean that her laptop would be so old if it were a child it would have aged out of this elementary school and would be half way through middle school.

So I said ""What the f\*\*\*"" and went through every machine on campus. And there I found it. Like the Holy Grail. A 13 year old laptop on the top of my e-waste pile. HER laptop. 

It was originally licensed for XP but was running Windows 7. She just didn't want to give it up because she had gotten used to it.

I recovered her files and gave her a ""new"" machine that was at least age appropriate for an elementary school.",722,0,1
It's all in the monitors,"Little bit of a short one, but I feel this took some time off my life.

I had a support ticket for moving some computers across a campus from one building into another, which is no big deal. I just needed to unplug everything, round them up in a box, and carry them to their new home and get everything hooked back up. Sweet and simple and easy. For one of the people moving, where they were moving to had better monitors that were compatible with what she already had and didn’t need any new cables. Upon this, I decided to explain it to her and see if she would like having the new and better monitors.

“But my old screens have my desktop and everything saved on them.”

What?

“You know, like all my icons, my wallpaper, my files, everything. They are all saved on those screens.”

Now, her computer was not an all-in-one. It was a mini-PC. So I explained to her that the small black box sitting behind her monitors was her computer and all of her files and settings were saved there, so if she wanted new monitors, everything would still be there.

“No the icons were on my screens, so they are saved to my screens.”

Needless to say, I was dumbfounded and at a loss for what to say to this lady. I explained to her once again that ultimately, her monitors didn't matter since everything she needed was inside of this magical box. She still refused to accept this, stating that it didn't make sense because everyone has their own monitors and their own set up, so everything must have been on the monitors.

Her stubbornness won, however, so I ended up taking the good monitors off the stand, and installed her old ones. While she may have won the battle, someone else won the war and got some nice monitors to replace their set up.",952,0,1
Never let managers near the keyboard,"Ok, going back into ancient history, somewhere around 1989...   

(Sorry, the background takes a little while)

I used to administer several OS/2 servers for departments at a university.   
One day, we had a call that printing had stopped working for one department.   
The server was an IBM PS/2 desktop with an HP clone laser printer hooked up to the parallel port (LPT1:).  

For whatever reason, the department decided that C:\ on the server should be shared with read/write access to all users. Yes, there was a directory structure they stored their files in, but generally, things were ok.   

Until the day a user brought in some shareware software they “needed” to use.
After creating whatever report they were working on, they went to print.
Being a DOS pc, they had to configure their printer. Knowing the printer was on LPT1: on the server, they figured that’s what they needed to set but managed to do that as a “print to file” thing.

DOS being DOS and brain-dead (and this being v1.2 of OS/2), the server dutifully created the file.   
Printing ceased.   

I spent an hour trying to remove the d*mn file without luck.   

(Enter the rogue manager).  

It was at that point (as I was talking to the department boss) my manager took the keyboard and said “I know!” and proceeded to issue the command “DEL *.*” on the root of the C: drive, then reboot!   

The word “oops” was said, followed by “can you fix that?”   

For the uninitiated, an OS/2 install was done from floppy disk. All 20 of them. Then the 10 “Corrective Service” disks",1561,0,1
Video cards can have those?,"Hello, enemies. Short time poster, first time lurker.

I was asked to test a video card that had fried a machine $dayjob tried to use at a convention to show off their work. So I plugged it in, turned on the machine... Almost nothing. The power came on, the screen lit up, but nothing else happened. Did some fiddling, nothing changed. Unplugged, switched back to the old card... No change. Swap to integrated graphics, no change. fsck.ext4 /home/niveusluna

Told the CTO, he was understanding. Told our hardware guy, he said, ""And you plugged in the extra power cables?""

I paused. ""Video cards can have power cables?""

We both went to check the video card in question. Sure enough, it had a couple cables coming off the end that I hadn't seen. Because they weren't plugged in, the necessary power had been routed through the motherboard. The motherboard and its components weren't rated for that kind of current, which was why the video card had those cables to start with.

Updated the CTO on what happened and asked whether he was willing to potentially sacrifice a third machine to find out whether the initial frying (at the convention) was due to a bad card or user error.

I remained employed with that company. Yes, it was an expensive lesson, but I will not make that mistake again.

For those wondering, he said no.",190,0,1
Users and their network drives,"A laptop died this morning: press F to pay respects etc...

I give the user a pool laptop, they log in...

User: my desktop icons are missing

Me: no, it’s all there

User: no, I’m missing my files, spreadsheets etc...

Me: are they saved to your Home drive?

User: I don’t think so

Me: takes a look, nope not there. They’re lost I’m afraid. Your old laptops drive has died.  You need to save things to your home drive to keep them safe

User: well I didn’t expect my laptop to die today

Me: sorry about that, I’ll arrange a more convenient day next time

User looks at me, I could tell he was sure if I was joking or not. Walked off.",255,0,1
how hard can remote support be? the answer: very hard,"so we're moving users over to office365 from office2010. this involves moving users over to a new remote desktop farm. users remote on using an I.E link on their desktop. they sign in, then click on an icon. with the new farm, they have a second icon. relatively simple.

most users are now migrated, but some are still logging onto the old farm. i contact these users and ask them to start using the new farm by clicking on the second icon. one user says she doesn't have the icon (which i know is untrue as i've tested all of the users) but i give her the benefit of the doubt. and so starts the email exchange. 

I am \[me\]. she is \[user\]

\[user\] -   Hi I was speaking to \[user2\] and she said she has a new icon on her computer however I haven’t.  If you remember I had to take \[user3s\] computer home with me not my own as somebody took this during lockdown.  Can you please sort out as I am working from home and it is very difficult to try to sort out.

thanks  

\[me\] - Morning \[user\]. Can you go to sos.splashtop.com and I’ll jump on and have a look

\[user\] -   I will do it now is this on the internet 

\[user\] - I have gone on internet and typed what you said I don’t know if you can see this 

\[user\] - Hi \[me\] I have done onto internet and put in what you said but it is coming up with options do I just leave it for you to get into.  Can you let me know when you are going to access this and I will finish what I am doing  

\[me\] -   Hi \[user\]– you’ll need to follow the instructions on the site for me to be able to log on

\[user\] - Sorry \[me\] its coming up with options and questions I got through to a live chat person that cannot be right?  Can you talk me through this as I have never done this

\[user\] - Do I press splashtop remoter access 

\[me\] - please follow the instructions on the site 

(note:at this point i'd not realised she'd gone to the homepage)

\[user\] - When I go on its got 5 options, Remote Access, Splashtop Remote Desktop, SOS, Remote Access to PC and Remoter Computer support which one !!!

\[me\] - Go to sos.splashtop.com. open the program that downloads. Give me the number that comes up

\[user\] -   \[splashtop number\]

(i try the number. it connects me to the old remote session rather than her actual PC. my fault, should have specified)

\[me\] -   Thanks, though this is connecting me to the remote session and not your pc where the icons would appear. Can you go to the site on your pc

\[user\] -   What site sorry \[me\] I am having a mare of a morning 

(narrator - sigh)

\[me\] -   Sos.splashtop.com

\[user\] -   Its on screen now

\[me\] -   That’s lovely but you still need to follow the instructions. If you want me to help you, you need to participate in the process

\[user\] -   \[splashtop number\] it is in my downloads folder – I don’t know what else its asking me  

\[me\] -   That code isn’t working – did you close the window with the code? What is in your downloads folder?

\[user\] -   \[splashtop number\]

\[user\]  - Right the code is open on my computer which has been downloaded from my file it is \[splashtop number\]

\[user\] -   Right I have started again \[splashtop number\] I have not closed this down x  

\[me\] -   That works, though you’ve done it on the remote session again

"We've reached an agreement that before I submit any more testing tickets with the title ""test ticket"" I will give them a heads up that the ticket I'm submitting is a test ticket.","**Flavor-Text-You-Can-Totally-Skip**

Our dept. has had its own project in our $TicketSystem for years. This project also connects to $AlertSystem so that on-call engineers get notified of after-hours tickets. Both of these things long predate the creation of a department we'll call $ProblemMonitoring.

Recently, in order to ~~increase bureaucracy,~~ *improve efficiency,* various company-wide automated tasks have been added between $TicketSystem projects and $ProblemMonitoring. This was to ensure that they knew about and could monitor *all* issues so that ~~if we failed to follow procedure~~ *needed any assistance*, they could jump in. Notably, this was done without our input or feedback.

Today, I needed to test the $TicketSystem-$AlertSystem integration in our project as we were having a few cases of missed notifications. This requires submitting a test ticket--something that's moderately routine.

----

&gt; **$ProblemMonitoring**: That alert that you sent off fired off an incident for us as well.

&gt; **$Me**: Ok *[This feels like a* ***you*** *problem]*

&gt; **$ProblemMonitoring**: What was that for?

&gt; **$Me**: The ""testing network alerts"" ticket?

&gt; **$ProblemMonitoring**: What were you testing... Are they always going to come in as critical? the projects directly tie together

&gt; **$Me**: Testing the alert system for critical issues

&gt; **$ProblemMonitoring**: Ok. Specifically $AlertSystem? What alert system, we can't have incidents firing off left and right.

&gt; **$Me**: The $TicketSystem-$AlertSystem integration, yes. It's one issue, not ""left and right""

&gt; **$ProblemMonitoring**: That's what I'm making sure isn't going to happen. In the future, if you can give us a heads up when testing any critical/major alerts.

&gt; **$Me**: Sure, I'll let you know beforehand *[that the title ""test issue"" means that the issue is a test]*.

Reboot your computers!," I had this comment on r/iiiiiiitttttttttttt and it was suggested I post it here.

I work as Tier 2 Desktop Support and I had two users that kept getting locked out Monday. The service desk called me as well as our AD guy for help. I'd unlock their AD account but within 5 minutes they'd be locked out again.

For one of the user's who was on a laptop, I went so far as to clear everything from Credential Manager and all of his browsers, but within a few minutes of me unlocking his account he'd be locked out again. The second user was on Citrix, so this shouldn't have been an issue since we don't allow the storing of passwords, but it was the same for them.

So after being thorouly confused on why he keeps getting locked out we turned to our AD guy for some help. He was able to determine they were getting locked out from the same machine which was locked in a secure room. The odd thing was the Citrix user hasn't been on that team for a year so shouldn't even have access to the machine.

I located the machine easily enough and turned it off. Issue immediately resolved. Okay, so now it's time to see why this was going on.

I take it down to staging and boot it back up which takes forever. It's one of our older HP EliteDesks with a spiny drive which we've been phasing out. I log in and open Start to check some things out.

Wait, something's wrong. Why does the start menu look like this? Oh my gosh, it's still running 1511! We've been on 1803 for over a year and have even since moved on to 1903. Well, it's old and a few updates behind so my solution is just going to be to kill it and replace it with one of the hundreds of Optiplex 3070s we have sitting in a room that the board decided to purchase (without consulting IT) due to COVID-19 (don't ask).

Just for fun I check the logs. Last time powered on was August 19th, not too bad. Wait, does that say 2019? How does a Windows PC not crash in over a year? Why has no one at least restarted this thing when SCCM tells the user to? Well, that explained just about... everything.

Updates were behind because it hasn't been rebooted in so long and users were being locked out because it was wakened from sleep and they were still logged in with AD passwords that were way expired.

I proceed to get the phone and usually, I start by downloading Google Photos, but storage is full. I see that she deleted literally 50% of her apps. Then I do my due diligence and check the storage menu. What do I find? **Spotify, taking up 61gb in downloads.**

Me: Mom, I think I found your problem.

Mom: What?

Me: Spotify is taking up **half of your storage.**

Mom: \*embarrassed laugh\* 

I decide to check Spotify just for kicks. I see a prompt at the top saying ""**2739 out of 3079 songs downloaded**""

Me: Mom, you have 3079 songs downloaded.

Mom: \*more embarrassed laughing\* I was deleting family pictures and tearing up! How are you going to fix it?

Me: Mom, I have to delete Spotify and reinstall it.

Mom: So my songs won't be downloaded anymore?

Me:  Yes. This time, **pick songs that you will actually listen to.**

Customer asks us to bypass password for device they cant prove is theirs,"Customer: comes in saying their password isnt working anymore after a restore and they need help getting in  
Me: tells customer we can bypass password but we need proof of ownership

Customer: but you just saw me type in my password, its my computer!

Me: yes ma'am I did but that's not proof of ownership, i need an invoice that the computer was sold to you.

Customer: well i got it from a pawn shop two years ago.

Me: then I need an invoice that they sold this computer to you

Customer: isn't there something you can do?

Me: i can reset the device but that wipes everything on it.

Customer: but you just said you can bypass the password! I need this for my business! I do graphic design  


Me: yes, I can, with proof of ownership.

Me: (internally, not vocaly) you aint doing no graphic design on that 15 year old vista built computer  


Customer: Alright, fine ill go get proof of ownership, this is bad customer service but ill go get it.

Customer: \*brings in laptop again\*

Customer: okay so im here to get my computer reset

Me: okay, so that runs 50$ and...

Customer: but I just want to try my password a few more times

Me: okay, let me know when you're ready

Customer: and you cant bypass the password.

Me: not without proof of ownership

Customer: but i have my proof of ownership

Me: okay may I see it?

Customer: yeah but why wereyou going to reset it instead of bypass it?

Me: because i didnt have proof of ownership.

Customer: but i have it!

Cleaning up the system folder,"This was back in the mid 2000s when I was working as a tech/sales engineer for mainly ad agencies, printers and so on. Creative and nice people and generally great coffee but usually not especially tech-savvy.

One day I got a call from a panicked young lady working for one of our customers.

She: My Mac does not start up anymore!

Me: Me: OK. did you do anything out of the ordinary while working?

She: Nothing!  (Oh, if I got a euro for each time I hear that one....) 

Me: Is there any error message shown?  

She: Nothing! 

At that point, I just reached for my bootable firewire disk and started driving to that place. 

One hour later I got there, we went right to the computer and I started it up. Sure enough: It showed the Mac equivalent of a ""no system or disk error"". I opened the case, checked the cables (they might have come loose after all) and switched it back on again. Same error.

Well, that could mean, that the hard drive was likely shot, but as it didn't sound weird, I thought there might be a good chance for recovering at least some of the data.

Enter the firewire disk for booting up the mess and: The disk was detected flawlessly. All data reachable, no err ----wait. what's that?

Me: that's strange. somehow the systems folder (like the Windows folder on PCs) is gone. Are you sure you did nothing to the system?

She: nothing! well.. except.. I cleaned up the files a bit and there was this folder with a lot of files I didn't know, so I deleted them.

Me: like..20.000 files?

She: Maaaaybeee.

So: She deleted the Operating system from her computer and I had to install everything again, look for the CDs (that was way before the days of cloud downloads), register them, etc. 

A day and a half later she had a newly installed and updated OSX plus all the applications installed, configured and an invoice for about 1800€. The company paid it in full and appearently considered it a learning experience for her, as she kept worked for that company for a few years after that.

The time we crashed a VAX by Osmosis,"I’ll start by saying anyone has been around as long as I have will recognize this is an old story because the VAX was one of the big mainframe computers, not one that took an entire room, but a good portion of one. Relevant to the story is the fact that the software for these computers was put on reel to reel tapes that were shipped to the customers.

I worked for a company that manufactured software for these computers and it was quite easy for a bug in the software to cause the computers to crash, Which leads to the phone call.  

“Your software crashed our system!”  Is how the caller announced himself, so immediately I do the apologetic that’s so awful and I’m so sorry etc. etc. etc.
Then “Could you tell me where you loaded the software?”

These computers, they were fussy critters, and you had to put the software in the right location internally or that alone could cause the system to crash and we all know how customers like to ignore instructions that they think are unimportant. Like the ones that say, “please follow the installation instructions exactly as written or else your system may crash.”

The customer answers, “I walked into the computer room and set it on top of the computer and the whole system went down.”

“ I beg your pardon?”

“I sent the tape reel on top of the computer and it crashed!  You crashed my VAX!”

“Could I have you hold just a moment please, sir?”

Then I muted my headset and started laughing. Guy next to me asked me what the heck, so I looked up and said, “apparently we crashed this guy’s computer by osmosis.”

“How????”

“We apparently are that powerful. Merely touching our software to the outside of the system caused the entire system to die.”

Once I had stopped laughing, I returned to the customer and gave him instructions on how to send us his crash dump (I don’t know if it’s still called that, it’s just a log of what was happening when the system went down). 

Spoiler alert: Our software was not the cause of the problem. It remains my favorite tech-support call ever though. 

DEATH Says no cats were harmed during this tech-support incident",1653,0,1
Never give up,"First time poster, on a mobile, etc. TLDR at the bottom.

So, I’m not a traditional tech support person, just the slightly tech savvy husband of a (tech savvy in her own way) primary school teacher at a small village school somewhere in the UK. The school has recently come out of special measures but is still a work in progress. As with all schools, funding is tight. Do they fix a leaky roof or upgrade IT? You guessed right, IT is a distant second.

When Lockdown can back in March, there were some intense brainstorming sessions by the school staff on how to engage with pupils, particularly those from a socially disadvantaged demographic who were at most risk of being left behind if left to their own devices. One of the staff had found an online platform (ClassDojo) which was really well received by pupils and parents alike. Unfortunately you need to be able to get online to use it. 

My wife mentioned that it was annoying they couldn’t lend out some school iPads as one of the SEN kids has managed to activation lock them and nobody knew the login details due to changes in IT suppliers when converting from a local authority run school to an Academy school.  The head teacher was resigned to the fact that these were bricked and beyond saving, as their current IT support had already tried to unlock them. Seeing as I was furloughed at the time I took it as a challenge to get them back online.

First port of call was the former IT support company where luck would have it, the guy who set them up in the first place (we’re talking original iPad mini, so 5-6 years ago) answered the phone. He tried to setup the recovery email address again, but unfortunately nothing came through.

We spoke to Apple Education (in the US) who were really helpful saying that if we could get an invoice then they could be reset. It was such a long time ago though, who would have the record? Luck would have it, the Local Authority has a digitised invoicing system, so were able to pull up the scans and email them over. Result! The stars are aligning...

Except there were no serial numbers on the invoices. I mean seriously, why would a supplier write X iPads and not list the serial numbers too?! A call to the supplier resulted in a cry of anguish and frustration as they’d migrated systems a few years back and lost some data including the invoices in question...!

Another call to Apple - explained where we were, was there anything that could be done? It turns out that as long as the invoice has the serial numbers written on - even by hand (!!!!!) then they could reset the iPads. Great! I wrote on the serials and submitted to Apple to then be rejected as they don’t “match”. I then do some more research and find that you can ID the date of manufacture from the serial, so needed to make sure the dates matched (there were two invoices a year or so apart). Did this, resubmitted and got them unlocked! 15 iPads back from the dead!

First thing I did after fist pumping in satisfaction was to ring the current IT supplier to get the MDM profile sent over so the iPads could be locked down to prevent this happening in the future. After setting up, they were able to be issued out to the children in need, to then not be used for the entire summer judging by their reported lack of interaction with ClassDoJo 🤦‍♂️

TL;DR: School has disabled iPads, I do some detective work and get them unlocked.",495,0,1
You're lucky I've worked here for 5 years,"I’m first line support for an application that doctors use to keep records on their patients as well as manage the practice. It’s called an EMR or Electronic Medical Record.

Background: We have these things called Observation Terms Kits. They're released every month. As new terms were added around COVID, they were released weekly. In simple terms, they're an industry standard list of codes for illnesses, injuries, etc. So, for instance, a pregnancy test has one obs term, another for patients that are smokers, etc. The new kits have new codes along with the old. So, it's like getting a new dictionary every month with new words along with the old.

Normally, these codes don't ever change. Three years ago, one changed. Specifically the code for a mammogram. 

In a patient's chart is something called a flowsheet. It's basically a spreadsheet with these terms on the left side and the date in columns along the top. Instead of looking through a bunch of documents, a doctor can see on the flowsheet that the patient's temperature was 98.1° on 7/24 and then 98.4° on 8/16 and so on.

The case:

The customer enters a case through the customer portal and explains their issue so poorly that I think they’re talking about billing codes that aren’t importing into the EMR correctly from a third party. They make it sound like all codes are having a problem. Since this sounds more like an issue in the billing section of our software, I ask one of our billing techs to join a call with me and the customer. The customer invites someone from the third party. 

The meeting starts and there’s a bunch of trouble getting everyone on their side into the conference call. Then they spend a bunch of time explaining the issue, again confusedly. We finally get to the actual issue. Lab results for a mammogram aren’t importing into the flowsheet as expected. So, I ask to see an example and they show me one of the patients. Naturally, the customer insists that nothing has changed and this issue started all of a sudden. The tech from the third party insists that nothing has changed on their end.

I can’t explain to them why this changed all of a sudden. Why this one code is having a problem if what they’re telling me is true, that nothing has changed. The fact that this is a mammogram starts nagging at me. 

In the interface, there’s a file that translates the third party’s code (lab companies will often use their own names/numbers for tests) to our codes. I ask that we change the code on our side to the new code from 3 years ago (though I don’t point out just how old this change is because “nothing has changed”) but they insist that I not change the code. Even just to test. They’d had some server issues the previous week and are extremely nervous about changing anything now that everything but this is now working.

If they were wrong and a new copy of the observation terms kit had been imported, the value in the database for a mammogram would have been updated. But we don’t have access to the database. Nobody on the call has it. So, my only option is to change the translation file, test, and revert back if it doesn’t fix the issue.

As I’m pleading to change the file and test, some of the people on the call have to leave and we end the call agreeing to meet again. The time will be worked out via email.

A week goes by and I get no response from the customer. I say that I’ll be closing the case due to no reply from the customer and explain what I intended to do. They finally update me and I explain what needs to be done again. The customer finally schedules a meeting for two weeks from the current date. There’s a vacation that the customer is going on and the issue, apparently, can wait.

We finally meet yesterday. I tell them exactly what I’m going to change and that we can change it back, with no harm done to anything, if it doesn’t work for a test patient. They finally relent. I change the translation file. Have the third party send a mammogram result for a test patient. It works as expected. The actual fix and test takes 5 minutes. And I both rejoice and scream at them in my head.",138,0,1
TFTS Finally something to post,"over the years ive commented a bit but never posted my own story. mostly because i'd rather not relive my horror stories and sometimes because I am not sure if i can or should share a story.

Today is different...because today i got to be someone's hero, and we all deserve to be told that our dedication saved the day once in a while. 

I spent my entire morning on a call with a customer half way around the world. But this was one of those issues that had already drug on too long and been touched by too many people for it to be a simple matter. And looking at the message thread that came before where i joined i see its got LOTS of visibility....people with Titles (with big letters and junk) on both sides active in the thread and none of them seem especially happy... Time to jump on a grenade!

Fast forward uh....6 HOURS? good lord....and the issue still wasn't really entirely fixed BUT we got most of it up and running and learned some odd stuff along the way. And as far as a software vendor support dude is concerned i went way beyond what i probably needed to - but this is MY CUSTOMER and he was desperate (Titles on both sides remember) i cannot just leave him twisting in the wind. By the end he was telling me steadily how much he appreciated my effort, and i appreciate the appreciation right back!

All that to say, yall in TFTS work hard and when you are working your hardest and pulling off honest digital miracles, nobody even knew you were doing anything.

Sometimes my hubby farms me out for tech support,"Being the tech go-to guy, I usually get called for tech support for my hubby (whom I have wrote about before) and my sister's family.

My hubby does have this annoying habit on occasion of volunteering my tech skills to our friends.  This happened over the weekend.  I had just got back home from the hospital, I thought I was having cardiac issues (I had a mild heart attack on July 1st) but it turned out to be acid reflux (which can manifest itself as a heart attack.) Note: it happened at my job on Saturday.

Well, after I got home from the hospital, the hubby told me that our friend (who we will call L) was having sound issues with with his desktop computer after he had moved it across the street to his new house.  The hubby told him that we would stop by after I got done with work.

So today rolled around, and after we went to the pharmacy to pick up my acid reflux meds and stopped at the supermarket for ingredients for dinner (pasta carbonara, which I love) we headed to L's house.

L is a sweet guy, and he uses his computer to compose music, so obviously he needs speakers for playback. So I pull up his desktop on the screen, and check the audio settings.  It said that it was using digital output for the speakers (a nice 2.1 setup,) and when I looked at them, I knew for a fact that the speakers use an analog output.  (My computer is the same way, since I also have 2.1 speakers.) So I get down to the tower and check the cabling, and sure enough, the speaker jack was plugged into the wrong output.  I corrected it, and then pulled up his music composition program and loaded one of his compositions.  Sure enough, music started pouring out of the speakers.

I told L what happened, and he said ""Well, my brother hooked my computer back up for me.""

I told him, ""He put the jack in the wrong damn hole.""

L: ""Oops. I knew you could figure it out."" (Note, I had provided tech support for him before when he was trying to transfer photos from his camera to his computer, and all he had to do was turn the camera on.)

So when I got back in the car (the hubby had to stay there because our Great Dane was in the back seat,) the hubby asked what was wrong.  I told him ""The jack was in the wrong hole.""  My hubby with his dirty mind started snickering when I said that.

Nothing earth shattering, just another instance of being unofficial tech support.

"Somehow I don't think a ""Caution: Exploding Hard Drives"" sign will really solve this one","Back when a disturbingly large amount of people liked IE and even used it by choice, I was working for a company that manufactured large metal things.

We had been hard at work at a major IT infrastructure upgrade.  It had all the usual trappings of such things: gripes from the users that dislike change and would just like DOS back thankyouverymuch, gripes about the color of the new icons, gripes about everything.  The IT team had been working hard at this thankless job for a long while but it was getting to us all.

Part of the project was replacing hundreds of PCs with newer models.  This was resulting in enough hard drives to destroy that our previous destruction method was overwhelmed.  So we had to find some other options.  We didn't have the time or space to do something like DBAN on hundreds of PCs, so we needed something better, and fast.

I had recently been promoted to my first managerial position, and I applied my ""employee empowerment"" lesson and let my tech team  brainstorm about how to destroy all the data on those hard drives.  I had expected ideas about e-waste recyclers, etc.  But no.  EVERY idea involved using large, dangerous machinery out in the manufacturing area.  Some of them carried a risk of death, and my team was most excited about those.

""Would an hour in {EXTREMELY HOT INDUSTRIAL OVEN} destroy the data?""

""What if we dropped them into {VAT OF DANGEROUS CHEMICAL}?""  ""Or better, what if we THREW them into {VAT} and watched {CHEMICAL} splash all over the place?""  Laughter from the team.  Grimace from me.

""Maybe we could use some spare wire and build ourselves an eeeeeenormous electromagnet and wipe them that way!"" 

""How about the acetylene torch?""

""Maybe throw them at {LARGE SPINNING EQUIPMENT} and watch them get chopped to bits?""  ""Nah, the bits would fly all over the place.""  ""EVEN BETTER!  We could SWEEP UP our hard drives when we're done!""

""How about bats like in Office Space?""  ""No, AXES would be better!""

""What about the welders?  Surely they could pulverise them somehow?""  ""No, the ROBOTIC welders!  We'll program them to destroy the drives!""  ""Or maybe the laser cutters?""

""Could we put them in a big pile, douse them with gas, and just light them all on fire?""

You can see this was going downhill (or uphill, depending on your perspective) fast.  Perhaps they were also enjoying making me squirm, particularly when they started with the pseudo-realistic ideas involving chainsaws.

One of the PFYs (""pimply-faced youths"", the youngest members of the team) ran off to go talk to his buddy on the manufacturing floor.  This buddy was a jovial, burly, cynical, tattooed, leather-wearing Harley rider who would LOVE to use expensive corporate equipment to smash other expensive corporate equipment to bits.  Probably even more than the techs that had been listening to upgrade whines for 6 months.  I liked the guy and the PFY, but I feared that the combination of adventure-seeking tech and danger-seeking equipment operator would get out of hand -- and if we weren't careful, someone might lose theirs.

Eventually when the techs ran out of steam with the ideas, I laid down three ground rules:

1) Nobody gets hurt

2) Data must actually be destroyed

3) Must be fast

Before too long, PFY returned with an ENORMOUS smile on his face, carrying two hard drives with large holes in the middle.  ""We tried it on the {ridiculously large} drill press, and it cut through them like putty!""  ""What's this white liquid on them?""  ""Oh that's the cooling liquid the drill automatically sprays on the things being drilled to keep from overheating.""

PFY and the rest of my team excitedly scampered off to the drill press to drill more holes in more drives.  I went over and watched a few with, yes, a smile on my face also.

But it all came crashing down when they tried the [press brake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_brake).  Our press brake was used to basically fold massive sheets of steel.  I'm not talking thin sheets like tin or something.  This was thick, hard steel, and it folded it like paper.  My techs (or perhaps their equally-entertained friends in the shop) had the idea of putting hard drives in the press brake, and bending them beyond recognition.

Unfortunately it transpired that hard drives in a press brake don't bend.  Or, at least they don't ONLY bend.  They also... explode.  Bits of hard drive flew out of the machine and went an ~~exciting~~ dangerous distance.

I wasn't there to witness, but my team was ecstatic about this effect.  ~~Unfortunately~~ Fortunately it was witnessed by a certain tight-sphinctered person with a clipboard and a reflective vest (I've [written about him before](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/a0k8cb/better_to_be_a_wuss_than_stand_in_a_puddle_of/)).  Thus ended the festivities.  Some on my team begged to keep doing it, saying ""it'll be fine if we just lay the drives down flat"" and ""we'll do it after-hours and even put up a safety sign!""  I said, ""Somehow I don't think a 'Caution: Exploding Hard Drives' sign will really solve this one.""

Since everyone involved had actually followed the company safety policy by wearing eye protection and so forth, my team got away with a verbal reprimand; same with the equipment operators.  But I had to officially forbid the team from using corporate equipment to pulverize magnetic-based non-volatile storage devices.

However, managers were only there during business hours, but the manufacturing area ran 24/7 with multiple shifts.  Some of my team, including PFY, worked an earlyish shift to help out with early-morning IT issues.  I couldn't help but notice that the stack of drives with holes in them was larger each morning when I walked in, and a poorly-concealed grin on PFY's face as he said ""good morning"" each day.

I grinned back and kept on walking to my desk.

Better not to ask.

Hey can you come here to put a charger in the middle of the night?,"So this story happend like 4 years ago and my father is OP, sorry for my grammar english isn't my first language and yada yada yada

Some informationMy father works as an informatic in a hospital and he sometime does this ""reachable"" (thanks to the comments, now i know it's ""on call) thing for some days which tbh I don't know a flip about but basically everyone in the hospital can call him at every, yes EVERY hour of the day if he as a problem with a pc (even if it doesn't start). This is counted as overtime and he gets paid more and if he do this for a week he gets a day home when he wants so totally worth it (he has like 60 days in account by now so if he wants a two months break he can take it and get paid). Ok i talked way too much, now onto the story

Ok it was 3 A.M. and my mom and dad are sleeping as well as i am in my room, right next to theirs. We all suddently wake, there's a loud noise, it was my father's phone ringing: the hospital. It pisses of but it happens less than once a month, no one calls at night, so he answers, now i'll write the conversation my dad told me.

D= dad
IN= idiot nurse


D: hello?

IN: hello is this *surname*?

D: yes, what seems to be the issue?

IN, i am at the end of my night shift and i need to write some report down before i go home but my the office pc doesn't start!

D: ok it had problems in the past days? The nurse before you said something about it don't working well?

IN: No anything! What do i do!?!? I need to sleeeeep!!

D: ok ok calm. What does the monitor say? 

IN: No signal. What does it mean (english isn't first language here so she didn't know)

D: ok *proceeds to tell her what no signal stands for and tries to solve the problem*

This goes on for about 15 mins and the pc won't start

Suddently my dad has a realization.

D: wait look under the desk

IN: ok what now?

D: is the charger in the power point?

IN: No? Should it?

D: *huff* Yes, or else the pc has no electricity to work

IN: Ewww but it's gross! There's too much dust! Can't you come here and put it in for me?

D: Are you kidding me? I am here to tell you what to do, not to do it, you are a damn nurse you should have some gloves! If you're so picky use them! BYE!
*Hangs up*

My dad was fuming and he was super tired and went back to sleep. The they after he told us the story and we all laughet about it.

That woman has some powers my dad never gets angry even with my EM (entitled mother) he stays calm (i should post about her on other subreddits) but this nurse was so dumb he couldn't do it anymore. Happy you reached the end! Have a good day!

"A whole production site down, for a simple error","I work IT support for an optician based in Paris, France. They have stores all over France and in a few other countries. They also have a subsidiary with a production site some distance away, still in Paris. This site is comprised of two buildings - relevant later.

August is an ""off-month"" for the whole company. Most activities go down, more than half the personnel is on vacation. Including the entire personnel of one building in the distant site, meaning that building is closed off.

Of course, that's when the troubles begin. We get a warning that the internet went down on the production site. Worse, the network materiel that we need to check is in the closed-off building. And, of course, the most mobile tech of the team is yours truly, because I'm on a bicycle, everybody else depends on public transportation. Going there takes me 25-30 minutes, by 38-40°C (Approx 100-104 F). Also I wear dark trousers because of the dress code.

I grab the keys of the closed-off building, only to find that it does open the metal curtain but not the main door. After searching a bit, the only option is to go back to the main site to find the other key. Another 25 minutes in scorching heat.

Turns out the guy who handed me the key thought he had four identical keys. Wrong, he had two sets of two different keys, and only gave me one. I gulp down a half liter of water and stash another in my bag - courtesy of the company. Back to the production site I go. Again, 25 minutes of rather intense pedaling under the merciless sun of early August.

Of course, opening the main door and the metal curtain did NOT end my troubles. The alarm was on, and the guy who administrated the alarm in most situations could not - it can be remotely administrated, but only when the internet works, which, of course, is the one thing that had gone down. He finally gives me a code that will get me in. Of course the damn thing is super-sensitive and if you take five more seconds than needed you get your ears blasted. Ah, well. It only lasted less than a second.

Finally able to get to work, I do the usual IT check ups. Power everything down, wait a bit, power it back up, so on. Nothing budges. I do note that the modem is stuck at a step in its power up sequence. I take note of everything, then back to the main site. Once there, I tasked one of my colleagues with contacting the internet service provider to see what was wrong, since that error code was for them. I, for my part, was done with my day and quite happy to be rid of that garbage for the day.

I'd spent my whole afternoon either on my bicycle or waiting for stuff to happen, with little AC anywhere. A couple hours after I got home, my colleague told me he'd found the crux of the matter :

The contract with the ISP had not been renewed, and of course the service had been cut. Even better : the service would take up to a week to be back up. It was a vital part of the still active production team's work, and it was completely inoperable.

&amp;#x200B;

TL, DR : A whole production site went down because someone had forgotten to renew the ISP's contract. Also forced me to do a lot of bicycling in August heat.

Reference to old school tech solution goes over head of younger network tech,"So this is my first ever post on Reddit. Been reading here for quite a while, but finally have an experience worth sharing.

So I work for a rather large organization in network operations. I am fairly new to the network side of things, but have almost 20 years IT experience.

I was at my desk making notes on some of the network tickets in my queue when I receive a call from one of our buildings saying they had no network connectivity in the whole building. I am unable to ping or SSH the switch. Check the distribution router. It showed the connection was down.

I headed out to the building and checked the switch. Logged in. Tried a few things (restart the connection to the distro, restart the whole switch, reseated the fiber, reseated the GBIC). None of that solved the connection problem. 

Sent a text to the boss to check what else I was missing and to check the fiber path. She texted back that sometimes the GBIC are like a troublesome Nintendo cartridge and that she would check the path. The younger guy (mid 20s) that I had with me looked at me confused and said he didn't understand what she meant by the Nintendo cartridge reference. I explained. We went to the distro router, I pulled the GBIC on the fiber that went to that building blew on it. Reseated it and the fiber and the glorious connection light came on for that interface. Logged into the distro and it showed the connection was up. Checked with the users at the building and they were all good.

When I got back to the office I told the boss (closer to my age) about the confusion with my coworker. We had a good laugh.",2415,0,1
"""It's where you would put the hat!""","Early 2000s, call center for  [Redacted] wireless, billing and support, I have LOTS of stories, but here's one of my favourites:

Had a customer call in angry right away (shocking I know) here's how the call went, I am paraphrasing a bit, as this was almost two decades ago:

Customer: MY PHONE IS BROKEN

Support(Me): Ok, what exactly is broken with it?

Customer: What do you mean!? It's broken, are you stupid or something!?

Me: Well, broken can mean a lot of things, can you please explain what YOU mean by broken?

Customer: The screen is dead! It doesn't even make a sound when I try to call people!

Me: Oh, see? This is why I ask what YOU mean by broken....A sound!? Like a dial tone? Cell phones don't have a dial-tone like home phones. Is it on? Is it charged?

Customer: I don't know what that means

Me: You've plugged it in?

Customer: I just got it, and the screen doesn't even work! AND I can't call anyone! This thing is useless!

Me: Okay, so it might not be charged, have you tried the power button?

Customer: I don't know what you mean, what power button!?

Me: Well, with cell phones, you need to turn them on, and they have batteries, so after a while the battery needs to be charged again.

Customer: So, what do I do!?

Me: Just press and hold the power button, it's on the top of the phone.

Customer (responding right away): Nothing happened

Me: You need to hold the power button for a few seconds for it to turn on

Customer (responding right away): Nothing happened

Me: I don't think you're pressing it for long enough, press and hold the top of the phone for at least 3 LONG seconds

Customer: OK, What do you mean by 'the top'?

Me (confused): Like...um...The top...? Not the front... or the sides... or the bottom... or the back... but the top...

Customer: It doesn't work!

Me: And you're pressing the top...?

Customer: I don't know!

*At this point I tried everything I could think of to try to explain what ""Top"" means, after about 5 minutes, of mind-numbing banter I can't remember I tried this:*

Me: Okay so... Put your finger on the screen...

Customer: yeah...

Me: Slide it UP! When you hit an edge, that's the top

Customer: Nothing happened

Me: Maybe we should go back to the store and see if something is broken, or if the people there can see what's wrong with the phone.

Customer: I CAN'T DO THAT

*I had one last idea to try to get her to understand what top meant:*

Me (Sad for humanity and tired): Okay... So... Look at your phone...

Customer (not angry now, just more embarrassed): okay...

Me: Your phone isn't a phone anymore, it's a person, the screen is it's face...

Customer: okay, I can see that....

Me: OKAY, so the top is Where you would put the hat!

Customer: OH! IT'S WHERE YOU WOULD PUT THE HAT!

*a few second later, I hear the phone's ""booting sound""*

Customer: Okay, Okay, I got it!

Phone goes straight to voicemail (it doesn't.),"Sorry if there's any formatting issues, this is the first time I've done a big written post on Reddit.

Background: So I work at a small business MSP and we service about 7-8 Clients and I'm the only tech in charge of all of these clients, so I'm essentially managing 7 business daily while hoping none of them explodes on me.

One of my Clients (A Doctor's Office) calls me today stating that their phone system is not working properly, and that all calls are being routed to voicemail immediately.

Lovely people in story:

- $Zexion: The Poor sap that has to deal with this daily
- $FD: Front Desk Receptionist that told me the system is down



So I had gone to their office this morning to supervise on an ISP transition and make sure everything went through fine. $FD Tells me in passing that she's not receiving any calls. Our first conversation went a little like this:

&gt; $FD: $Zexion I think I'm not receiving any calls, the phone isn't ringing, but I have a voicemail!

&gt; $Zexion: Well That's probably because the internet just went down due to $ISP installing their modem, It's probably fine

&gt; $FD: Could you still confirm that it's working?


At which point I decide to call all 3 of their numbers (They have 3 numbers that all route to the same system) and I'm greeting with their Auto-Attendant system 

&gt; Thank you for calling $Clinic, please dial 1 for Reception


I dial 1 &amp; the phone rings and the call goes through (on all 3 numbers btw), so I tell her it's operating fine.

I get back to the office and I get yet another call from her, telling me the phone system isn't working again. At this point it's almost 2pm and I'm eating a Pizza for lunch, so I give here about 10m before I start taking a deeper look at it.

So I do the exact same thing I did earlier in the morning, Dialed all 3 numbers, pressed 1, and the call went through. Told the other receptionist that picked up the call that it's working fine and she can let $FD know that it's working fine.

I get **ANOTHER CALL** at 3pm from her, Irate, telling me that the phone system is *STILL* giving her issues. This time I have her call from her cellphone so I can hear this exact issue that she's having.

&gt; $FD: Look let me call from my cell, you'll see it goes straight to voicemail!

&gt; *Dials #*

&gt;""Thank you for calling $Clinic, please dial 1 for Reception""

&gt; $Zexion: Sounds like it's working fine for me, that's how it always goes through, you have to dial 1 afterwards.

&gt; $FD: It never worked like that however, It would always just ring my phone!

&gt; $Zexion: It *does* ring your phone, it does so *after* you press 1.

&gt;$FD: Just fix it already! I know what I'm talking about, it's never dialed this stupid system!

&gt;*$FD Then hangs up on me*



At this point I'm getting extremely infuriated so I decide to just make it so all numbers just immediately dial the front desk, with 0 impunity. I then give her a call to verify functionality.

&gt; $Zexion: *Dials*

&gt;$FD: Everything's working now! Thanks :)

&gt;*$FD Hangs up*


I hate this job.

User is trying really hard to be relevant in front of the boss,"So we're releasing an internal tool for sales and the IT director sent a mass email to various people with access so they can test it before we do the final release. Included in this mail was the founder/ceo, other dept directors as well as all sales managers and some top executives.

On that email the CEO Replied All reminding everyone that to test the tool and send us any feedback bugs suggestions etc. even the minor ones so they're fixed before everyone starts using it.

This morning I received in the same Reply to All chain a series of some blowhards just replying ""Ok"" and ""I'm aware"", and one small bug one exec sent about a link being wrong, but everyone hitting Reply All so the CEO, directors, managers, all the IT team, etc. gets copied

I fix the bug and anounce it, along with one Reply All of my own reminding everyone to not send individual bugs to the Reply All chain, instead using the regular ticketing system we have for these matters.

I **immediately** receive a new ticket notification, like 5 minutes after, of someone else just forwarded the original email about the link being wrong to the ticketing email creating a new ticket OF THE VERY SAME TICKET I ANNOUNCED WAS ALREADY FIXED with a FYI note.

I'm like, dude it's me. Not only I'm failing to figure out the thinking process this guy went to in thinking he's actually doing something of value instead of just creating extra work for someone else (creating a ticket for a bug that's already fixed and he knows this) but the guy that created the ticket was not even the original person who reported it.",210,0,1
I'm sure it's in here somewhere...,"A story from my time in tech retail at a cellular dealership.

A customer was in wanting to make some changes to her account.  The kinds of changes she wanted to make required verifying her identity, so I asked for some ID.

Customer: Oh yes, I should have that here somewhere!

And she began a pocket dump.  But this was no ordinary pocket dump.  You see, it was summertime, she was rather well-endowed, and was wearing a low-cut top.  I don't know if this is common in larger centers, but in our small town (less than 2000 people) it's very normal for women to carry things like cell phones and smaller items tucked underneath their bra straps.  It's so common that it's completely normalized, and really treated no different than someone pulling something from their pocket.

But in this case it was more than just a phone under a bra strap.  You know how there's always that guy who only wears cargo pants and carries all manner of EDC gear in the pockets everywhere he goes?  Or that experienced mother-of-four with a bottomless handbag full of child-rearing equipment?  It was like that, but she carried it all inside her bra.

First her phone, then a pack of gum, then lipchap, a notepad, a pen, a second pen, another pack of gum, her husband's phone, a small wallet, a changebag, a small utility knife...and it just kept going.  After the first three or four items she decided it would be easier to rest her chest on the counter and tilt forward, attempting to dump everything out, or at least make it easier to pull things out.  Then it seemed that some items had fallen down underneath, so she had to plunge her hands in and root around to dig everything else out.  All with me looking on, trying to keep my customer service face in place.

Finally she managed to find her driver's license buried somewhere in a corner.  I thanked her for the trouble, verified her ID, and made the requested changes to her account while she loaded everything back into her improvised equipment carrier.",181,0,1
The lady who doesn’t know how many email addresses she has,"I provide level 1 tech support for a mobile app. We have plenty of active users and are a small team so we can only provide support over email. Due to large amount of emails we receive, it’s not always possible to reply to all of them on the same day, but we strive to answer to customers in less than 24 hours. A few days ago, an angry Karen reached out to us in regards to a problem with her account. The conversation went as follows: 

Angry Karen: hello, I was logged out from my account and when I try to log back in, your app says my account doesn’t exist. 

Me: hello! What’s the email address tied to your account?

Angry Karen: *shares email address 1*

Me: hmm I’ve checked on our system and we don’t have any accounts under that email address. Can you please share with me all possible email addresses you might have used to register with us? It would be helpful if you could also provide your full name so I can try more searching criteria. 

Angry Karen: *only shares another email address (email 2)* that’s the only other email I have, I truly don’t have any other email addresses. 

Me: I’m afraid we don’t have any accounts with that email either. Can you please share your full name?

Angry Karen: well, I was able to recover my account but the service could’ve been quicker.

Players: me and angry Karen (AK)

Me: Hello and welcome to the gas company tech support, how may I help you?    
AK: Goddamnit finally I've been waiting on this line for 5-10 minutes.    
Me thinking this not gonna be good: *oh boy, here we go again.*    
AK: So my father's cannot connect to anything, electricity doesn't work.

AK: What ID number? What the heck is that? I just want you to send a technician or someone, my father's been waiting from the morning and it's now 5 PM. Do something!    
Me: Ma'am please, let's take it slow. Can I at least know your father's surname?    
AK: John Doe

AK: You know what? You are an incompetent worker and you should find a new job. I'm gonna get you fired since you're not helping me at all.

At this point I quickly realized that AK was the customer of my client and called the wrong number. So I looked for the general infoline of the gas company not caring further about the issue and just wanted to transfer the call over there. AK proceeds to ramble demanding my name and threatened me. I didn't care at all since all she could do is yell, threaten me and tell me: ""I'm one of the most incompetent persons on Earth"". It's beyond my comprehension where she got the number from, a number intended ONLY for the end users and not for the customers of the company. AK couldn't misdial as both numbers are very different. And they definitely couldn't find it on the web since our number is only visible from the intranet. But I pity that poor soul who received the transferred call.",1265,0,1
My boss says it’s a firewall issue,"Hey, all. 2nd time poster. Just had one of those surreal experiences reminding me why I sink my evil developer tentacles into great IT people and never let go. 

$t1: Tier 1 Support

$hero: My light, my guide, my Tier 3 friend who knows everything

$me: Some random guy, totally unrelated to the story

So, I have an auth token, I have a company laptop, I have a client VM. All is well in the kingdom. Then it’s time to re-enroll the token, and the gremlins invade. 

To re-enroll, I have to use a shared client VM which I reach from my dedicated client VM which I reach from my company laptop...  Yeah. This’ll go smoothly. 

3 tries later, the re-enrollment VM recognizes the cert but the dedicated VM and the laptop say there’s nothing to be found. 

One 3 hour call to the Service Desk later and $t1 has pinpointed the issue. 

$t1: Ok. The cert is clearly on the token, but it’s not getting imported into your laptop’s store. This happens with remote access. You need a client laptop, because clearly your company laptop doesn’t work with tokens. 

$me: Not to second guess you, but it worked for over a year until I had to re-enroll. You sure?

$t1:  It did?  Huh. Well, my boss says when this happens, it’s a firewall issue on your machine, but he doesn’t know what. So, you must have changed the firewall. 

$me: I really don’t think...

$t1: Yeah. Something changed your firewall settings and you just can’t use that laptop to connect anymore. You need a new machine. 

$me:  Ok...  Thanks. 

I grew up in rural Michigan where cattle are raised, and there was a familiar scent in the air, so...

$me: Uh, $hero, I know you’re busy, but...

$hero: Let me look. 

&lt;5 minutes later&gt;

$hero: Ok. Yeah. See the output from certutil says no certs on the token?  That’s because there are no certs on the token. Your laptop is fine, it’s the cert that’s missing. Try re-enrolling one more time and maybe sacrifice a chicken. If that doesn’t work, go onsite, plug into a client machine and re-enroll. All good. 

$me: Thank you!  You rock!  It’s funny actually. Not to speak ill of the Service Desk guy, but he told me it was a firewall issue on *my machine* preventing imports...

$hero: Yeah, the Tier 1 guys are funny sometimes. I just took a call from someone who bought a brand new laptop because Tier 1 said her old one couldn’t be fixed.  Now her old one is working fine and her new one is a really nice paperweight.

Don't fall asleep in class,"First time poster, I hope it's suitable. A short one but there's a Tldr at the end too. 

For context, I'm not tech support, but when I was in high school I was labelled tech support by teachers and students. I'm computer literate and figure stuff out as I go, the actual technicians at my old school were 10/10, much respect for them. But during lessons, the first port of call was me and I'm not even that good. Heck, some lessons didn't even start until I walked in (even when I was late) bc they were waiting for me to help them. 

Cut to the story, one day I was in a biology lesson with a brilliant teacher whose voice, unfortunately,  put me to sleep pretty much every lesson. One time as I am waking up from a slumber, the class is quiet and I'm terrified- was I caught sleeping? Did the teacher notice? Oh sh- but then I hear mumbling and see the teacher struggling with their laptop. Relief. 
In my half lucidity, I ask ""do you need a hand with that?"" They very much accepted. 

Turns out it was a simple problem, they had their laptop extended to an external monitor and the projector screen was meant to mirror the monitor, it currently wasn't doing that.

Within about 30s, I had gone into the display settings and fixed it and taught them how to do it too, lest they forget it. And as I am about to walk away, they then tell me of another problem. Their file explorer wasn't opening at all. After verifying this (you gotta) and doing some troubleshooting, I figured I'd ask if they had updated their laptop recently. Nope, of course not. I gently told them to update it and then went on my merry way back to my seat.
Another nap successful! And some more simple problems sorted! 

TL;DR I was sleeping in class, woke up to quiet. Got scared that I was caught sleeping. Turns out teacher was struggling with extending their screen to the projector and also hadn't updated their laptop. Typical suspects.",157,0,1
Clueless users and I DO NOT KNOW WHAT URL MEANS,"Certain details and exact wordings changed to hide identities.

Some background, I work as an IT technician for a group of companies. While I am paid by one of them, I do work for all and those hours get billed back by the company I am paid by.

The largest of these companies is a real estate company that sometimes provides other services to its commercial tenants. In the case of one of its tenants our CEO is a partial owner of it they said we will help them to upgrade their computer equipment since much of it was on 10 year old computers running windows 7.

All things considered the upgrade went very smooth, we had a few hiccups with some custom $Software that needed to be configured on site using internet explorer ONLY (yes not even edge) and then needed the software vendor to do some things after each user logged in for the first time. However, other than that the computer deployment was easy enough.

We had to hold off on one of their higher ranking employees because of some custom software that needed a code to activate. I am not sure of her title but lets call her $CAPS since every email she types to me is in all caps.

Before we deployed the computers I had to email chain with $CAPS on it where we were going over the extent of our work at this site.

&gt; Me: (Random technobabble and background information after the initial conversations outlining what needs to be upgraded also mentioning how $Software vendor manages a lot of their network equipment and has a very weird IP range)

&gt; My Manager: Okay, let me know when you want to go there and I will join you to help figure it out.

&gt; $CAPS: OKAY I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A PROCESS WE HAVE TO TALK TO ($SOFTWARE VENDOR) TO HAVE THEM WALK US THROUGH THE INSTALLATION OF THE PROGRAM

Since this was the first time I talked with her I assumed she was yelling and thinking we were chickens running with our heads cut off. Eventually I learned she is just clueless with computers and we began to deploy them. Yesterday we finally finished setting up $CAPS' computer and transferring the files over to it. She had a minor issue with some printers but we were able to solve that remotely.

Today I received an email:

&gt; $CAPS: GOOD MORNING $USER IS HAVING ISSUES WITH HIS COMPUTER HE SAYS ALL 3 COMPUTERS ARE SLOW

(Thinking to myself: Who is $User? I don't think that person was any of the people who's computers we replaced and why does a person have 3 computers?)

&gt; Me to my manager: What is the extent of our relationship with this company, since hours are being billed back I don't want to get in trouble making a site visit (the site is 5 minutes from my office and I have nothing else going on. I really just didn't want to have to deal with this company any more)

&gt; My manager on the initial email chain: We do not have remote access to that person's computers or your network. What we can do is request those computers be on the next round of upgrades.

&gt; $CAPS: THESE ARE (BRANDNAME) COMPUTERS. I GUESS WE CAN REACH OUT TO BRANDNAME TO UPGRADE THEM

I look up Brandname and find that they make mini handheld tablets for this company's industry and manage them fully. I inquire a bit with a coworker who knows a bit more about how this company operates and he informs me that these are leased devices and plenty powerful for what they need to do. As I get ready to respond $User enters the chain.

&gt; $User: Since they worked on the computer it has been slow

&gt; $Me: Since who worked on your computer? Also these computers are managed by BRANDNAME and they will be the ones to call if you are having issues with their devices

&gt; $User: From what my department is telling me that $Software has been slow since they worked on it

&gt; Me: In that case talk to $Software vendor (I am assuming that the software vendor is the ""they"" he is talking about) and they will be able to look into it. - remember $Software vendor manages their network too

At this point I am thinking to myself that this is the end of having to deal with that company and me and my coworkers are talking about putting them in contact with a local MSP to see if they can sign a contract since we really aren't going to be providing ongoing support after the hardware upgrade is done. About 10 minutes after the last email chain ended I get another message:

&gt;$CAPS: PLEASE HELP ME I NEED TO ACCESS BANKING APPLICATION AND I CAN NOT FIND IT

&gt; Me: I am not aware of how anything works on your applications. All your applications should be installed and your files transferred over in the same spots they were before. I also transferred your Internet Explorer Chrome and Edge bookmarks (yes she used all 3) but if this is done on the secure banking browser I can not access those settings to transfer over. You will have to find the link or type the URL manually.

&gt; $CAPS: I DO NOT KNOW WHAT URL MEANS AND IT IS A DOWNLOAD FROM $SOFTWARE

&gt; Me: We do not have any access to $Software, for support using it please contact them.

This woman has been working for this company for years and they never had any official IT support. We come in and within a few weeks suddenly they can't even do their jobs any more. I feel sorry for whoever their contact is at $Software vendor and the techs at the local MSP if they choose to sign with it. (I worked with one of their guys after we had a major ransomware attack on our company and needed to rebuild a whole server in an emergency and he was very good.)
For a while I thought that people like this didn't exist in the wild and definitely not in management positions. Do people get worse once they can blame their computer issues on someone else?

This was my first semester working and I wasn't yet accustom to how insane people can be.  I cut down a lot of the following exchange to keep it simple.
An older women approached my desk with her laptop and introduced herself as a professor.

Lady: ""I don't remember my login to iTunes, could you help me?""

Me: ""Sure lets use the forgot password button.  Can you type in your email?  It will send you an email so we can make a new password""

She types in her university email and I navigate to the university email login page for her.

Me: ""Okay!  Can you sign into your email for me?""

Lady: ""um.. I don't know my password for this""

Me: ""For your university email?  Okay well I can reset it for you through our IT system, do you have an ID I can see to verify your identity?""

Lady: ""I didn't bring my wallet with me!""

I stare at her large purse she has hanging from her shoulder...

Me: ""Ok well I guess we can do the forgot password option for your email too, please type your phone number in""

Her phone dings

Me: ""Great!  You should have a text with some numbers can you read them to me?""

Lady: ""I can't get to the text, I don't know my phones passcode""

Me: ""You don't know the passcode to your own phone??""

Lady: ""How am I supposed to remember so many passwords!""

At this point I'm pretty much out of options and explain for the next 15 minutes that there was nothing else I could do.  In my head I was questioning if this lady was really a professor or if she had just stolen this phone and laptop.

Me: ""Ma'am do you keep your passwords written down at home somewhere?  How do you normally open up your phone?""

Lady: ""Of course I do!  Here I have the paper in my purse!""
And she proceeded to pull out a piece of paper with every single password she needed, including the iTunes one...

I stood there shocked for a bit before helping her type in everything.  She had dozens of unread emails from her students since she appeared to have never logged into her email the entire semester.  But regardless she happily thanked me and walked away.

Whole exchange seriously lasted almost 30 minutes and made me question what kind of university I was at if we had professors like this one.

I have them power cycle the phone and call them on it - Nothing.  
I re-sync their connection to the switch and to our billing network - Nothing.  
The third page of our troubleshooting guide is:
&gt;""Check for packaging material, plastic film or foil on top of the screen.""

I almost skip it. A little bit of plastic film wouldn't completely goddamn deafen the speaker.
&gt;A little bit of plastic film wouldn't completely goddamn deafen the speaker.

My hand hovers over the 'Next' button in the guide.  
I ask anyways.

""Oh yeah it has the little screen plastic sticker on it from shipping, I was going to keep it there until I got my new screen protector.""

My eye twitches.  
I ask them to remove it, and call them back on the device.

&gt;A little bit of plastic film WOULD completely goddamn deafen the speaker.

The customer was floored, I was floored, we were both completely thrown that a thin little piece of plastic film would completely negate a speaker on the device.

And that's how I learned that every step is in the troubleshooting guide for a reason, and how I learned to trust the guide.",1851,0,1
IT Project Manager Schedules Reoccurring Meeting,"I work help desk for a factory and we have an IT Project Manager who hasn't a clue about IT what-so-ever.  This ticket came in about 10 minutes ago.  Introducing the people in my story:

The lying user that was accidentaly right,"I work in application maintenance. Fixing incorrect data in the DB, killing/restarting stuck processes, things like thay. All of which is done when asked to via ticket. The usual.

Anyway, I got a ticket the other day that could be summed up as ""Please do **$action** on **$list_of_things**"".  
Now, the thing is, we only work on anomalies. Meaning, if it's something that can be done via the interface, as a normal use of the application, then though luck, you're on your own. And it happens that the **$action** the user was asking me to do was doable with the interface.

Wasn't the first time I got a ticket like that. The application I work on is antiquated and a lot of actions are long and tedious, so sometimes when a user has to do these actions on a lot of stuff (as was the case here) they try to open a ticket in the hope that we'll do it instead of them. No dice though, I sent the ticket back explaining how to do **$action** (I learned that Hanlon's Razor was *very* applicable to my job) and moved to something else.

A while after, the ticket is reopened, with the user saying something to the effect of ""I did **$action** on a couple of **$things**, but then they didn't change state."". Yeah, RIGHT. 

I decide to check myself and pick one **$thing** to do **$action** on. Look, the button is there, not even greyed out... Fully prepared to answer the ticket with ""ok I literally just did it and it works so you can do it yourself you numbnut instead of expecting me to do your job for you"", I click on the button...  
And lo and behold, the widget it opens is completely broken. Normally you have a couple of fields to fill, then a button to click to validate. Here, the first field doesn't work at all, there is no button anywhere (can't even close the widget), and there's a bunch of HTML in a text field, which at a glance seems like it should be the rest of the page instead of being written inside a text field.

So, the user WAS lying. He told me he did **$action** and it had no effect. But he can't have done it because it doesn't work *at all*.  
In other word, this dude, in lying to try and get me to do his job for him, lucked out and got me to find an *actual* anomaly. I am baffled.

Still not gonna do his job for him though. He can do it himself once I've fixed the bug.",1858,0,1
"Wait, where are you putting your finger?","Good morning, good afternoon,  and good evening TFTS.

It appears the fruit company released an update that auto enables “App lock”. Meaning you need to unlock the app with your fingerprint, to allow the MFA prompt to show up on the device.

One of our older users had never setup their fingerprint on their fruit phone. I really do like this user, but they are not very technically savvy. Being remote, only makes the problem worse.

I get the ticket and give them a call. I get remoted onto their phone, after walking them through downloading the remote access app.

Walk them through setting up their fingerprint.

Have them open their MFA App, tell them to use their finger to unlock the App.

User: It’s not working.

Me: (Thinking to myself it should work, we just set it up. I then remember that I had to tell her where to place her finger when we set it up)

Me: Where are you placing your finger?

User: On the screen where it says, place finger.

Me: (Trying not to laugh) Nope, place your finger on the sensor at the bottom of your phone.

User: Oh yeah, right. That would make sense... Okay I’m in now.

Me: (Shows the user were to turn the setting off) Okay now you will not need to use your fingerprint to unlock your MFA app.

I love it when they threaten to figure it out for themselves.,"Caller: I'm looking in my outlook and a bunch of my emails are missing. 

Me: Ok, I'm looking at your Outlook data file and it's really really large. As that file grows larger and larger the chances for corruption increase. Short term we can scan and repair it. For a long term fix I recommend archiving old email to reduce the size of that PST file.  Remember...we talk about this about once a year and you say you hate archiving and you never want to do it because you lose emails? 

Caller: We've never talked about this before. 

Me: Yep, every time you have an Outlook problem. 

Caller: Well can you tell me how to archive my old email? 

Me: Do you still have the notes I asked you to take last time? 

Caller: YOU HAVE NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS!

Me: I have....repeatedly....for years. I'll be happy to step you through the process but please take notes so you can refer to them in the future. 

Caller: Forget it! I'll just figure it out on my own!

The missing mails,"Okay so this story happened today and is probably my favorite ticket this month. I could have maybe solved that one in a few seconds, but instead my brain chose the long path...

I'm working for a construction company, and my job is basically taking care of everything that whispers ""IT""... You know what I mean. 

So today a construction manager called me, because he had problems with some mails. He usually gets all his mails on his computer in Outlook and on his iPhone in the mail app.

But for whatever reason some mails were only displayed on his iPhone, and not on his computer. Which seemed weird, as both devices are connected with our Exchange server and test mails arrived at both devices.

Well, so the trouble shooting began. Firewall, spam filter, exchange protocolls - looked good. Mails were not present in OWA as well. 

So by then I noticed, that all the ""missing"" mails came from the same guy. So I took a closer look at those mails. And in those mails, somewhere inbetween 15 other recipients, there was [""cmanager@icloud.com](mailto:""cmanager@icloud.com)"". No [""c.manager@construction-company.com](mailto:""c.manager@construction-company.com)"".

I felt kinda stupid after noticing this after \~15 minutes of trouble shooting, but eh. :D",107,0,1

The printer isn't working! You need to come in immediately!,"I'm an intern for a company right now and IT isn't actually my job, but I'm very Tech savvy. My work got laptops for everyone and I told them I could easily transfer their files from old computer to the new ones. Basically just a copy and paste job. So I copy and paste files from old computers to the new laptops and then head home. The staff isn't fully using these laptops yet as we had to purchase microsoft word and there isn't wifi set up in the building yet. So the laptops aren't fully ready to go yet. The next day is my day off when I get awoken by my phone ringing. I answer and one of my coworkers tells me that Janes computer isn't printing.

Me: Her new laptop isn't printing?

Coworker: yea its not printing.  
Me: Just tell her to print from her Old computer, everything is still hooked up.

COworker: she says her old computer isn't printing either.

Me: Well that's weird, I didn't do anything that should have effected her printer.  
Coworker: We need you to come in right now and fix this.  
ME: Sure, I'll be right there, can I talk to Jane?

Jane: Hello my computer isn't printing

Me:Did you try printing from your old computer

Jane:Yes I did and nothing came out of the printer

Me:OKay, because nothing should have changed on your old computer so it hypothetically should be able to print. the new laptop isn't set up yet though. You're not trying to print from the laptop, right?

Jane: No I'm not on the laptop, both computers aren't printing.

Me:Did any thing pop up or any windows open saying low ink or error

Jane: No nothing popped up

Me:Okay is the printer on?

Jane yes its on

Me: OKay is the printer name listed when you open the document to print

Jane: I don't know

Me: okay Maybe it got disconnected. I can come take a look but I didn't do anything that should have effected your printer. So If its a major issue then we will have to call the printer maintenance guys.  


After that point I get to the office and go into her office I see her laptop open and her desktop has a black screen. I go to the desktop and wiggle the house but it stays black.   
Jane: It was like that when I came in! I don't know whats wrong with it.  
Me: It looks like its turned off

Jane: I didn't do that. I never turn my computer off. 

Me: (realizing that jane 100% did not actually try printing from her desktop computer and wondering if she just lied during our entire conversation where I had her walk me through step by step as she tried to print) Well I turned it off after I finished working on it yesterday.  


I then turn the computer on by pressing the power button and the log in screen opens

Me: Can you type your password in for me

Jane: I don't know the password.   
ME: Its probably the same password you normally use for everything  
Jane: (rummages through her desk until she finds a sticky note) I've never had to log in before. I don't ever turn the computer off.

I log in, open word and immediately print.

&amp;#x200B;

Jane: Oh My GOD! You fixed the printer!!!!

Me: Uh yea, Jane, do you know how to turn the computer on?

Jane: No, I don't need to though since I just never turn it off. 

Everything starts to click into place for me and all the comments from jane about how slow her computer was running come to mind. I then show her the power button and then go to our boss who I inform that the issue was resolved and that the issue was that Jane didn't know how to turn her computer on. This alarms my boss who then at the next meeting informs everyone that they should be turning their computers off at least once a week.  


I go to my coworker's office and let her know that Janes real problem isn't the printer but the fact she doesn't know how to turn computers on. I at this point am in almost complete disbelief that people in my office who use computers every single day have no idea how to do something so basic as turning on the computer. Mind-blowing. But then again there is a woman who is a couple of years away from retiring who doesn't know the alphabet (American born and raised, only knows the English language and went to public school) and I know there are a lot of people who don't understand computers but I figure that if you use a computer every single day, all day long, you should probably know the basics. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR; Got called into work on my day off because my coworker didn't know how to turn on her computer and apparently has never turned a computer on or off before.

Why would you need data in the new building?,"Context: I'm a Senior Engineer in a secondary school, and have co-managed the IT department for the past year and a half.

This is one of those stories where I am absolutely stunned that it even happened. It may sound made up. It may seem unbelievable. But I assure you it is not. The threshold for human stupidity is absurdly vast.

It's also a long one, so I apologise.

Buckle your seat belts, this is going to get wild.

Background: 
Last year the school I work in managed to secure funding from the local council for renovations and expansions to the campus. Due to local primary schools taking on more children, it's had a knock on effect and our student body has increased by an average of 30 students per year over the past four years. That may not sound like much, however that's a whole classroom of kids extra every year. So, of course, we needed to expand.

It started out with the erection of 12 pods in the open areas of the school - not too big, but big enough to fit 12 students in comfortably. Perfect for Sixth Form lessons. The only problem is that they are made of metal, have built in air-con units mounted on the top, and were directly in the paths of a number of our wireless access points. So our wireless signal suffered as a result.

If they had consulted my department, I would have told them that it may have happened and would have prepared to reconfigure the setup ahead of time. Alas, they did not and so I ended up having to rush to do it, after I found out about the plans. At first the school's account holder (the Deputy Head) was reluctant to spend the money to reconfigure the wireless setup and it got held up. However, after complaints started pouring in he signed off on the funding. Not the way I would have liked things to go down, but you live and learn. All in all it turned out better than expected. (He was so shocked by how badly the signal was affected, and the complaints that we forwarded on, that he even agreed to upgrade our access points, which I was glad about since they were EOL pending and weren't accepting any firmware updates. - Yippee)

After this was all resolved I had a meeting with the Head, Deputy Head and Business Manager and told them that if there was any building work in the future they should consult with myself or someone else on my team during the planning stage. Purely so that we could avoid anything like this happening again.

They agreed.

They, my friends, *lied.*

And so our story begins:

Deep into lockdown, I got a call on my personal mobile from from the Deputy Head at about 9.30pm. My usual work day finishes at 4. Naturally, I let it ring out. I don't like answering work calls outside of work hours as I believe it breeds dependancy. But he called again. So I figured it was either something Covid-related, or at least urgent in some other way.

DH: I'm really sorry for calling you at home, but it's an emergency. Are you okay to talk? 

Me: Yeah, I'm fine. What's up?

DH: I just signed the paperwork for a new building and I want to know what we need.

Me: Excuse me? I didn't know a new building was planned. Where is it going? When's the work start? Why haven't I heard about this before?

DH: I was keeping it a secret to surprise staff coming back after the summer. Only Senior Leadership, and now you, know. Its replacing the temporary hut out the back of the canteen. Work starts Monday.

At this point my bullshit detector starts going off something *fierce.* Monday was four days away, and no way would him signing the paperwork that night already have that start date organised. My best guess is that he signed everything weeks ago, and then before the work started realised he hadn't contacted me.

After some questioning I find out that this new building is going to have 6 rooms, spread over two floors, with one of the rooms being used for our GAP program, so that will need at least 5 PCs in it. There is also going to be another smaller one room building next to it that will be used as an office.

I tell him straight up, he can't transplant the data from the old hut into the new building. The hut had a rack, but a small one, and only had a normal switch in it. For a building of that size, and with the office next door, he would need a Power Over Ethernet switch - for phones (we use VOIP) and wireless APs. It would also need to be managed, so that I can configure and assign the VLANs. In addition it would need aircon in the room that the switch is in to keep it cool, as well as the 5 PCs, three wireless APs at least, and a 65"" television in each room so that teachers can display their lesson PowerPoints. The only things we could salvage from the old hut are the physical data run from the server room, and the cabinet the old switch was in.

He agrees with my recommendations and asks me to order the necessary equipment the next day. He also tells me he will speak to our Site Manager about organising the data to be included in the plans.

Needless to say I trust this man about as far as I can throw him. So after I put my orders in I go and speak to the site manager myself.

Our building is not owned by the school, but leased from a Third Party Company, so the site manager works for them and any building work or physical maintenance needs to go through her.

Me: Hey, SM has DH contacted you about the data in the new building?

SM: No. What data?

*deep breath*

Me: We need data included in the plans, so that it all works. I've got wireless APs and phones and computers to go in, so I need the data sorted.

SM: There's no data on the floorplan and construction plans.

Me: Let's have a look.

She was right. No data cabling. No Ethernet ports. No space to put the cabinet. Nothing. NOTHING.

Me: F@ck. This all needs to be there. It won't function as anything more than a holding pen otherwise.

SM: The school didn't budget for any of that. And works all ready to go after the weekend. You'll need to speak to senior leadership and get them to contact the building company about all of that.

So I meet with SLT about what's happened. I can tell from the looks on their faces they have no idea what the hell I'm taking about. So I use small words. I write it down and talk them to forward what I've written to the company. Eventually they agree to contact the building company and use my specifications. 

Work starts and I assume its all in order. I program my switch, I add my APs to Radius, I get my apprentice to image the PCs, I test the phones. All looking good.

Periodically I check with the site manager for an update as I'm not allowed on the building site. All going well I'm told. Splendid. 

Until one day the manager of the building works comes up to me and asks what's going on with data.

I appear confused. It's two weeks before the summer is over. The kids will be back soon. We need the extra space for social distanced learning. What does he mean? We sorted the data, right? I show him my email I forwarded to SLT.

""Nah, never seen that.""

He shows me the plans they were working off. No data. At all. 

Not only that, when they were working they found the old physical data run to the old hut and ripped it up because they didn't know what it was. The also binned the old cabinet. And switch - a perfectly fine Aruba.

Holy. Shit.

I called the Deputy Head, and told him what was going on, in a panic.

DH: Oh no, I think we might have forgotten that. Is it that important?

*Is this man for real?*

One person forgetting this I could forgive. Not understand, but forgive. Maybe two.

But senior leadership is 9 members. I spoke to all of them. I gave them the specifications - they literally just had to forward them. I spoke to the site manager regularly. Why didn't she realise it was forgotten?

What?

*WHAT??*

I now have no location to put the switch. No cabinet. No data run from my servers. No air con. No Ethernet ports anywhere. No data of any kind!

Teachers cant teach there. They all use laptops, and we have no external WiFi on that side of the building. And even if we did I doubt it'd be very stable. Nowhere to plug in computers. So all our GAP students can't have lessons. No ports for phones. So the office staff in the small building next door can't work.

How? How does something so essential go through so many hands and still get forgotten? 

How do you build a whole building, with the intent to use data in it, and everyone bar myself just forget that it NEEDS DATA?!

I feel like I've gone completely mad.",750,1,1
We don't want to be FIRED for doing YOUR job!,"First time post. I'm not the best at story telling but here it is my story from an experience I had. 

Players: Nice Lady (NL), Rude Lady (RL), Me

So I work for an MSP as tech support. I got a call from a client in an offsite location where only two ladies worked. The first lady, which was fairly nice with the whole situation, called in about 3 different issues. I went through the first two issues and resolved them fairly quickly. But oh boy, when the 3rd issue came up, things got a little more intense.

The third issue related to a kiosk computer connected to a touch screen TV. 

NL: Okay, and the third issue is the kiosk computer. It isn't connecting to the internet. 

Me: I can help you with that. What are you seeing on the screen?

NL: I see .... (lists a bunch of different things)

Me: That sounds like it is the TV menu. Can you find the input on the TV and select HDMI?

NL: Sure. \*mumbles to herself as she goes through the TV menus\* Okay, got it! I see some tiles now.

Me: So you can see Windows now?

NL: Yeah, but it's saying it isn't connected.

Me: Okay, do you see the internet icon on the bottom right of the task bar?

At this point she says no and tried to describe what she sees which sounded completely foreign to me. I don't know what she is looking at. I was thinking maybe she was looking at that Windows tile screen that you might see on tablets and I was trying to get her to the desktop. After several minutes of her trying to describe the screen and me trying to guide her to the desktop, RL jumped in and started talking with so much attitude.

RL: This is taking WAY too long. You guys need to fix this! We don't want to get fired because YOU can't do your job! We don't have time for this. We have things to do. We don't have all day to do your job for you.

Me: I apologize this is taking some time but I need you to get to the desktop so we can get you connected to the WIFI.

NL: I found some WIFI settings. \*proceeds to say what she sees\*

Me: That sounds like the WIFI menu for the TV. Have you tried restarting the computer? (in IT when all else fails, try rebooting)

NL: Yes, we did that.

RL: This is ridiculous. You need to get this fixed! Help me, help you! (in a very condescending tone) What are we paying you for?

There were other rude and condescending lines like that, that I can't really remember. At that point, I escalated the issue to our senior admin, because I was at a loss and RL was just getting more and more upset. I mean, if you can't even get to the desktop, I don't know what to do for you. So I informed my admin about the whole situation and he called them some time later. 

Before he called them I was talking about it with my colleague, just kind of laughing it off. ""I bet the computer wasn't even on and they were just looking at the TV menus."" LOL. Moments later my admin lets me know that the computer wasn't on and they apologized to me. I'm certain it was the NL that said that. You could tell she felt bad as RD was unleashing her fury upon me.

This was confusing at the moment because she said she saw Windows and she said SHE RESTARTED THE COMPUTER! If the computer was off the whole time, what did she restart? Apparently, she just turned the TV off and back on! \*facepalm\*",156,0,1
The 2-step hurdle,"I just had a fun phonecall at work.

We're a small IT support company with around 10 employees supporting all types of businesses small to medium in size

A user couldnt get into the terminal server remotely.
She could enter credentials, get to the 2step authenticator hosted on the terminal server, but when she entered it the connection reportedly disappeared.
We remote in and are looking into a few things and trying different things.
Reset the remote login precedure, make sure she isn't still logged into the server, reboot the laptop she remotes in from and ask her to try again.
And for a brief moment I see what happened when she entered her 2-step code.

She presses ""back"" instead of ""authenticate"" after entering the code...

It was hard to spot initially because we don't see the cursor when the client moves it.
When I asked her why she would press back instead of authenticate she got really embarrased and apologized profusely.

But I need this plug where I am going,"This is a really old story... Like early '90s. 
  
Networking was new, DOS was king, and Windows 2.1 would occasionally surface. I was in a Big Iron Shop (Mainframe, for the new kids on the block) and would help out with PC problems in the area. (My director was impressed that I used a Macintosh in university, so clearly I knew everything about PCs. I, realizing that agreeing to him meant that I would get the second PC on the floor, kept my mouth shut.)
  
By the way, the director had me set up his PC. And was tooting my skills to all of his director friends, and billing them for my work. 
  
So the adjacent group has set up a printer network... For the youn'uns, back then, PCs looking to print to a shared printer, would be connected through the SERIAL port to a network with a dedicated print server and printer. Boys and girls... Notice that there was no network as you know these days. There was a cable to print, and the equivalent of a network card to plug in the coax to the mainframe's modem. 
  
The adjacent group bought a custom solution for printing involving a custom plug with a port that looked like an RJ45 port, but wasn't. Because computers were new, this was before standards. (And, later, was denied as an acceptable standard.) 
  
And back to my director... He arranged with the director of the adjacent group that I would be their tech support.
  
And then the manager of said group was posted elsewhere. And he negotiated that he would keep his PC. Big deal given that he would have received a mainframe terminal otherwise. My job was to pack up the PC for shipping. Up two floors and down the corridor.
  
I disconnected everything and boxed up the parts that would go with him. Except for that funny little connector that permitted him to connect to the print server. Which I put in the box to remain behind.
  
Full freak out... That was his! He bought it with his department's funds. He absolutely needed it where he was going. I was equally adament that this was purely for him to connect to the printing network functioning at this location. Any connection needed at his new place would be provided there. It wasn't our responsibility to provide wiring from here to his new place so he could print here. He had negotiated that the computer was to go and this was connected and therefore part of the computer. 
  
I was nearly written up for insubordination... Except he wasn't in my chain of command. So he couldn't. However, he kept the plug. And his old director had to buy a new one at a cost of (I believe) $350 for the person moving into his old office.
  
And did he use said plug? Nope, absolutely never. It was mailed to me five months later. Not to his old director, I add. 
  
I was amused to hear that, during the radiator cleaning shortly thereafter, he insisted on watching the cleaners and therefore found himself doused by dirty water as the rad was cleaned with a high pressure hose. And, before you ask, I was on vacation that week.

He would be retired by now. Unless he isn't. But that was government.

Old man is abusive and gets banned from the store,"This has happened over the past few days, and I've aged 10 years from dealing with this man. For context, I work in tech support at a popular office supply store. 

This all started when this old man, maybe 70-75, brought in his old desktop along with a new one for a data transfer. That's all fine and dandy, we inform him we have a 3 day turn around time (we were pretty busy). Fast forward 3 days, and the customer calls and goes off the rails. He's screaming and cursing at my manager over the phone furious that it wasn't done in only a day because ""there's no data on the old one."" I could hear him over the phone and I was standing 20 feet away.

Somehow we managed to get him off the phone, and like we told him, his computer was done on that third day. He came and picked it up, looking it over first and signing off on a waiver saying that the service was done properly. All ends well, right? Wrong, it's only just getting fun.

The next day (today), he calls and is INSTANTLY screaming when I pick up. His ""wifi"" doesn't work. Turns out he meant his wireless keyboard, and it didn't work because it was still plugged into the old computer. 
Twenty minutes later he calls again... Also screaming. His background image isn't changing every 5 minutes, only once a day. Now I'd have helped him, except he refused to bring the computer back in. He demanded I fix it over the phone. I told him it wasn't possible, and he blows up on me cursing me out and screaming so loud I can't even understand him. He hangs up after a few minutes.
Another twenty minutes later he calls again, still screaming. Notice a pattern yet? This time he's mad because the off button on the computer isn't a shortcut on the desktop. I walk him through where the real button is. It's 3 clicks total.

""That's too complicated, I can't do that every time. Change it for me""

""Sir, that's how Microsoft designed windows 10, I can't change it.""

""What the **** do you mean? It has nothing to ****ing do with ****ing Microsoft, CHANGE IT!""

""I'm really sorry sir, but I ca-""

""I SAID ****ING CHANGE IT YOU PIECE OF ****, I DIDNT SPENT $90 FOR THIS ****TY SERVICE!""

""Sir if you're going to act like this I'll have to hang up.""

""NO YOU ****ING WONT, YOURE GOING TO ****ING FIX IT FOR ME, MY STEPSON SAID IT WAS POSSIBLE""

""Get your stepson to do it then, because I won't be treated like this.""

""I PAID GOOD MONEY FOR THIS SERVICE, SO YOU HAD BETTER ****ING FIX IT OR-""

""SIR, as respectfully as possible, DEAL WITH IT."" *I hang up while he's still yelling.*

He called back again a few minutes later and demanded to talk to a manager. He proceeded to scream at them too, and get hung up on several times. Eventually, after like 4 calls, my manager issued a refund to his credit card just to get him out of our hair.

Thankfully, that was the end of it. PSYCH. He called again an hour later, screaming that he hadn't gotten his refund yet. Everybody knows it takes like 4-7 business days for that stuff, but he didn't care. We had to fax him proof that it was issued.

We also, politely, informed him that he is no longer welcome here and that he has no right to mistreat our staff. 

""I WORKED IN RETAIL FOR YEARS AND NEVER ONCE HUNG UP ON SOMEBODY"" he told my manager, to which my manager said ""Then you never met anybody who acted the way you do.""

Almost every phone call was like 10 minutes of him screaming too, not short conversations. We tried to reason with him a thousand times. He wouldn't have it.

We didn't have a list of customers who we refuse to deal with. We do now.

Good riddance.

EDIT: After the initial transfer he was happy and actually tipped me. He wanted to know where I live so that I could do side work, which I didn't tell him. REALLY happy I didn't now! He seems like the type of person to escalate to violence",1380,0,1
"GM insists, no need to map x drive since server is in next room. She's currently looking for files in server room","First time writing post, trying to keep it short and understandable.  

Am self employed and have contract with a specific major hotel chain to fix, upgrade anything IT related in their hotels in my area. 

So, today was going to be a easy day, or so I thought. 
Quick HDD replacement in a hotel owned laptop for GM. Usually really fast job. Swapp HDD, connect to server, download and run few files. Max 1 hr (with issues). 

I get there, GM isnt the brightest as I notice within a few minutes. I introduce myself, explain why I'm there. She asks what I'm there, explain I need package IT department shipped, and laptop. She finally finds the laptop and directs me to do my job in the Lobby. Ok odd, but whatever. It will do for now. 
After swap, I need network. This is where the fin begins. Am trying to explain to her I need secure network, guest wifi doesnt cut it. I need to connect to the server to access some files. 
She doesn't get it. Says guest wifi works good on her phone, even for files. 
I give up, call IT department. 
I speak to let's call him Mark, explain she wont let me connect to internet to access server files. Mark asks to speak to GM. It's on speakerphone. 
Convo goes like this: 

Mark :This is Mark from Hotel IT, am I speaking to GM?

GM: yes, this is GM from Hotel xyz. 

Mark: GM, I need my tech to connect to your secure internet, she needs to map a drive to access some files on the server, tondownload programs, and that is not possible through guest wifi. 

GM: Mark, I dont think its nessecary for tech to connect to server for files. The server is right here, she can find those folders there. 

Mark: Deep breath, quiet barely holding it together voice.. ok Thank you GM. Tech, you can go home, your work is done here. But before you hang up, can I quick speak to GM? GMn I will call you in 5 minutes, in the meantime, can you go into the server room, and find folder x with files xyz. 

GM: feeling victorious. Yes Mark, I will go look for those folders for you. Thank you tech, thank you mark I will speak to you soon. 

I take my phone and leave. Am done. Mark calls me back, tells me hes gonna have some fun. He already forwarded the info on a ticket to tech support in India.  Its gonna be a few days.


Update: I know it's been a few days, sorry guys busy week because the hurricane that hit near us. 
Anyways, Mark gave me a call and gave me the follow up. 
Somehow this lady managed to piss tech support in India off. 
After a few calls between Tech support and GM's higher ups, it was determined to teach her a lesson. (Again). 
2 things will happen

1) So instead of them sending me to fix the issue (literally plug in to ethernet, add to domain, and download a few files) , they shipped her a box with label to send the laptop in to have this done. 
This will take a while to get done and shipped back to her. 
2)She is send for training and no more from home access to her work. 

Having been a GM myself for 5 years befor I switched fields, I have a feeling this was not her first fuck up and she probably got a demotion. 
Also, I should have added this in the first post to make it more redditty.  Sorry if spelling is off. And tri-lingual and english is my 2nd. Am also on the phone writing this.",1275,0,1
New to You Ink cartridge,"I love my mother but she is not computer (or phone) savvy. I’m no tech whiz but I can usually fix what she manages to break. Usually the errors are caused by clicking everything potentially related repeatedly. This has lead to 20 Or more copies of a document being printed because she just kept clicking! 

Today, she texted me that the printer was broken. I video chatted with her so I could see what she was doing as her descriptions of icons are comical at best and often leave me scratching my head trying to figure out what she’s talking about.(For instance the Bluetooth icon is the sideways spaceship!)

I went through all the common printer error fixes. Had her check cords and power cycle. Even had her reset the print spooler. Nothing. She’s getting really frustrated And then blurts out that maybe Jan (her friend) gave her a faulty ink cartridge. 

Turns out Jan was upgrading her printer and asked my mom if she wanted any ink. My mom said yes and somehow managed to jam Jan’s ink cartridge into the printer. They were not the same cartridge number (or brand) and she had to “really push” to make it fit. 

One emergency trip to Staples and shockingly the printer prints! And I’ve learned not to underestimate my Moms ingenuity!",247,0,1
But...your PC doesn't have an optical drive....,"This story takes place exactly 20 years ago, give or take a few days.  (Mid-Summer of '00.)  I was working for a medical center at the time, and while we had a centralized IT department, satellite locations would have an embedded IT guy on site so that they didn't have to keep sending someone down from the main building for routine issues.  Since I was the ranking FNG, I was the guy assigned to our financial services office...home of the least tech-savvy folks in the entire organization, and thus some of the more frustrating issues.  This was a transitional period for us, as we were going from a 100% analog paper-and-bankers-boxes archive to a digital CD-based one.  Older records were still on paper, but newer ones were systematically being scanned in and shredded.  So if someone had to retrieve a record from within the past year-ish, we had a dedicated PC for that purpose.  You'd search the database on the archive PC and it would tell you which CD to look for, and what the file name was.  You'd then go find the CD, pop it in the drive, grab the file, and return the CD to the rack.  Not too difficult, and most people learned how it works without too much hand-holding.

Well I got a call one day from a lady who complained that the PC was eating her CD's.  I asked her if she could elaborate on that, and she said ""Every time I put a CD in the computer, it doesn't work.  I've put 3 or 4 CD's in already and none of them work.""  I asked what she meant by eating, and she said ""None of the CD's ever came back out.""

The hell?  OK so now I'm confused, because it suddenly hits me...I've been at my desk all day.  The archive PC is in a little nook off to my left, in plain sight...and no one has been there all day.  I ask her when this happened, and she says ""Just a few minutes ago!""  I explain to her that the archive PC is back by me, and no one has been there all day.   And she replies ""Oh no, I didn't want to sit back there in the corner, so I took the CD's back to my desk.""

Excuse me?  Sorry but none of the PC's in this office are equipped with optical drives.  The only PC with an optical drive is the dedicated archive PC, back by me.  ""Well you must be mistaken because mine does.""  At this point I'm definitely picking up some Dunning-Kruger vibes, so I tell her to sit tight while I come over to see what she's doing.  I reach her desk, ask her to demonstrate the issue...which she does by shoving a CD between the drive bay covers on the front of her PC.  I heard the disc clatter to the bottom of the chassis, and it was all I could to not to rip out my hair right then and there.  I ended up taking her PC back with me, opening it up, and fishing the CD's out.  Half of them needed to be resurfaced thanks to her carelessness.  I got her PC all put back together, got her workstation set back up, and explained to her that she needs to use the archive PC.  I explicitly stated that her PC does not have a CD-ROM drive, and that the gap she was shoving the discs into was just a gap.  There was nothing in there.

I get a call about 30 minutes later from her.  ""Whatever you did, it didn't fix the problem.  My PC is still eating the CD's.""

So once again I retrieve her PC, open it up, dig the discs out, and put in a call to maintenance.  I had a guy come over with a tube of silicone putty, which I used to physically seal the gap between the drive bay covers.  I kept the PC back with me for an extra hour to let the putty cure, while I resurfaced the discs while contemplating how much whisky I was going to need at the end of the day, then set her workstation back up AGAIN.  I tried my best to explain to her using very small words how her PC can't use CD's, and even if it could, she doesn't have the database that tells her which records are on what CD. I reiterate that she *must* use the dedicated archive PC because it's the only one with a CD drive, and the only one with the database.  She nods in apparent understanding.

10 minutes later, ""Something is still wrong with my PC, I can't get the CD's in the drive anymore.""

At this point I told her that I was going to get back to her on the issue and terminated the call.  I sent the write-up of all three calls to her supervisor, along with an email that basically said ""Tech support is my job, making sure your employees can do their jobs is yours.  Fix this.""  (Of course worded a lot more politely and tactfully--this is just the short version.)  Apparently her ineptitude extended to many other areas and damaging the archive CD's was the straw that broke the camel's back, because she was no longer employed the following day.",1146,0,1
My grandmother made my mom drive two hours to plug in a cable 😂,"My grandparents are my favorite people. They have always helped me and loved me. But they have not entered the 21. Century yet.

A few years ago my grandmother called my mom who is good with tech stuff, because she couldn't get the printer to work. My mom sat patiently and tried helping her for an hour before realizing that she couldn't help over the phone because my grandmother was afraid of touching any buttons. So that weekend we drove the two hour drive to my grandparents to visit and fix the printer. My mom went in to their office, plugged the printercable in the wall and suddenly it printet like 20 of the same recipe that my grandmother wanted to cook. 

Another time at Christmas I gave my grandmother a cheap smartphone and she really loved it, but she always did something wrong and messed it up. I don't know how because I told her exactly which buttons she should touch and which she should avoid. Anyway, she called and said that she couldn't log in. I asked if she had tried too many times, and she didn't know. I asked if it said PUK-code, and she didn't know. After a while she realized that yes it was in fact asking for a PUK-code. I told her to find her calender because I had written all the passwords down for her. I asked her to find the Puk-code and she couldn't, so after a while she gave up. She decided to drive the 30 minutes to my apartment (I had moved closer to her) so that I could take a look. I opened her calender, found the password page where I had written the Puk-code with big letters and I unlocked her phone. 

She once got almost mad at me because I told her that she had to find her email address and password to log into Facebook from my computer. She said that her computer always just logged right in by itself. I said that mine does too but with my account and not hers. 

She is the sweetest old lady and I love her so much, but sometimes I really have to take a deep breath 😂😂",1538,0,1
"You realize remote appointments are for people who are REMOTE, right?","This happened years ago, long before COVID-19, so the situation is obviously *very* different now. 

I used to work in my university's Writing Center. For those of you who are unfamiliar, it's a place where students can go to get a second pair of eyes on whatever document they were working on. We helped with grammar, content, research... basically everything short of editing the paper for you. 

I was a tutor, but I often found myself in an unofficial tech support role. Many of our students were adults returning to college after a decade or two in the workforce, and were unfamiliar with tools like Microsoft Office or Canvas, so I was often called in during gaps in my schedule to help out. 

One service we offered was online consultations. These were the *bane* of our existence, for multiple reasons. First, we were limited to university computers that would reset to a default image every evening. Our official tech division kept things like Chrome and Office updated on the main image, but Skype was something exclusive to the tutoring department. As such, whenever we found ourselves with an online appointment, we had to *reinstall Skype.* As students could make online appointments *seconds* before the appointment window, there were multiple occasions where a furious student would call the front desk asking where we were as we frantically tried to update our client. We switched to Hangouts eventually, though I don't know what they're doing now since I've left.

Next, once the connection was made, there was always some manner of technical issue. Online appointments were intended for students who either lived off campus, had work or family schedules that limited their ability to come in person, or who were sick (we were a high contact location, and I went through so much hand sanitizer. Glad I graduated before COVID). This meant that our online clients were older students with children, often in our nursing program. I *loved* my clients, but 70% of them did not understand how a microphone worked. They'd often hook up their Apple Earbuds (this was pre-EarPods) and try and talk into that tiny microphone on the wire... without setting the correct input first. We had to devote an extra 30 minutes to these first time online sessions just for troubleshooting.

Then there was the matter of actually opening the document, since we didn't have any remote desktop software. Our best solution was to get the student to upload their document to Google, after which I'd activate collaboration mode and start annotating. Many students have never used Google Drive, so I ended up awkwardly screen sharing more than once. One student even *copy and pasted their entire essay into the chat.*

Needless to say, this wasn't super popular among us tutors. Still, we understood why we had it, and did our best... but there was always a problem client. One Sunday, I had a coworker come to me with grim tidings. She looked like she was about to tell me my dog died or something. No... I had been assigned *that* client. She was a freshman, straight out of high school, and definitely a Karen in Training. She had gone through nearly *every tutor we had,* rejecting them after they failed to meet her needs, before moving on to the next. She also operated exclusively online, and *could not* grasp our online appointment system. Often, she'd get short with people for even trying to explain.

I stared blankly at my screen for a moment, before nodding and setting up my station. I wasn't going to let this woman get the best of me. 

I put on my best customer service voice, logged into Hangouts, and smiled. ""Hello, welcome to the Writing Center. I'm OP. How can I help you?""

All of those issues I mentioned above? The trouble with voice? Getting Google Drive to Work? We had all of them. She even had the earbuds of shame. But I am, if anything, a master of self-depreciation. I knew she would get angry if I blamed anything on *her*. Fortunately, my Customer Service game is really strong, so she was pleased with my efforts... though she did frequently mention how ""none of those other tutors could help me.""

 I didn't want to blame my fellow tutors for her problems. For one, I knew full well they were *her* fault, and two... they were my friends! Comrades! So, after spending 20 minutes working through her tech issues, I decided to use one of my old scapegoats... university internet.

""Sorry about all the trouble,"" I said. ""The internet on campus has been acting up lately.""

""Oh, tell me about it."" she said. ""The internet has been slow in my dorm all day!""

...I paused.

""Your... dorm? You live on campus?"" I asked.

""Yeah.""

""Why do you go through all of this online stuff then?""

""Oh, I'm just lazy, lol.""

...All year, this woman had been putting my fellow clients through hell with her technical issues. Her inability to operate the basic tools. Her short and rude nature with my fellow clients. I had only avoided her legendary wrath by pretending to be a doormat and quietly submitting to her demands. Only to find that all of this could have been avoided if she had decided to *walk the 200 yards from her dorm to the writing center?*

Seriously, the Freshmen dorms were *next door*. In fact, on certain days, we had a writing center *inside the freshmen dorms*. I know because *I worked there.* I wanted to scream. I wanted to run to this woman's dorm and strangle her with her stupid earbuds. 

But I didn't. I just smiled, and said. ""Oh, well... online appointments are really for students living off campus. You'll have a better experience if you come into the center. Plus, we can offer you more detailed tutoring in person.""

I think I said some other things to butter her up. I can't remember. Eventually, she caved and agreed to come in person next time. When the call ended, I dropped my headphones, walked into the break room, and stared at the wall for my entire break.

I really don't want to know what the people working there *now* have to deal with.

tl;dr: Client using remote appointment system would harass fellow tutors for being unable to solve her tech issues. Turned out to live less than a minute away from our tutoring center.",335,0,1

"Oh boy, that pesky password change...","I don't work in tech support, but any time something doesn't go according to plan for members of my family, I'm the guy to call.

I have quite a lot of stories, but this one is the most recent and by far the funniest. Even more so, coming from my 35yo girlfriend and not the usual suspect - my 70yo aunt.

&amp;nbsp;

To give you some background - at one time we both worked for large company which uses an open source app to store passwords. It's a piece of software that allows you to save your login details for specific sites, other apps, etc in a **local** encrypted ""database"". When you then browse a site for which you have a password set up you can just press a key combination and it will populate your user name, password and log you in. So there no chance of typos, you don't have to remember the passwords and google doesn't have them either.
We kinda liked it so we each use it at home as well.

I should also preface this by saying that my girlfriend gets quite nervous when it comes to handling finance over the internet and there's even a slight deviation from what she's used to.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, to the story...

&amp;nbsp;

Some time back google started informing users about potentially pwnd passwords. I received a bunch of notifications, my gf only a few. Back before the password app days she was in the habit of reusing passwords so I told her to change them, just so we're sure. Or at least the most important ones - the main email address and internet banking. She hesitantly agreed. She took out her laptop and lied down in bed, which is directly behind my pc setup (directly behind my back, I can't see her). I put on my headphones and continued coding and listening to a podcast.

&amp;nbsp;

After 15 minutes I hear a loud scream! Shocked, I throw down my headphones while simultaneously jerking around to see what was wrong. My gf was freaking out: ""OMG, what the hell?!! I can't log in to the bank. Omg, I don't even remember the code to reset my password over the phone. I'm screwed, I'm TOTALLY screwed.........."".

&amp;nbsp;

'Well, that's bad...', I thought. 'If her internet banking got compromised, sorting it out with the bank is going to be the most annoying thing ever...'. I managed to hide my slight nervousness and started asking questions...

&amp;nbsp;

Me: It's fine, we're gonna figure this out. Was the banking password in the pwnd list google gave you?

GF: No, it wasn't, but but but... I can't login, we're screwed... *angry sad scared face*

Me: Ok, what were you doing? Did you just go to your bank's page, tried to login with the password app and got an 'incorrect password' error message?

GF: YES!!!

(Well, she was using the app, so not a typo then...)

Me: When was the last time you were able to log in?

GF: Yesterday!!!

Me: Alright, we might have to call the bank, then. At least to see what's going on. Let me google the number...

(Well, that's not good... But since I know how stressed she can get, let me check again, just for my peace of mind...)

Me: Ok gf, breath in and out, in and out. Now, please, explain **EXACTLY** what you were doing. Step by step, click by click.

GF: Well, I changed my password and now I can't log in...

Me: That's fine, so just to restate what happened - you opened chrome, went to your bank's page, logged in, clicked 'change password', put it a new password, clicked 'save', clicked 'logout' and now you can't log back in using the new password?

(GF: a brief blank stare)

GF: ...no?

Me: Wait, what do you mean no?

GF: I didn't do it like that...

Me: Well, how did you do it then?

GF: Well, I opened the password app...

GF: edited the bank entry with a new password...

GF: pressed save... and now I can't log in..?

(Me: a brief blank stare)

&amp;nbsp;

I almost wet myself from how hard I laughed!

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR: My girlfriend changed her bank password in her **local** database and was surprised that didn't automatically change the password with the bank itself. Think of it as saving a new password in a notepad and being surprised that the bank doesn't know about it.",180,0,1
I want to save money but I dont want ink tank printer.,"Not so exciting story, but a very recent one. One of my clients wants to save as much money as possible when printing. Their printer just broke beyond repair point and they need a new one.

I spoke with the person in charge, they want a printer that has really cheap printing and toner/ink lasts at least 3500 pages. The best option for them is of course ink tank printer (they print about 3000 pages a month), so I recommended a few for them to choose from.

Their exact words were: ""I want to print as cheap as I can per page, I will let you recommend best option"", so I did.

Today, after waiting about 10 days they replied with: ""I don't want ink printer, I want laser printer, it is much cheaper to print with it"".

Of course, I did call them back right away to explain the difference between ink printers and ink tank printers, but the lady did not listen. She said ""My son is an IT student and he said, ink printers are expensive to print""

Now she has got in email inbox offer for laser printers. As you know, they are much more expensive to print, as higher maintenance costs, there is nothing else I can do for them. I wanted to save money for them, but I can see it is like mission impossible.

The student of IT has probably much more experiences as admin from IT company after many years in the job.

&amp;#x200B;

**Edit to avoid confusion:** ink printer and ink-tank printer are two different kinds of printers, both are inkjet, but in the ink-tank printer, you don't change cartridges, you just refill with ink (70ml-5000 pages for about 6€) and thats it. ",376,0,1

"""Out of spec""","Today, I have a tale from a very analogue world for you.    
My roommate was the hero here, and he's a watchmaker.    
And a proud one at that.    
He has worked at different stores and in different countries, always putting his nose into fine mechanisms that cost as much as a car and get their operation smoothed by surfaces out of ruby and similar witchcraft.    
His expertise means he mostly works with HIGH-END products.  

So, on a Thursday, he finishes the cleaning and calibration of one such wonders.  
Just a regular checkup, cleaning, demagnitizing adjustment, checking for precision...  
The fancy watch, one that winds itself thanks to an internal pendulum moved by walking, was just about as perfect as it could be, and as such, was given back to its owner.     


Monday comes around and said owner is back, and he's PISSED.  
His fancy watch stopped working!    
So again it's laid out in front of my roommate, who has a terrible feeling, as se second-hand is visibly out of place, just held in by the glass.    
From inside the casing, he hears a curious plinking, that certainly shouldn't be there.    
He opens the back and it's carnage.     
The hefty pendulum that winds the watch while you walk? It's been ripped loose. Not just a loose screw, the arm it hung from had been broken.    
You may imagine what the biggest and heaviest piece of such a mechanism does to the rest once it can move freely.

I and $supervisor from the previous story were in the tech shop, shooting the breeze and relaxing between calls, when the radio earpiece crackled up with the sweet sound of... background noise. I'm pretty sure I heard a voice in there somewhere, before the channel went dead. It definitely wasn't an accidental key, since the assault on my ear lasted a solid ten seconds.

&gt; **$me:** ""Repeat that? All we got was background noise.""

The radio crackled back to life, and the quality of it wasn't much better, but at least they were talking *in the vicinity* of their microphone this time - it was enough for me to hear the location ""1-Foxtrot-2301"".

&gt; **$me:** ""You said 1-Fox-2301?""

&gt; **$radio with excessive background noise:** ""10-4.""

I stand up and stretch my legs a moment, and $supervisor and I walk out to the machine that bore the location plate reading *1-FF-2301*. That one was a game we'd recently converted into a 3-pack of linked games that ""shared"" a bonus, which linked all 3 upper screens together. Of note is that the ""shared bonus"" was on a timer as a sort of attract mode, rather than triggered via gameplay - it would appear at certain intervals, and players would have to get a certain combination on the payline to play this bonus mode. After a period of time elapsed in the shared bonus mode, the game would return to normal play, to repeat again a few minutes later.

This was my first shift back after the games had been converted, so I hadn't had the time to read the game rules before then. (Still haven't, actually.)

The attendant - Rebecca, one of the ones that would actually try to troubleshoot some issues before calling us - was there when we arrived. She explained the issue to me and $supervisor: The patron wasn't seeing the win tally at the end of the shared bonus, when the timer reached zero and returned to normal play. Rebecca had tried explaining that it wasn't like a free-games bonus where the win was tallied at the end, but the patron wouldn't accept the answer. Rebecca then checked that we didn't need her, and excused herself to handle other calls.

So, we watch the game. Soon enough, it goes into the shared bonus mode, and almost immediately I notice that it's a ""game within a game"" bonus, where the paytable is changed but wagering is still required to play (compared to a free games bonus, where the paytable is usually the same, but a wager is not required). And as the patron is playing, she's mashing the spin button like it was the ""fire"" button on a Galaga coin-op. Eventually, she gets awarded a ""trip"" to the shared bonus on the upper screens, and wins... a good chunk of money, actually.

And then we see the issue: as it was tallying at the end of the ""trip"", she began playing Galaga again with the spin button, skipping the tally animation on the upper screen.

Eventually, the timer ends, the game exits the shared bonus mode, and the patron is upset that the win didn't show up on the upper screen.

&gt; **$patron:** ""See? It didn't show the 'big win' with the little numbers!""

&gt; **$me:** ""It showed, you just skipped it. When you press the spin button, it'll skip the little numbers.""

&gt; **$patron:** ""But I didn't! It didn't show when the timer hit zero!""

&gt; **$me:** ""You weren't in the bonus when the timer hit zero. It tried to play right after you went in the bonus, but you pressed 'spin' and skipped it.""

&gt; **$patron:** ""Are you sure?""

&gt; **$me:** ""Yes, ma'am. We can wait for another bonus and show you, if you want.""

The patron nods, and eventually the five or so minutes passes before the shared bonus mode triggers again. A couple of spins into it, the patron gets another trip to the bonus. The bonus plays out, and I see her reach for the spin button.

&gt; **$me: ""Ma'am, no, wait. Don't press the button yet.""

The patron looks at me confused, and I gesture towards the screen, which reads ""BIG WIN"" with the numbers quickly counting up to a number I'd normally expect to see on my check stub. After a couple of seconds, the patron gives the 'Ohhhhhhh' of Understanding and thanks us.

It's BROKE!,"This one comes from the Bio-Medical Engineer at the hospital I work at. I'm sure all of you IT guys can relate.

The hospital has a maintenance department (for facilities and grounds and catch-all), and an IT department (for computers and networking), and a BioMed specialist (for FDA-regulated equipment that is used directly in the care of patients). He was always bitching about how nobody would use the ticketing system or even give him any useful information, and how maintenance and IT were constantly punting him extra work by claiming things are a BioMed issue when they clearly aren't. I like to fondly imagine his job eventually drove him to eat a gun, but in reality he just got fired for his bad attitude.

He comes in one morning to find a random vacuum cleaner on his desk. No note. Housekeeper just plopped it on his desk. He was apparently bored, so he replaced the frayed wire that was preventing the power switch from turning on the unit, rather than trying to argue with maintenance about whose job it actually is. 

At least one person (he never figured out who because they never signed their notes) would send IV pumps and other things down to his department, without the required BioMed Repair form being filled out, with a handwritten note taped to it with the cryptic all-caps Sharpie message ""IT'S BROKE!"" Then an unnecessarily lengthy troubleshooting process had to begin to even figure out what problem might need fixing (if any).

To try to cheer him up, I once sent him a BioMed request and even properly used the ticketing system, informing him ""It's BROKE!"" ...But he closed the ticket without comment.",665,0,1
Shortcut Short Comings,"There is a real problem where I work with most users relying too much on shortcuts. They have shortcuts to servers and websites scattered all over their desktops. The first problem is that some don't even know how to make a shortcut (so IT has to make them for the users). But some are just totally lost without them.

Today I got a guy walking in my office (no helpdesk ticket and no phone call) saying that he cannot get to the timeclock website, but others can. I pull up the timeclock website and it is working for me as well. He goes back to his desk and I remote his machine (Social distancing and all) while he is on the phone with me. I open Chrome and type in the timeclock website into the address bar of the browser. It immediately goes to the proper timeclock website (which is basically only the domain name of the company - not referencing any id or script in the link or anything) and everything works perfectly. I tell him it appears to be working and he thanks me.

Five minutes later he calls back saying his old shortcut was broken and he made a new one (like this was a dramatic feat). The new one is working perfectly now.

Now the address is JUST the name of the company (for example [abctimeclock.com](https://abctimeclock#3.com)) so not sure how he could mess that up. (There is nothing extra, no reference to a script, ID number, hidden directory or app.) But the biggest problem here is that while he knows how to make a shortcut, he did not know how to type the domain name in the address bar to manually go to the website and had to rely solely on a shortcut to get him to a website he uses 4 times a day.",565,0,1
It runs on what?,"Just happened today. The school district I work for has been handing out wifi hotspots to families without internet so the kids can use it for distance learning. Yeah it costs a fortune but it needs to be done especially in some of our poorer neighborhoods. We handed one out to a family and it worked great the first day. Second day it didn't work at all, so they brought it back.   
The Principal couldn't get it to work so he tracked me down and asked how to get it running.

I look at it and I don't see and green blinky lights. Always a bad sign. Then I see the box he's holding. Its the box the hotspot came in and it has all the device and cell vendor info on it. But thats not what interested me. I take the box from him. remove the cardboard insert. Unwrap from their original factory sealed wrappers the power block and power cord.

Plug it in to the wall and into the hotspot. The battery light blinks a bit then goes solid. A few seconds later the unit comes to life spewing out moderately secure wifi goodness.

I need this done before the board meeting in 10 min,"Background, I work at a MSP and one of our clients is a mid-sized manufacturing client. The boss of this client is someone who we will call ""Senile boss"" (SB) because he forgets things over and over and not just technical things. SB is known to call in and demand all sorts of things that are outside of our contract. Normally this isn't too bad, more helping him along as he appears to not understand how computers work and that's why we are there. So this happened several years ago when I supported this client directly. I get a call:  


Me: Thank you for calling \[MSP\], how can I assist you?  
SB: Yeah, i need some assistance on this excel sheet I have to present to the board in 10 minutes.  
Me: OK let me get connected and you can show me whats going on

I get connected and find that this is a giant excel document with sheet upon sheet that reach references something else in a different sheet of the document. It is very well put together and shows a lot of P/L on raw materials and time. 

Me: Ok, I see the sheet here. What is the issue?  
SB:Yes, you see on the sheet marked ""lines"", I want to add another ""line"" so I can project the P/L of adding another assembly line. Do I just copy/paste the other ones?  
Me:Well no, you can do that but the cells will still reference the old locations, you will need to go though and reference the correct location in the previous line's location.   
SB:Can't you do this? I need this done before the board meeting!  
Me: Sorry but that is outside our purview and even if we did that as a courtesy it would probably take us more than 10 minutes.

"The mystery of the ""moving black dot"" on user's screen","Hello fellow IT guys! First time here!
Not a native English speaker so please forgive me if I made some mistakes. 

So here's a story of mine:

A few years ago I was located on-site with an other IT guy, supporting 300+ users at a large company. 
I was already in tech support for a couple of years prior and had seen a lot of things, so I thought there was nothing much that could surprise me.  

Spoilers: I was wrong. 

One day we get a call to the IT office and I answer.
The user calling was a 50+ quite nice lady. She usually had valid issues and was quite reasonable so I wasn't expecting anything extreme. 

The conversation went as follows:

.......... 

Me: Hello, it's $me from IT. How may I help?

User: A black dot is moving around on my screen and I can't make it go away! 

(I was already dumbfounded at this point as I suddenly couldn't think of anything that could cause this problem.)

Me: Uh, what do you mean by ""a black dot""? Is it doing anything specifically? Does it move around in a patten? 

User: No. It is just moving randomly around, it doesn't even react to any cursor movements or clicks. 

Me: Are you sure it's not related to anything else? Did you try closing every other program? 

(I assumed it was a buggy loading screen from some software they used at the company.)

User: Yes, I've closed everything but it's still there and moving around. 

Me: Alright, I will head over to your desk and see if we can fix it. 

............... 

I went to her desk and sit next to her. Had to see this in person. 

And she was right. It was a 1-3 pixels sized black dot-thing moving around in random patterns on the screen.

* I tried clicking on it, checked the running processes on her computer. -&gt; The dot remains. 
* We rebooted the computer. -&gt; The dot remains 
* I checked if there were any viruses present or hidden somewhere. -&gt; The dot remains
* I reinstalled her graphic drivers. Moving dot still there. 
* Booted into safe mode. -&gt; The dot remains
* Booted up using an installer USB. -&gt; The moving dot is still there. 
* I replaced her DVI cable. -&gt; STILL there. 

The damn black dot got me. I was wondering if it was a faulty monitor but it was so surreal that I couldn't imagine that this was due to hardware failure. 

At this point 30 minutes passed and my colleague and a quarter of the office personnel gathered around to witness the mystery of the moving black dot. 
It was hilarious and this was on a Friday, so everyone was cool about it. 

We were all laughing but I was dying inside that I couldn't figure it out. Then something... Odd struck me about the dot. It was moving so... Organically? Biologically?

I put my eyeball literally to the screen glass and I could see that the mystery black dot had legs. It was not simply moving around but rather crawling.

It was an actual freakin' spider! A tiny-ass, pixel sized, newly hatched spider! It got somehow behind the screen glass and was moving around INSIDE the monitor. It was so unexpected that I just muttered: ""I figured it out..."" and stayed quiet for a couple of seconds. Everyone was giving the wide eyes and awaiting the explanation. 

I explained the situation and sure enough, within a minute the tiny spider got to the edge of the screen and managed to crawl out. By then It made me investigate for an hour and of course when I figured out its secret it decided it was time to leave. 
Everyone bursted out in laughter around me. Including myself. :) 
That was the most surprising/random case of my career. 

It's not a typical ""angry user vs IT guy"" story but this is something I'll probably never forget. :) was never expecting this. 

Moral of the story: 
If you work in IT and you think you saw it all. You didn't.",243,0,1
You Need To Run A Cable From A to B. But You Can't Get To A.,"Hi, this is my first post here:

The cast:

$Me

$VP - Vice President of a Department. Typical Manager of Managers guy. Repeat offender of the crime of not telling the IT Department what he needs from us until the last moment. 

$Tech - Technician under $VP that works in that building. 

Necessary information: The building VP is in charge of is under full reconstruction. They're building a building over the original building, so most of the area where I'm asked to run these cables is outside in the ""shop"" area that currently has no exterior walls, just the roof of the new building over it. Also, they're still running the machines out there. 



The morning started with an email from $VP to the IT Dept.

$VP: ""Hi, we need help moving this printer into the hallway""

I don't reply to him because he just runs all over the place all day long and won't see my reply for hours. Also, it's just a big printer serviced by an outside company, whom we love in IT. They also have another down there that isn't being moved, so I figure it's not a big deal. Also, I'm not a morning person and I like to just take care of easy stuff in the morning if I can as I sip my coffee. Printers are evil, and something always goes wrong with them. Hence, my lazy approach to this email. 

A few minutes later, $Tech calls me. 

$Tech: Hi, $VP needs this printer moved into the hallway because the room it's in is going to be worked on today. It needs hooked up in the hallway so we can continue to print. 

$Me: I'll be right down. 

I really do head right down (begrudgingly) after grabbing a 25ft ethernet cable, figuring I'll just plug it into a nearby jack and call it good, the printers' addresses are reserved in DHCP, so there should be no issues. 

I get down there, $Tech and I move the printer into a different hallway than I was originally thinking (the one I was thinking of would have made more sense, but I'm just a lowly IT guy). I try to use the cable I brought with in a nearby jack and $Tech stops me. 

$Tech: You can't do that. We need to run it through this hole in the wall so that the construction crew doesnt trip over it. 

I look up and see a hole they drilled in an exterior wall that has an extension cable running through it that they are using for their timeclock that they also moved into this cramped hallway without telling IT. Now, there's a huge new roof over this exterior wall, so I'm not too worried about this cable being there in case anybody was going to point out how ridiculous that is. 

$Me: Okay that's fine, I'll be right back with my push rods and some cable and we'll run a new cable for it. 

It's not really that big of a deal, it should only be a 30 foot run or so up over and down. The switch closet for this building is rather close by. In fact, it's in the same room as the printer was in. They don't really need this printer, as they have another one 30 feet away, but I'll oblige them because I really just want a peaceful morning without any confrontation. 

So I get back with my gear 15 minutes later and I go to run the cable. Then $VP sees me and walks me through the whole thing about about moving the printer because they're working om that room and how we need to run the cable, blah blah blah, heard it all from $Tech. Then he says something that catches my ear. 

$VP: They just started putting epoxy on the floor in there a few minutes ago, that's why we had to move it. 

$Me: So I can't actually go in there? It's off limits? 

$VP: Yep. We also need a cable ran to a desk outside that we took from that room so $Tech can submit [information I don't understand, but am pretty sure isn't a pressing matter based on what I've heard] until next week when we can move everybody's stuff back in. Also, the construction crew knocked one of your round thingies (Ubiquiti Access Points) off the wall and broke it, and we had to take the one on the other side down so it didn't happen to it too. We need you to run a new cable to put that one up in the middle. Also, the wifi out there has been really spotty for a while, are you guys messing with it? 

I didn't answer him for about 15 seconds probably. I did my best to have a look of deep calculation on my face while I tried to comprehend what he was telling me.
Finally... 

$Me: So I can't go in that room, and all the cables outside of the main area are gone or in use? 

$VP: Correct. 

$Me: Okay, I can't run cables then, our network equipment is in that room and I'll need to get in there to hook it all up. You're going to have to do without until this is done.

$VP: Okay, we can manage, but you need to fix whatever you did to the wifi. We have to have the wifi going because we're going to run the machines in a few days and we're going to have a client in [redacted] watch from a few cameras and laptops we'll have set up through a Teams meeting.

$Me: Is the wifi working inside the main building fine? 

$VP: Yes. 

$Me: Okay, so the reason the wifi is so terrible outside is because you took down one Access Point so it didn't get damaged - and thanks for doing that by the way - and because the other one is ruined. I'll need to get that Access Point up for you to have wifi out there. 

$VP: Okay, so could we just wire up everything physically instead of using wifi? 

$Me: With what cables? 

Now it's his turn to pause and think for a few seconds. I'm sure that he is realizing the impossibility of the task he's assigned to me. Then it dawns on him. 

$VP: You come in at six, right? 

$Me: Unfortunately, yes. 

$VP: Well, if you come in right away, I bet you can walk on the floors before they put on the next coat on tomorrow and you can get it done in time. They start at 8:00.

$Me: Okay. I will be here shortly after six tomorrow. Thanks. 

I prompty left. The cables were all ran the next morning. Printer, Desktop, and AP were hooked up just before 8:00 the next morning. I was personally hoping it wouldn't work out for some reason and he would have to suffer the consequences of not telling IT what they need to know in advance. I'm sure he didn't learn from this mistake, as I had to mediate between him and two other departments later in thr week because he didn't tell them what they needed to know. We'll call it a happy ending, because this is the best we can really hope for.",408,0,1

Teaching a developer to troubleshoot,"My company has an employee, ProblemChild (PC). PC was hired as a data analyst for the business fresh out of grad school in mid 2019. In late 2019, his department was cannibalized by the rest of the org and he ended up in IT. I started teaching him some SQL and he got put on a project creating some base views from a couple of ERPs then consolidating them into one, pretty basic stuff. He creates the scripts and works with my team (DBAs and integration developers) to create cache tables for some of the larger datasets or slower/less used ERPs. My team then deploys them to test and production. He has read-only access to test and production. In theory, each of his scripts should be reviewed by his boss and tested in test before moving to production. We haven't had any previous issues with this process. We deployed his first script to production in January and have deployed one or two a week on average since.

Today I get a call.

PC: Hey, one of my consolidated views, rt.ConsolidatedERPs, is not working in production but it works in dev.

Me: Oh yeah? What is wrong with it?

PC: The data is not consistent between dev and prod.

Me: Well, yeah, that's accurate. We don't refresh dev data daily..

PC: But it's missing all the data from two of the four systems in production.

Me: are the subviews that feed into this consolidated view working?

PC: Yes. (shares his screen) See? Here's the create view statement that unions the four subviews.

Me: Ok, but did you check each subview?

PC: Yes, they're all listed.

Me: Do they have data?

PC: I don't know, I don't have any control over production.

Me: You have read access to all this data in production. What happens when you query each subview?

PC: (runs the relevant portions of the create view statement to select each subquery in dev) All data is here.

Me: Now do the same in production.

PC: But I can't see the create view statement in production.

Me: I understand, but you can see it in dev. The production view is the same definition.

PC: But it works in dev.

Me: I understand. That's why we want to check in prod.

PC: It's broken in prod.

Me: I understand that the consolidated view is broken in prod. That's why we need to check the subviews. We have to find which one is broken.

PC: Oh.. ok. (doesn't sound like he really understands but tries to query the very slow rt.ERP1 in prod on screenshare)

Me: I don't think that's the right object. Is that the one you checked in dev? Is that the one that's in your create statement for the consolidated view?

PC: no, but it's the same thing.

Me: It's not the same thing. This is a different object. You need to check the same one you checked in dev.

PC: (after a little more back and forth, queries cache.ERP1) Oh, this field has the wrong value. None of this data will show in the consolidated view.

Me: I see that! We know that rt.ERP1 data populates this table, right? What feeds rt.ERP1?

PC: You mean in dev? bv.ERP1. But it's right, see? (queries bv.ERP1 in dev)

Me: Again, the definition in prod should be the same as in dev. Let's check bv.ERP1 in prod.

PC: (queries it) Oh this column has the wrong value hardcoded in. It should be the same as dev.

Me: We'll need to get that updated through our change management process.

It was pretty painless from there, but I was genuinely questioning my sanity and communication skills. He has never been confused about dev, test, and prod being three completely separate systems. I have never had a explain to an adult, much less a developer and data analyst, that you have to check inputs if you're not getting the expected output.",183,0,1
The Chairmen are a bunch of Chairchildren,"Hello! This time a story from my girlfriend who works as a system administrator (this is important) at a small insurance company. Her last day is on Monday. And this is a story about the Chairmen of said company.

A few days ago, one of the Chairmen walked up to her and asked for help with their conference call with a remote branch that's supposed to happen in 15 minutes. Doesn't really say what the problem is, but requests help. Being the good Samaritan she is, she agrees and arrives in the conference room 5 minutes before the call begins.

As it turns out, they wanted her to simply call into the virtual conference room. For those who don't know, it is basically the same as making a phone call. You pick a ""contact"" (virtual conference room) and you press the CALL button. After they saw that they joined the conference room, they basically brick-walled the sysadmin and ignored any attempts from her to explain how those calls work, let alone how to set them up properly with calendar invites and everything.

After that she went to complain to get colleagues and they explained the Chairmens behaviour to her. As it so happens, the people at the top of the food chain never made a single conference call on their own, because the person setting it up for them every single time was none other than the director of IT herself.

This is not the first expression of entitlement from the Chairmen either. One of them ORDERED a tester, a person who had nothing to do with it, to configure Outlook on the Chairmans phone. Then got super pissed and complained to the board that he was made to wait 10 minutes until the actual user support guy came back from lunch, even though the Chairman had made an appointment and made the user support wait an hour for him.

This is partially the reason my girlfriend has resigned from the company",202,0,1

Sometimes you just go the extra mile out of sympathy,"I took a call where there was a customer explaining that his internet was down and had been down for three weeks.
He would have a 100/100mbps connection and was a simple/regular user.
He calmly asked for an update regarding his errand.

I explained to his that his errand has gotten stuck and been transferred to a 3rd line group that handles systematic failures that makes orders get stuck.
His problem began when a worker sold him a 1gbps internet speed with an offer. The system disconnected his 100/100Mbps connection and started the 1Gbps connection. Only to get stuck because the system found that the customer needed a physical technician to go to his dedicated switch in the station and change his connection to a switch that could handle 1Gbps connections.
The technician had done his work but in turn, the customer needed a brand new fiber converter, as his old Orexis fth-3 could only handle 100Mbps.

The customer with this knowledge decided to cancel his order and go back to 100/100Mbps, which one of my colleagues helped him with. Note: The order never got status updated to delivered because the customer never got the 1Gbps.

There was an ongoing systematic change job from 100/100 to 1Gbps which is labeled as an execution job, which can not be canceled, it has to be finished before we attempt to change or remove it. Because my colleague tried to change it before the execution order was finnished, it got stuck and sent to our 3rd line that takes these orders manually. They had 8 weeks of backlogs due to another systematic order problem.

After i explained this to the customer he became distressed and almost started crying and told me that the mobile gsm network solution does not work because he does not have signal. He is in a wheelshair and only has his computer and TV going for him. For three weeks he had lived with incredibly bad gsm internet and tried to watch series on the lowest quality, buffered for hours. Sometimes he would get error on the website midway through buffer and he had to start over. Even loading basic sites for read took time. 

So i felt sympathy ofc.
I told him to hold on and started to lurc in the systems and see if i could do anything.
I looked at his connection in the operation system and thought that its likely possible to flat out remove the connection instead of letting it stay and be manually handled by the 3rd line colleagues.
So i said to the customer that i will try something and it might work, or might not work.

This is beyond the regular job a 1st line tech support does.
This is the realm of backoffice stuff.
However, because i've worked at this company for 7 years i have more experience than about 90% of the 1st line employees in all systems related to fiber connections.

I went into the system and pulled some strings in the dates and went into the manual add/remove page and managed to remove the 1Gbps profile. After that i just ran a regular connection job on a 100/100 and got it connected.

I went back to the customer after i saw the ip adress pop up and i saw the mac-adress from the router.
I said: Check your connection, try to use the internet from your router.
The customer became overjoyed and ive never gotten so much praise from one guy. It was humbling and almost embarrassing. He wanted to talk to my boss and he went and wrote a letter of appreciation. I didn't want him to do that because i thought i would get in trouble for overstepping my authority and service edge. But he insisted. 

The story ended well, i saved the customer from another 5 weeks of dial up quality internt and i didnt get a slap on the hands.

"Failed to overclock properly, refuses to pay for help","I work at a local computer store as a technician. I build and diagnose PC's for a living.  A customer came in today with her PC she bought from us saying that it is getting hot.  Fans ramp up to hell and the CPU goes to 99 degrees.  

I offered to look at it and I'd call her as soon as I knew the issue (we do not allow customers to stay for a longer period of time due to COVID restrictions within our company).  

After 2 minutes of taking the PC apart I noticed that EVERY! SINGLE! FAN! was clogged with dust, hair etc.  She has the PC for about 2 years. 

 I cleaned it for her and booted it up using one of our test drives to make sure the temps and FPS are okay and it worked just fine.  Booted it up with her HARDDRIVE and the temps and FPS are WAY worse than they should be for a machine with a i7 6700k and GTX 1080.  

I started looking at her installed software (all this with her permission) and I saw that she had Intel XTU and MSI Afterburner installed. I launched the applications and I noticed that they where set to the HIGHEST power targets that where stable on her system. 

She was using a INTEL STOCK COOLER!   I called her to tell her about what I found and she said that WE did all that to her PC and that it was like that when she bought it. This is not true because we do not pre-install and software except for Google Chrome and removing the bloat that Microsoft installs with Windows like Candy Crush Saga and all that bs. 

I told her this and she got mad, and I mean MAD! I offered to tweak the system to run at its best with the best overclock it could run since it looks like she tried to overclock herself. She agreed that she would pay 100 bucks for the entire work we had done to the system.  

We finish the work and call her to tell her that the system is ready for pickup.  She comes in and REFUSES to pay saying that ""there where only software tweaking done and that does not cost money"".

 I laughed at her thinking it was a joke and then she took her PC and started heading for the door.  I could not believe it, she ACTUALLY tried to get away without paying. I locked the door using our ""anti theft"" button where we can lock the doors by the press of a button since we got products out of the floor like laptops, graphics cards, monitors etc.  

She started yelling that she'd call the cops and I just said ""fine by me"".  She ended up coming to the desk, paying the 100 bucks.  

I unlocked the doors, gave her the receipt and wished her a good day.  She has not complained at all yet, but who knows, she might come back in a day or two...",318,0,1
The Zoom meeting audio mystery.,"Our sales department is doing all of their meetings remotely now due to the pandemic. I'd gotten one users laptop set up earlier in the week and they'd had no problems. Today a different user was going to be doing the same thing with their laptop. I'd set everything up an hour before their first meeting and asked the user to test everything to make sure it was all working. Shortly after their first meeting was scheduled to begin I got the call.

SP = Sales Person, Me = Me.


SP: *calls helpdesk* I was able to join the meeting but I can't hear anything and they can't hear me!


Me: Did this just start happening? Was it working when you tested it earlier?


SP: I never tested it before the meetings started.


Me: *groan* I'll be right there.


I proceed to the users office and find that their audio is set to output to their docking station instead of the laptops built in microphone and speakers. Just a click or two and the speakers come to life. The very thankful user begins the meeting and I start to walk out the door.


SP: WAIT! They still can't hear me!


Everything is set up properly but the microphone is barely registering anything. You have to practically yell to get the levels to move. I start checking everything I can think of while some client is on the screen repeating that they can't hear us.


SP: Do you think the microphone is just bad?


Me: I doubt it. This is a pretty new laptop and you've used it for meetings before.


SP: I have, but now that I think of it no one could hear me then either. They said it sounded like I was underwater. Then a few months later I tried to do some Skype meetings and they also couldn't hear me.


Me: ....Did you tell anyone? Did you call IT or open a ticket?


SP: No. We used someone elses laptop instead.


Me: *facepalm*



I can not understand for the life of me why they never let anyone know this laptop had a bad mic. They kept trying to use this laptop for video conferences for nearly 8 months when they knew the microphone didn't work. They never thought to let IT know about the issue until now. In the end I had to grab another users laptop and let her use it for the remainder of her meetings. I haven't had a chance to look at the bad laptop yet. I hope they get it to me before they try to use it for meetings again.",328,0,1
I can't close the alert,"This happened a few years ago. I was working as a trainer at a large global law firm, and we had just updated our phone system. Our mail room went to every desk and left a stickynote behind, explaining the basics of the change. We went from a 4 digit extension to a six digit extension, so it was important that the information was in front of them.

A user called the help desk because they couldn't get an alert to close. After some basic troubleshooting, the agent instructed the user to reboot. As it was rebooting, the user casually mentioned that the alert still wasn't going away. This caused some confusion. How does an alert stay on the screen when the machine is rebooting? So the agent asked the user to send them a picture. The picture he gets is of a stickynote placed on their monitor. The user wouldn't touch it because they were scared they'd break something.

That's the story of how I had to train a user how to remove a stickynote from their monitor.",355,0,1
"""My laptop is frozen!""","So this happened earlier this week. I work in the IT department at a smaller state college and with the increase in remote working we recently got in a new shipment of laptops to distribute to employees. Classes started back a couple of weeks ago with students on campus and our department is one of the very few that are now required to be here full-time with no remote working.

An employee submitted a ticket and then called immediately saying that her laptop was ""frozen and won't do anything"" and that she needed it fixed ASAP. She was very irritable but I dutifully walked her through some methods of trying to reboot her laptop including unplugging the power supply and removing the battery, but to no avail, and finally told her she would have to bring it in the following morning so we could take a look.

As she was getting it out of her bag I quickly noticed that the power supply was still wrapped in plastic. Yep, sure enough, she had never even plugged in the laptop. The battery was dead. After I pointed this out and told her she would have to plug it in and let it charge she demanded we give her a new laptop instead, which my supervisor agreed to simply to appease her, and began complaining about how the VPN also hadn't been working since we gave her the laptop... two weeks ago. Our employees have to use the VPN for the programs they use on a daily basis and I know that this is a full-time employee who should be working 40 hours a week, even if it's from home. 

Me - ""Wait... so you're saying you haven't done any work in the last two weeks?""

Her - ""Well the stupid VPN is MESSED UP!""

Me - ""Oh, we haven't had any other complaints... Did you submit a ticket or call anybody?""

Her - ""......""

Me - ""???""

Her - *grumble grumbl*e ""I don't have time for this, I've got to go.""

Database Support 18: Site Unseen,"Last time on Database Support: [Fork this, I'm outta here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/dmur9m/database_support_17_a_real_forking_pain)

---

Hello again, dear readers!  I'm not dead!  (Well, not on the outside, at least.)  It's been quite a while since my last post because my company got hit with ~~a hostile takeover~~ an acquisition last year, and just like [the last time that happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/6t33so/database_support_5_the_day_the_qa_died), that made writing about work more infuriating than cathartic for a while.

I'm back to writing stuff again, though I have no idea what my posting rate will be, and as always more trials and tribulations for me has meant more (eventual) tales in my backlog for you.

---

With this tale, we fast-forward back to my day job in database development, working on the utilities team.  My TLA internship was long behind me, but I couldn't escape government work entirely because we had a few federal agencies as clients, and in some ways working _with_ a three-letter agency was even worse than working _for_ a three-letter agency.

See, everything sucked when I was part of TLA, but I was at least allowed to deal with the suck directly.  With a federal agency as a client, even the smallest bug report comes with a tons of hoops to jump through.  Only certain employees can work on (or even look at) the bug report, log files and command output have to be heavily sanitized to the point that it's largely unhelpful for debugging, every time you ask someone on the client side for more details they treat you like you're a Soviet agent trying to torture them for state secrets, and so forth.

Generally this is just an added layer of aggravation on top of normal procedures and you can work around it somewhat, but there was one particular case I worked on that made the rest of them look transparent and straightforward.

Shortly after the debacle described in [a previous tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/a3yejh/database_support_15_taking_their_own_suite_time), an innocuous little bug report came in from $Agency regarding one of our network-related utilities.  It seems $utility was having some SSH-related issues, which wasn't surprising since you can configure SSH in all sorts of ways on your system and our customers have all sorts of crazy cluster and network setups, so some occasional issues are to be expected.  The ticket was incredibly sparse--it wasn't literally just ""This program broke, please fix,"" but it was fairly close--so we sent them the usual request for more information, put a corresponding task in our tracker for it, and waited for a reply

My team quickly received an email from an individual at $Agency, explaining that the issue had cropped up at a restricted site and our normal Field techs and Support agents were therefore not equipped and/or authorized to deal with it, so they were pointed in our direction by their usual Support contact and told we could help.  I was highly disinclined to bother with something that bypassed the normal escalation system, but CoolBoss told us that we should take a look anyway to keep $Agency happy and assured us that resulting delays in our existing tasks wouldn't be held against us, so RightHand and I went ahead and took a look.

As a refresher on nicknames from previous tales, RightHand was a good friend of mine and the second-most-experienced developer on the team after yours truly, and CoolBoss was, indeed, the coolest of bosses.  And as the email was very terse and formal-sounding with an undertone of ""I am a badass government agent, your argument is invalid,"" we'll call the kind and patient gentleman who wrote it ManInBlack.

The email back-and-forth that ensued over the next week or so went kinda like this:

&gt; **To: ManInBlack**  
&gt; **From: CoolBoss**  
&gt; **CC: DB_Dev, RightHand**  
&gt;   
&gt; I've copied DB_Dev and RightHand on this email.  Both of them are US citizens authorized to work on this case, and they're excellent troubleshooters.  If you've made any progress on the issue since filing $ticket, you can go ahead and add that to the ticket, as they both have access to our ticketing system.  

-

&gt; **To: DB_Dev, RightHand**  
&gt; **From: ManInBlack**  
&gt;   
&gt; I am not able to provide you with any further information about this issue.  This cluster is operating at a secure $Agency site, and all information about it is classified.  

Okay, sure, they don't want to just give us information that might cause them trouble if someone unsavory gets their hands on it (internal hostnames and such), totally understandable.  So I sent back a more specific request:

&gt; **To: ManInBlack**  
&gt; **From: DB_Dev, RightHand**  
&gt;   
&gt; We understand that you can't give us any classified information.  Could you check [basic stuff like ports and SSH configs] and let us know if anything doesn't match our documented recommendations?  

-

&gt; **To: DB_Dev, RightHand**  
&gt; **From: ManInBlack**  
&gt;   
&gt; We have already checked those configurations.  They match the recommendations.  

Makes sense, but always good to double-check that.

&gt; **To: ManInBlack**  
&gt; **From: DB_Dev, RightHand**  
&gt;   
&gt; Since those are all set correctly, could you try [basic troubleshooting steps]?  

-

&gt; **To: DB_Dev, RightHand**  
&gt; **From: ManInBlack**  
&gt;   
&gt; We've already tried everything.  It didn't work.  

Well that's helpful.

&gt; **To: ManInBlack**  
&gt; **From: DB_Dev, RightHand**  
&gt;   
&gt; All right, how about you try [more advanced troubleshooting steps].  

-

&gt; **To: DB_Dev, RightHand**  
&gt; **From: ManInBlack**  
&gt;   
&gt; We've already tried that too.  It didn't work either.  

Suuuper helpful.

&gt; **To: ManInBlack**  
&gt; **From: DB_Dev, RightHand**  
&gt;   
&gt; I found a fix to $utility that's going out in our next release and think it might be related to your issue.  
&gt;   
&gt; Can you try [series of steps] and see if that helps at all?  

-

&gt; **To: DB_Dev**  
&gt; **From: ManInBlack**  
&gt;   
&gt; Tried the steps your colleague suggested, still not working.  

Kinda rude to cut RightHand off the email thread because his idea didn't work _for reasons you refuse to tell us_, but okay.

&gt; **To: ManInBlack**  
&gt; **From: DB_Dev**  
&gt;   
&gt; If that didn't work either, we'll need some more information to diagnose possible causes.  
&gt;   
&gt; I've attached a modified version of $utility that includes more debugging code.  Could you run that and give us the output?  

-

&gt; **To: DB_Dev**  
&gt; **From: ManInBlack**  
&gt;   
&gt; We are not going to run untrusted code in a classified, secure $Agency environment.  

It's a scripting language, genius, the $utility source is right there, you can have someone on your end examine the changes for any funny business.  But fine, whatever.

&gt; **To: ManInBlack**  
&gt; **From: DB_Dev**  
&gt;   
&gt; If you don't want to run any modified code on the system, would it be possible for one of our Support engineers to access the system with supervision, either remotely or on site?  

-

&gt; **To: DB_Dev**  
&gt; **From: ManInBlack**  
&gt;   
&gt; No.  Again, this is a classified, secure $Agency site, and we have already determine that your personnel lack the proper clearance to access the system.  

Dammit, Jim, I'm a coder, not a miracle worker!  If you don't give me any information at all and don't let me help you, what exactly do you expect me to do?

&gt; **To: DB_Dev**  
&gt; **CC: CoolBoss**  
&gt; **From: ManInBlack**  
&gt;   
&gt; This issue has been open for over one week, violating our SLA, and the lack of progress is frustrating.  Please escalate this issue to the highest level of support if you are unable to help us.  

Okay, hold the goddamn phone.  Firstly, we were already doing ManInBlack a favor by looking into this at all after he bypassed the normal Support process, and there's no such thing as a SLA on favors.  Secondly, even if he were following the normal process, the customer doesn't get to decide how our escalation process works.

Thirdly, guess what, wise guy?  I'm the only one still at the company who'd worked on this utility before this issue cropped up and the only one besides RightHand who knew anything about its internals, and no one else is about to dive into its Lovecraftian abomination of code for you.  I _am_ the highest level of support.

&gt; **To: ManInBlack**  
&gt; **CC: CoolBoss**  
&gt; **From: DB_Dev**  
&gt;   
&gt; Unfortunately, I am unable to escalate your issue at this time, as the developer with the greatest expertise with $utility is unwilling to accept a further escalation without an up-to-date ticket.  Please update $ticket or file an additional ticket with our Support team, and it will be prioritized appropriately.  

I love the smell of passive-agressive technical correctness in the morning.

After that last email, there was radio silence on the issue for about two weeks.  No emails, no updates to $ticket, certainly no additional tickets.  Then:

&gt; **To: ManInBlack**  
&gt; **From: CoolBoss**  
&gt; **CC: DB_Dev, RightHand**  
&gt;   
&gt; Just checking in.  What's the status on the $utility issue?  Did any of the suggested fixes resolve it?  

-

&gt; **To: CoolBoss, Utilities Team**  
&gt; **From: ManInBlack**  
&gt;   
&gt; None of the provided fixes worked.  We were able to resolve the issue on our own.  

ಠ_ಠ

&gt; **To: ManInBlack**  
&gt; **From: DB_Dev**  
&gt; **CC: CoolBoss**  
&gt;   
&gt; I'm sorry to hear that we were unable to help.  We did the best we could with the information provided.  I've gone ahead and closed $ticket for you.  

To this day, that is the single most frustrating customer issue I've ever worked on.  There's really nothing worse than a customer who's useless and unhelpful at every turn and then blames you when things turn out badly.

"Why, oh why, is the printer not working? Could it be... because it’s not actually on?","I’m the youngest person in my office which means I am designated tech support. We’ve got a very fancy printer (too fancy IMO... it does way too much way too poorly, but hey, I’m not paying for it!) that my older colleagues assume I’m a wizard with. Basically, I am the one who puts paper in it and orders ink. Wizard, indeed. 

Today, older colleague #1 tries to print some things. It doesn’t work. I’m on the phone so she goes to older colleague #2, who also goes to mess with the printer. It still doesn’t work. They cluster next to my desk, and as soon as my call is done... 

“TanichcaF, you need to call the copier company right away! The printer isn’t responding at all! It’s just eaten the orders and nothing comes out! We need it running ASAP!” 

Dutiful receptionist that I am, I call he copier company. They say they’ll send out a tech tonight, and to go and turn off the machine until they get there so no more orders come through. I go to the printer room... 

And see that the printer has, in fact, been turned off this whole time. The touchscreen is black and “not responding” because nobody pressed the big ol’ power button this morning. I press the button. I tell coworker #1 to try again. And what do you know... NOW the printer works!!! Once again, I am lauded as the tech wizard of the office.

Fellow IT professional can't get his laptop to boot,"This is actually my husband's story.

So my husband worked for a warehouse where customers would mail in their laptops for hardware repairs. Users were required to fill out a form which documented what the issue was, although they usually didn't put enough info to actually diagnose the problem. In order to fix this problem, the warehouse had a call center, who would call the customer to get more info.


Husband gets this laptop and reads the paper form, which lists the problem as ""NO BOOT"", written in blue marker, and yes, in all caps. He pulls up the additional info provided by the call center, and finds out that the computer was sent in by an IT tech, who apparently opened up the laptop already to do some work, and then couldn't get the laptop to boot up when he was done with it.


Husband opens up the case and starts looking around, trying to find the cause. Does this laptop have two RAM slots, and the RAM got replaced into the wrong slot? Did the motherboard short out? It could be anything. But that's when he sees it. The CMOS battery was unplugged. What's worse is that the connector was sitting literally right next to the plug it belonged to. Husband plugs the battery in, computer boots up with no issues.


I don't know how much this warehouse charges to fix laptops, but the customer had to pay for shipping costs to mail the thing in from another state, plus whatever repair costs. All for an unplugged CMOS battery.


TL;DR IT tech mails in a laptop that won't boot. Had to pay shipping and repair costs for an unplugged CMOS battery.",1424,0,1
Groups aren't mailboxes,"I'll try not to bore all of you with a long back story but basically user was complaining that they could not open a mailbox and see the mail Within.

Me: okay what is the email address?

User provides email

Me: User, that is a distribution group, the mail goes to the distribution group and then is forwarded to whoever is a member of it.

User: but I was able to open it just a few days ago, you're wrong, I should be able to open it.

At this point I am fairly certain that the user doesn't know what they are talking about.

Me: okay, if you were going to send an email to that, Where would you send it?

User: completely different email than previously given

Me: that's the mailbox, you need to open it with that email address, not the other email address you were trying to use.

User: well when I open that mailbox it doesn't have all my mail that I'm expecting to see!

I collect the information and do a mail Trace.

Me: the mail is being sent to the mailbox, it looks like you have a couple of rules set up on the mailbox that are redirecting them to other folders but they aren't ever leaving the mailbox unless someone is forwarding them.

Phone forwarding isn't working,"Because of the plague people have been working from home more and more. For me, this involves forwarding people's office extensions to their cell phone during business hours. We had a complaint come in today about someone's extension not working. There's three people involved in this story. We'll call them Billy, Bob, and me. Billy and Bob are in the office together while I work from home. Billy is getting his office extension forwarded to his cell starting tomorrow and we are testing it. 

Billy: when Bob calls my cell from his office phone, it doesn't ring on my side and he says he gets sent to my voicemail. When he calls me from his cell phone it works just fine though. 

Me: If it's reaching your VM then it's out of our system at that point. Try to restart your phone and have Bob call you again from the office phone. 

Bob: (after power cycling Billy's phone) I'm still getting sent to VM and Billy says he doesn't see anything when I call. 

Me: you said your cellphone can reach him just fine right? Go to another co-workers desk and dail his extension from that phone. 

It works. But I hear a befuddled Billy in the background saying ""what are these weird numbers, I already blocked one"". 

Turns out that when you transfer an extension from the office to someone's cell phone, the number calling you only shows up as the office extension, not the whole phone number. So instead of getting a call from 1-XXX-XXXX, his caller ID said something like 1-(583). Billy assumed this was a spam number and was blocking them when they called.

Me: unblock the numbers Billy.",167,0,1

&amp;#x200B;

She's nice but not very tech savvy (obviously) so I try to explain best I could and as politely as possible

Me$: Yes because your wifi is down and you are on a public hotspot it's way too slow. I could barley connect to your machine I dropped off 4 or 5 times when just clicking a few buttons 

&amp;#x200B;

User$: is the public hotspot wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

Me$: Well it's the only thing you can currently connect to by the looks of it 

&amp;#x200B;

User$: but I have not changed anything so this must be what I have been on all the time

&amp;#x200B;

Me$: No it's just your WiFi isn't working so it has auto connected to this

User$: So I need to wait for (ISP Name) Engineer?

Computer not turning on.,"Short and sweet.

Got an email from my coworker who was working remotely due to covid to check out a users PC which was apparantly not turning on. He did all he could over the phone and I was in the building anyway.

I get there and see the tower is on. Great! So What was the issue? Monitor wasn't on.. 🙈

Bonus dumb encounter:

User reports monitor flickering. Check cable. May need replacement.

Get a call from my coworker to check out some ladies monitor for any issues. He stated he had her check the connections and it sounds like she may need a new cable.

I go there look at the monitor and have her show me the flickering. It flickers whenever she moves the monitor up and down. 
I look at the back, and sure enough, power cable is loose.
Push it in move it up and down rather roughly to test and tell her ""it should be fine now. Power cable was loose"".
She responds, ""But I checked everything and Bill said I probably need a new cable"".
I show her again it's not doing it.
Still rather upset that I'm not replacing the cable.. wtf. 
I don't want to deal with this shit, so I just replace the perfectly fine cable.

The day the server room cooked itself to well done,"Casting:  
$me - obviously  
$sa - on-call Sys Admin  
$eng - engineering dispatcher   

I had just started my night shift that particular night and felt the need to use the restroom. As I walked past our tech shop, I heard an unusual beeping. I opened the door and realized the beeping was coming from the backup temperature monitor for one of our server rooms. I work for a large casino and this particular room handles a good amount of the gaming floor. I get close enough to read the screen... 104.3 degrees (Fahrenheit). “No”, I think to myself, “it can’t be, our temperature alert hasn’t gone off!” Our main temperature monitor calls a list of phone numbers when certain thresholds are breached. I had no record of any such calls that day. 

Regardless, I head to the phone next to the server room door and then I feel it. The heat is RADIATING OFF THE DOOR. I grab the phone to call surveillance (they control the one of the door locks) and through the window into the server room I just see servers shut down. MY. HEART. STOPPED. I have never made so many calls in such quick succession. SURVEILLANCE OPEN THIS DOOR NOWWWWW” I don’t think they even asked why, I’m sure they saw what happened. 

Then I had to contact engineering to get a portable AC unit in. 

$eng: “Hello, Engineering speaking”  
$me: “I need someone to *server room* with a portable AC unit!”  
$eng: “well, what’s going on? There’s been no temperature alerts.”  
$me: “The server room just overheated to the point of failure and we lost 1/3 of our gaming floor. Are you coming or do I need to find and hook up the AC myself?”  
$eng: “uhhhh... we will be right there” 

And the crowning glory: contacting $sa.

$me: “hi $sa, I need you to come in.”  
$sa: “can it wait, I just climbed into bed.”  
$me: “afraid not, *server room* just went dark and we lost 1/3 of our gaming floor, you need to get here ASAP”  
$sa: “wut. Haha very funny seriously what’s going on?”  
$me: “I’m as serious as a heart attack. You should already be on your way.”  
$sa: “OMG ok I’m en route”  

Eventually it came to light that there had been temperature issues earlier that day, but instead of resetting the alarms, one of the engineering knuckleheads just set it to “silence”. Thus, no warning about the temps until it was too late. 

TL;DR: Idiot set server room temp monitoring service to “silent”, so nobody knew that the server room managing 1/3 of the casino gaming floor was cooking itself to death. I stumbled by just in time to watch all of the servers shut off.

EDIT 2: HOLY CRAP this was my first time posting anything. Thank you for all the comments and upvotes! Also (since this has come up a few times) yes there was data loss and hardware failure. We had a well maintained backup system so we only lost about 2 hours of data if I remember correctly. Hardware loss was expensive and took about 2 months to get everything fully functional.

"Setting up Workstations should be a breeze, until you realise the power isn't on!","Long time lurker, and first time posting anything on Reddit. For the first post, sorry, its a long one. I've tried to get it right... This happened to me several years ago... 2015 i think, so some of the wording changed but most of it is as it happened.

Cast

IT - Stressed out IT / Draughting Technician

OC - Older Colleague who had trouble with technology....

Me / I : you get it.

In my last Job, we had just moved the Geotechnical Team section from side of the building into another companies office space, as my company and theirs had merged. Great fun! This happened almost every year since i started at the company, as we were one of the smallest teams in the office.

Our workstations consist of a laptop, another stand alone screen with internet work phones all connected to each other. we had to setup our desks to allow us flexibility working.

OC had setup his workstation and like the rest of us had been told that we should be able to access the server via various ports nearby and be able to start working straight away. However the company has a rule that no two users are allowed to share the same Main power supply plug to prevent a short swapping out more than one users work.

All going well, we had setup the laptops, power supplies, desks and internet phones and I decided to setup another colleague's workstation as he had gone overseas for a holiday. We had to always do it ourselves, as the company figured a bunch of engineers should be able to sort themselves out...

IT, who was also one of the other technical draughting staff, was busy sorting out the ports and making sure that everyone could link into the server. He built the server, managed it and dealing with the almost daily server shutdowns at the time, as the company couldn't understand why the server needed to be expanded to deal with the extra traffic being patched into a 7 year old server designed for only 50 users not the 150 users in three separate locations that was currently it was dealing with at the time.

He was also instrumental in fixing everyone's computers, he even fixed my own personal one for a bottle of whiskey.

OC: IT, i can't get my screen to turn on!

IT: Make sure it's plugged in and you have actually connected it to the computer.

OC: I have, I can get my laptop to turn on but no power to the screen.

IT: Me, can you check OC's computer, knowing him there is a loose connection somewhere?

Me: Ok, i've setup another colleague's computer and his screen, and checked that its picking up the server, and running correctly.

IT: Cheers!

So i quickly take out and re-do all the connections, as OC couldn't get the screens to work, maybe there is a loose connection somewhere. It was known that his lack of computer skills meant that you were constantly, and being significantly older than most of us (in his 60's) meant that you might have to teach him several times for him to finally get it... though ask him to build something, and it would be painted and finished within a week.

After re-connecting everything and fixing a few errors. Me: Strange, it's not a connection issue, everything looks good, and the main power switch is on... IT, maybe we need to swap out his screens?

IT: Seriously, they were working less than half an hour ago!

Me: I will get my computer running and you can sort it out once you have time!

OC: but i need to get the Report out for the Company Management Meeting!

Me: Use the Laptop screen, the boss isn't going to mind waiting while we sort out the issue.

While IT is now trying to short out OC's screen sorted, I start up my computer and suddenly, i can't get my screen to turn on as well.....

Me: your not going to like this IT, but i can't get my screen to turn on as well!

IT: .... What! i don't have two spare screens. what's going here!

Now this is where we have 3 guys attempting to sort out a power issue on laptop computer where one screen isn't working, most of the time, it would be an easy fix, but as we have effectively moved offices and IT had planned on going away for the long weekend, he didn't want to resolve 10 different computer issues plus dealing with the daily server shutdowns, and was hoping place a request for an upgraded server.

IT: maybe we do need some more screens, Me can you work with no screen for a few days,

Me: sure, as i have a a couple of field jobs to complete anyway.

I however while i was checking our server settings, i noticed the battery icon in the corner of the screen didn't have the power cable icon with it, so the laptops were drawing from the batteries not the main power supply....

Me: IT, i think i know the issue, it the main switches live for me and OC?

IT: Why do you ask, they were turned on yesterday, i saw the electricians do it myself!

Me: Because the laptops are drawing from their batteries not the main power supply.

IT: Show me!

Sure enough, both mine and OC's laptops were doing the same thing. Then it dawns on him, he had been so busy setting up the office and also dealing with the server issues, he assumed that when the electricians added the new power supply plugs in the another companies office as a part of the retrofit, they switched on the power for those new plugs at the switchboard once they completed testing..... Apparently not!

So all users who were using the existing plugs in the office, they could work fine, but both OC and myself were a part of the group who be using the newly installed plugs so while some of main power plugs that were switched on at the wall, not all of them were actually live!

You know... Doctor Smith.,"So I work for a medical group that operates multiple hospitals over several states. 

I get a call from a younger lady, probably in her late teens. We have a vocational program and highschool or college students often sign up to be secretaries or other such to get their feet wet in the medical field.

I open with the standard greeting. ""This is OP with Hospital Healthcare. How can we assist you?""

YL: ""Hi, I am YoungLady and, I have a problem with a laptop. Well. It's not mine actually, it belongs to Dr. Smith."" 

ME: ""Ah, not a problem, can you tell me the ID number on the laptop. Its on a sticker on the bottem.""

YL: ""Well I don't have it with me. The screen is cracked and Dr. Smith says he wants to drop it by tonight on his way out. He would like a new one ready to go."" 

Note: This is a common occurrence. Our doctors are by no means abusive towards their IT equipment, but a hospital can be a dangerous place for a laptop. Also the desire to have a fresh replacement is reasonable. Everything is cloud based so we just need to get it imaged, and slap whatever software the user is supposed to have. A pick up and drop off like this is the usual way the situation is handled. 

ME: ""That won't be a problem. Since you Don't have the laptop, why Don't you just give me Dr. Smith's full name? I can look them up by that.""

YL: ""Well you see... I just started here and I don't know his full name. Isn't Doctor Smith enough?""

ME: ""Well there are currently 72 employees with Hospital Helthcare that have the last name Smith. 31 of which are Doctors. Can you tell me what hospital he works at?""

YL: ""Yes, he works at Huge State Hospital!""

ME: ""Well, that narrows it down to three. Can you tell me what room number he is in?""

YL: ""well.. um... he is... how do I say it. He is the... black one.""

Me: ""Well... I don't have that in my notes here. Why don't you tell me what department he works in?"" 

I can hear the utter embarrassment rise as Ms Young Lady talks again. 

""Well... its the... the part where.... um...""

And then I hear and older lady shout across the office:

Dr. John Smith.
Huge State Hospital. 
Suite 101: GYN
PCN: ABCD12345678

I write all that down. 

Me: ""That will do it. Dr. Smith's new laptop will be ready in about two hours. Would you like a ticket number?""

Bad day :(,"So I work tech support for a company and he needed help erasing his old iPhone and also wanted to start fresh using his new one. We support iPhones and some other Apple devices so I took it, but there seems to be a bunch of issues. So on his new phone that he JUST set up before he called me, there was a passcode. And he’s like I don’t remember setting this passcode!! It turns out to be the passcode to his old phone and he doesn’t understand why, so I politely tell him it might be because he set that passcode during set up, which he insists he didn’t do. 

So I’m like ok we can reset it again to factory settings if you want since he was feeling paranoid it was linked to the old phone and he thinks there’s a lot of security issues with his old phone. Well we’re going through the set up process again for the new phone it seems like there’s a SIM card in the new phone even tho he’s calling from his old phone since he can access cellular data on the new phone. I tell him to check the sim tray and seems to be another SIM card in there. He asks me where it came from and I told him it must be his carrier or Apple can give you one if you ask and he says he didn’t then he got extremely angry at me and started cursing me out, saying I’m an idiot who doesn’t know anything. Like how am i supposed to know why there’s a sim card in there?? I politely tell him he can talk to my senior advisor and he’s like yes and then starts insulting me. I try to transfer but then he stops and starts asking about ME and my work ID and for me to verify I work for said company even though HE CALLED US.

The Day the Government stood still,"**$IT-Head**: The head of IT and actually doing IT work. A religious worshipper and Apostle of Steve Jobs. (I was 'forced' by him to to watch a 4 hour documentary about the life/Success/And Everything else you ever wanted to know but were ever afraid to ask about Jobs. No, there was no test.). All around nice guy though and very much still a child at heart.

**$IT-Supreme:** The Boss of $IT-Head. To call him complicated would be an understatement and he was all too well known with HR for his various escapades.

**$IT-Dummy**: Not me. The Mysterious malovent entity in this story. No name was ever given for The One responsible for THE INCIDENT but hushed whispers amongst the people working in IT were pinpointing to a certain never-do-well who had brought the Apocalypse and Misfortune to our doorsteps.

 **$Me** : Me of course. Hullo again. Let me weave you a tale of Sorrow and Suffering and Jubilation\~

 \---

&amp;#x200B;

It has been years since I worked for the Government and I must say, in retrospect it was the most cushiest job I ever did as a Junior IT Guy. Your regular work day could start as early as 6:30 AM if you wanted, but nothing would actually happen until it was 8:30 AM. So the earlier you came, the more time you had for coffee, doing nothing, and getting paid. Plus overtime was meticularily logged. You worked for 8 Hours and 1 Minute? That 1 minute was logged and you had it the next day.

Unless there were meetings scheduled for the day, which regularily went something like this:

""What about Topic A?""  
""No news and information since Z."" (And let Z be anything from last year to 7 years ago)

""What about Topic B?""  
""No news and information since Z."" (And let Z be anything from last year to 7 years ago)

And this repeated for more than two to three hours. Since the meetings usually did start around 9 AM left that people with 1 hour for some work in the early mornings, at best, and lunch was anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours after the meeting. So in the best cases you had an active work time of maaaaybe around 2 or 3 hours on those meeting heavy days. 

And stuff still got done, which only showed that a well oiled IT machine does not need a whole lot of work. 

And I must say the IT there was good and fascinating. Brother Fax Devices have a tendency to send data packages back to their headquarters for costumer service and care. What is inside of them? Government stuff, so top secret. When it was inquired how to stop that the **$IT-Head** was told that it could not be deactivated and he had to live with it.

So he configured the routers so that all packages send by Brother Fax were routed to 127.X and never would arrive home.

A computer fried itself? Get a new one out of storage, pump it onto the Desk of the User and all of the Software will be reinstalled within 30 to 45 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Now this story actually starts years back, back when Windows XP support was slowly running out and the oh so new Windows 7 was arriving like usain Bolt on the market, totally crushing everyone involved in a blazing glory of rapid development. 

Normal users already had it Beta tested it for only narrowly 6 years and the Government was still not entirely sure if it would be the next best thing. But alas, April was looming over the horizon and they only had 2 more months to do the switch to the new OS else they would be running an outdated OS and break their own laws.

So words were shouted into telephones, people were made to run around and test all sorts of legacy programs and if they would run under the new OS and if not, if there were alternatives. And again I must say, IT was pretty impressive and very thorough with the testing. Considering the IT Department was around 15 people and they had around 400 different Programs to test, some of which came from the old years of the Pioneers and Windows 3.1 where they used to smash rocks together to create programs and scripts.

But alas, some of that work fell into my hands as well as a Junior IT Tech. My business was checking old templates and if they would work in W7. Most of the newer ones, mainky the ones after W98 did. The ones that came before though... No. If I was lucky the template would at least display some data. In the unlucky cases id didn't do anything whatsoever.

So I did my research and there are websites and programms that could convert old templates to working new ones but alas, those templates would be saved on the Programms server and its the Government.

So, secrecy. Top secret files and stuff and none of that was allowed on ANY server not owned by the Government. 

In the end IT just decided that the dozen or so templates that did not work would have to be recreated by the Users and they would get an old XP machine that had no internet connection, nor any network card for that matter, as to see the source of the old template and do the transition.

Each week the IT said their 'Ave Microsoft Oh Thou art in Heaven' when another deployment ran successfully and a Department was switched over to Win7. Sometimes though it failed completely and none of the machines had the new OS, but a quick boot to the head of the server got the machine in line and it would deploy it quickly the next night.

Then there were the smaller fails, one or two computers that would just not update and who would need to be convinced via some USB action and a boot stick. Or another push by the install server.

&amp;#x200B;

April came and passed and all the machines were switched to W7. Lots of shoulders were pat  and congratulations for a job well done were said. It only took them two months to do the switch after all.

And along with that switch came a brand new Microsoft SCCM software deployment system.

As any aspiring IT tech I wanted to take a look at it and see what it can do but that idea was shut down by **$IT-Supreme.**

&amp;#x200B;

**$IT-Supreme:** You will not have access to it. What if you screw something up? What if you install software you are not allowed to? You are just a Junior afterall! You know nothing about it!

**$Me:** Just give me an Observer role then? With no rights to install, move around anything? Just so that I can look at it?

**$IT-Supreme: NO! There are no needs for other roles but Administrators! And they all know what they are doing and you do not! So you shall not get access!**

Now there is that thing called Karma and if you have read this Subreddit you probably can take a guess as to what happened next. 

&amp;#x200B;

I however shall provide you with a picture painted with words to help support your imagination of the ensuing mayhem and Terror.

It was the end of the month, the Major of the city needed to know what the expanses of the city are and how much funds he still had to spend. There were time critical projects and contracts running out that had to be renewed or renogiated. Over a hundred inspections of various facilities, companies, and other business were done by specialized Government workers. Extensive reports detailing short comings, or success, in these facilities had been written and documented on laptops. Each of them more than 30 pages long, often times even longer than that.

And then, over the weekend... Every. Single. Computer. Was. Reinstalled.

No wait, that is not entirely correct. The installation process was started but the Network was just not able to handle around 4k computers.

At best the Network and server could reinstall 70 to 80 computers, something that had become obvious when different Departments got deployed with the Win7 Rollout. Remember when I mentioned that the IT did these installs daily over weeks and only switched single departments and not all of them? Yeah. That was for a reason.

So now we have 3k computers, all stuck on 1-3% installation and just would and could not progress because the Server had Epsteined itself via installations.

But that is not all, oh no! There are still things to come! Sights to see! 

See, once they started the reinstall they were out of the SCCM connection and server too. Which means that you could NOT restart the installation, as the BIOS was also getting a flush and did not initialise properly.

So now there is 3k computers, all who need to be single handedly reinstalled via USB-stick. 

""But wait, there is more!"" Billy Mays says, ""Remember all of those external workers that were writing reports on Company's and more? They didn't have access to their net drives, because security reasons and unsecured network, and so all of the reports were saved locally. On the C:/ drive. And what happens when you do a full reinstall? Poof. All of the work just gone. All those files are lost in time, like tears in rain. And unlike their brethren who got stuck in the installation, with all of the installations cancelled has the Network now the time for a proper reinstall.""

You may now start the wincing and the clutching of your computer, and start thinking about backup strategies. That is a perfectly normal reaction, or so I am told, because imagine coming to work after doing 5 of these reports, each of them 30 pages long. Hard work for days and you just want to finalize them and be done with that shit. You plug in your computer, and then are greeted instantly by the sweet message that its getting reinstalled.

And when you call IT in a panic as you watch that Progress bar creep forward like a Snake stalking a young chick they tell you they can't cancel it nor get your data back.

\---

And this is the end of the story. No heads rolled, no one was fired, no one was crucified or found dangling from the ceiling by a cat5 cable. People where asking of course, who had been the **$IT-Dummy** who had caused this? But no names were ever mentioned and no one stepped forward.

The estimated damages ran around 2 Million $ as for more than two weeks no one could work, and all these reports that had been mentioned previously, were lost. The Mayor was pissed. The Departments were pissed. The Department Heads were pissed. I do not think there was anyone that was not pissed. Me on the other hand had the only working computer, nothing to do because the big bosses were all busy, and I was allowed to Browse the web at my leasure until things were fixed  because I didn't have the rights to try and fix anything cuz I might break it, according to the immortal words of **$IT-Supreme**.

&amp;#x200B;

And once all was fixed and all of the computers were running again, was there only a single task for me left to do. Which was to write a programm that would interface with SCCM, without directly displaying the SCCM interface, and would allow users to install a single computer at a time and no longer do batch installations. 

I also did a security review and highly suggested the implementation of various roles, for the Juniors and other people in the IT Department, so that only those that actually deal with installing computers and Software have access and are allowed to do so. The rest can simply look but can't touch without permission, a concept that should be familiar to everyone.

But hey, what do I know. I am just a Junior after all and it was  **$IT-Supreme's** decision to enact those policies or not.

For all what it is worth it though, programming that tool was fun and writing up the security guidelines was hella fun and interesting. Albeit I still could not wait to get out of there because Government will make you go crazy with its paperwork. Though, I still miss the coffee and the very relaxed working times.",1161,0,1
Paperwork for paperwork's sake,"This is the tale of how I got the reputation of being a miracle worker.

In 2014, I was the IT Department of a timber furniture company based locally.  They made tables, beds, desks, everything you could think of, out of wood.  I not only fixed the office computers, but also was a software developer and fixed the computer side of the large CNC machines on the factory floor.

I was answering a support call one morning when I noticed that this was an actual flaw in the operating procedures.  Essentially, pieces of ""ironmongery"" - any fastners, latches, handles, hinges, screws etc that attached to the furniture - could be ordered from us directly and shipped out, but there was no system to do this.  The sales team found the item in our catalog, wrote the part numbers on a pre-printed form and hand-delivered it to the stock office.  Stock people then entered those numbers into their stock system, found the item and sent it on yet another hand-written form to Transport, who would then add it manually as a part-load into the transport system for delivery.  The support call was that the stock number didn't exist so it must be a fault.  As you can guess, someone had scruffy handwriting and made a 6 look like an 8.

I went back to my office and started to add a module to our Order management software to do exactly this.  It took about 3 weeks including testing, and I was just about to roll it out, when I get an email inviting me to a kaizen meeting. 

If you've not heard of one, it's basically part of the continual improvement cycle for manufacturing, based on a Japanese idea.  the meetings are 15 minutes long, and you assign tasks and report on the resolved tasks.  The initial meeting chooses roles, lays out the problem and starts the ball rolling.  Our version had a minimum resolution time of five weeks, one meeting a week.  The last meeting was not meant to have a completed solution, but to know how to get the completed solution.

I attended the first meeting, and mentioned that I could have this resolved and working quickly.  I knew what the issue was and how to resolve it.  I didn't tell them I already had, because I wanted to see where this was going.

Naturally I was told by the leader that we had to follow the rules of the meeting, and that there would be 5 more after this one.  I took a back seat, except to answer questions about my areas of expertise.  I played their game.

Second Meeting, and the leader finds an expensive piece of software (12k + 2k per machine) that would do the job.  We would need twenty licences at least.  I was asked to test a demo copy.

Third meeting - Software was actually quite easy to use and configure, but all machines using it needed to be on the latest version of windows with the latest version of office.  on top of the software costs, the upgrade costs alone would be expensive.

fourth meeting - I suggested using a word template or a spreadsheet to enter the data digitally, that way it could be emailed and printed as a record.

Fifth meeting, everyone agreed that this would be good short term, but longer term specialist software was needed.  I was asked to investigate if I could write it.

Yes, 5 meetings in, someone suggested using the IT department properly.  It had not occurred to them until that point.

Final meeting - I told them that it would take me about 5 weeks without interruption in order to get this done.  Meeting wrapped up, notes handed in and filled in the official paperwork (by hand!) to submit to management to show that we had been effective.

I made small tweaks to the software that I had written 5 weeks ago in accordance with some minor things they said they wanted.  It took an afternoon.  I then spent the next 3 work days browsing reddit and imgur, before pressing the deploy button.

The following morning I introduced the new stock tracking and ordering system to management, and they were amazed.  We even won the prize for most successful kaizen.

Please let me help you.,"This has literally just happened. My forehead is bruised from smacking it on the table.

**Background**. Our team offer tech and sales support, we in turn are supported by a call-centre helpdesk, but we deal with the high level stuff and commercials, and booking work in.

I don't care if it's not secure.,"So I'm working in first level tech support for a rather large governmental company that's working in the healthcare sector. We work with many other smaller company's like the Red cross or various elderly daycare centers etc... and our company often exchanges confidental data with those companies. Most people in our company do it by sending password protected zip archives via email.

I get a call nothing strange so far. I pick up say my generic greeting and wait till the the person descripes her problem. She wants that if you right click on the protected file the password appears. I told her that this is not possible since it's a third party application which we cannot edit and the most important part is that even if theoreticaly we would do it that it would complete negate the security factor. She then began to rant about that we are all incompetent. I once again tried to calmly tell her that because of security concerns and because the application is third party that this wasn't possible. She completly ignored me and continued her rant. At this point I didn't know what to do now and proposed that she can talk to my manager. She declined, wished me a good day in a very sarcastic way and hung up.

"She got a new desktop background, so I got compared to Hilter","I used to do phone technical support for a large company. I had to deal with a lot of shit over the years, but only *once* did I snap and talk back to a user. Surprisingly, it didn't go bad for me...

My company decided to standardize all of their computers, changing the desktop background to the blue company logo (instead of allowing users to put whatever random photos up that could be seen by clients). Of course, this resulted in *lots* of calls to the help desk about it.

I got a call from a manager and went through the same script I'd said a hundred times already: ""The company decided to use a standard image..."", ""No, I'm sorry you can't change it..."" etc.

The woman paused, then said:

&gt;Well, I see *Hitler* is alive and well!

I was already annoyed at how much people were complaining about this, and now she compared it to *fucking Hitler!?!*

I responded calmly:

&gt;Actually maam, Hitler killed millions of people. *This* (pause), is just a blue background.

Then I sat in silence, waiting for her to respond. The reality of what she said hit her full force - she quickly fumbled apologies and and hung up.

"Making sure we're in agreement, because I'm sorry","So this isn't my story, but rather my father's (I wouldn't be surprised if he sees this, since he uses Reddit). It's also pretty short.

He used to work in tech support, and at the place that he worked, they'd get calls from various people, from local people trying to get their new computers to work, to companies needing system wide assistance. The company charged people by the hour, where the moment a worker arrived, even if they were only there for 10 minutes, the client would be charged for an hour of work.

One day the company got a report from a someone (Can't remember if it was a single person or company, been awhile since he last told it) saying that their computer wasn't running properly. My dad went out to go help fix the problem. He got there, and they showed him to the computer. He took one look at it, and said ""You do know, that we do charge an hourly fee, no matter how long we're here, right?"" The client confirmed it. ""Alright, just making sure we're in agreement, because I'm sorry."" He went over to the computer, and pressed one button. During this time, computers tended to have a 'Turbo"" button, which would switch the computer between two run states, one that was slower, and one that was faster. My dad simply pressed the turbo button, which set the computer to the proper run state.

He and the client had a good laugh about it, but my dad felt a little bad since he hadn't even been there for 5 minutes and he was already done, and the client had been charged for an hour's time of work. He doesn't work in tech support now, but still loves that story, and also still messes with computers (His house is FILLED with parts and wires).",108,0,1
How many tries to connect....too many,"This is more of a minor rant than anything else.  I do service desk for a large hospital and we have a LOT of staff working at home.  Most of them have figured out how to do this and not call in daily but then there's this lady.

FOUR more times.  Finally on attempt 5 when my patience is pretty much gone I have her shut down the remote desktop connection (because she was too dumb to just minimize it) and I connect to the actual computer she's working on.  20 seconds later I've fixed the issue and I get off the call.

The call comes in.  I'm working swing shift at this point, or some equivalent of it.  

**Me:** Goooood evening, thanks for calling $mobile\_carrier super-duper support, this is u/dennisthetiger, what can I solve for you tonight?

It's a warm transfer, as it should be.  There are two ways into this level of support: either by transfer in from the customer phone tree, or by phoning in a not-so-well-hidden unlisted number to get into our queue (because hey, that's how phones work).  This was the former, of course.  

The agent tells me what I need to know: customer vital information, I have the account.  Spanish speaker, I'm gonna need an interpreter.  Customer looking to set up his phone as a modem.  Samsung flip phone.  Alright, easy but it's gonna take a while because the extra layer from the interpreter will inevitably increase the time spent on the phone.  We get him on, negotiate.  He's got the cable.  Good.  Software's not installed...not so good, we're gonna need that.

Fifteen minutes later, software's installed and he can even back up his phone.  Awesome!  Set up provisioning for internet aaaaaand it's ready.  We now go through the routine and he can dial up to the internet.  Can browse and everything.

Then this happens.

**Me:** Any other questions?

**Customer:** I have one more question for you.

**Me:** go for it.

**Customer:** *How does this help with the fact that I can't send picture messages?*

...what?!  OK, now I""m just embarrassed.  There were a few seconds of silence on the call.

**Me:** Wait, you weren't planning on setting this up as a modem?

**C:** No.

...oh my fscking gods.  

Now I'm livid.  Forty-five minutes on with this poor guy and interpreter, and we just wasted it because *the previous agent lied to me*. It's probably worth noting that $mobile\_carrier is really big on customer experience, and to detract from that can be grounds for termination.

Cue profuse apologies for this one, with an explanation to what happened.  The topic of phone as modem had not once come up in conversation with the previous agent, it was all about the MMS.  Turned off the internet provisioning, MMS does not need this.

I ultimately got him back to the proper department - the device was a $mobile\_carrier branded device, so there is not much reason that this should simply malfunction short of a network error or software glitch.  Sometimes sending an over-the-air config helps, but not always.  Cue up an internal report for the jackass that fibbed his way out of the call.  I suspect he stopped working for them shortly thereafter.

At least he could use his phone as a backup connection to the internet if need be.

Computer won't turn on...,"So this may sound like a tech support urban legend type of story, but I swear it is sadly true...

* Her: No, it's on a desk.
* Me: Ohkay... are you unable to look behind the computer for the cables?
* Her: I can't right now, because I can't see anything in the room.
* Me: Um, what do you mean you can't see anything in the room?
* Her:  The lights won't turn on, so I can't check the cables.

I’m going to turn this over to the FBI,"Background: I work at a call center that provides support for various hardware and software vendors. We act as a distributor and end users buy via resellers, for this reason new accounts might not know who we are. One of our vendors is Microsoft (O365/Azure/etc) which means that the support chain looks something like Microsoft -&gt; us -&gt; reseller -&gt; end user. In order to provide support for a given end user they must consent to us being able to do so on their accounts. This looks like an email from us asking for admin access to their account. This email happens at one of two times, when they register their service or when they need to raise a ticket and we find out we don’t have access.

Story:

Me (M): Thank you for calling \[COMPANY\], my name is TLShandshake, how can I help?

Customer (C): One of my account admin’s just got an email from your company asking for access to their account. Who is this company and why did you send him this email?

M: What product or vendor was this for? Is it Microsoft?

C: Yes.

M: Ok, if you give me the tenant account name I can look them up in our system and see what is going on.

C: I want to know why you are sending this email!

M: (I’m now starting to think that due to us being buried under the reseller in the support chain he might be the end user and not know who we are and thinks this might be some sort of social engineering) Sir I am not sure why you received that email because I don’t know who you are.

C: I’m “Joe” (reader, his name clearly was not “Joe”)

M: Ok, and what company is on the account so I can look them up?

C: You know what, that’s fine I’m going to turn this over to the FBI and you can explain it to them!

\*click\*

I’m almost 100% positive that this was a legitimate email, but I couldn’t check to make sure. It is possible we were asking for something else as part of an existing case or maybe he really wasn’t our customer and an email was sent in error. I don’t know because he wanted a global company to look up an email to “Joe” to tell him why we sent it. Even if I could have found the email to someone named “Joe” that wouldn’t have helped because he lied about his name!

Well “Joe” did give me one clue to figure out who he was. He came up in the caller ID with a phone number, maybe with any luck this will yield results. I put it in Google and sure enough the top result is a company with this same number listed as their contact number. I take the company name and look it up in our system, there is a hit. It was as I thought, they were an end user who just hadn’t been made aware of who we were by their reseller.

I sent an email to my higher ups telling them to prepare for the ensuing FBI investigation…

How I Accidentally Completed A Three Month Project in Three Days,"Oh boy, is this a long one. Apologies for formatting and how I tell the story, but I've been wanting to tell this for a while now, and I think enough time has passed, so I thought I would share. TL;DR at the bottom.  

Backstory
Over a year ago, the IT department started using a new product for desktop management. This product is mainly used by Help Desk to remote into a user's computer for troubleshooting, but is also used by the department to remotely install/uninstall software. It was also around the same time our department decided to eventually switch from Office 20xx to O365 so we could start using Outlook. The plan was to start pushing out O365 to our smaller, remote sites first, then our HQ, dept by dept, gradually getting everyone used to it before we announced we were going to start using Outlook.  

As I said before, the desktop management product was new to the company, so the entire IT department was still trying to learn its features and quirks. One of the first things I learned about the product was that I could schedule an uninstall of one program, and an install of another, in the same configuration, but the uninstall had to be specific (i.e. if I scheduled an uninstall of Office 2013 Standard x86, but one of the machines had x64 or Pro x86, the push would fail).   

Another thing I learned was that if I filtered out the machines based on location, not every machine would get the push. If a user was working from home, ""technically"" they were not at the location so they wouldn't receive the push. To save time, I would select our domain, filter it down to the OU the machines were in, then, if needed, exclude certain machines from receiving the push. (This would cause a problem later)  

The Tale
For the first month or so, I would push out the Office uninstall/O365 install every Friday night to one or two sites, then check on it Monday morning. The process was always the same: pick the site, check the Office version for each machine in the site, then create schedules to uninstall/install. Each schedule was based on what version the machines had. At this point, I only had a couple sites left before starting on our HQ. We expected to be done in about three months.  

So one Friday, I am getting ready to schedule the push to one of the remote sites. There's only about 20 machines in this site. I go about my normal procedure: compare Office versions between machines, create the schedules based on Office versions, check on Monday. I started creating the schedule, picked the time (11 PM that night), select the domain, filter down to the OU, start putting in machines to exclude.  

At some point, I noticed one of the machines I excluded is incorrect. I clicked to remove it from the list, but all my excluded machines disappear from the list. ""Weird."" I thought, but it shouldn't be a problem. Just add the machines to the excluded list again. At this moment, I get distracted by a co-worker that there's a meeting I need to be a part of, and it starts in one minute, all the way on the other side of the building. I quickly double-check the excluded list, click ""Deploy"", and head off to the meeting.  

After the meeting, I finished scheduling another push for another site (10 machines), then go home. The process had become so repetitive, I don't even think to double-check the schedules.

The following Monday morning, I arrive at work at 7 AM. I'm in a pretty good mood, which is kinda rare for a Monday. I get logged in, get my headset ready for any calls, then start checking on my pushes.

I check the other site's upgrade first. 10 machines successfully uninstalled Office 20xx, and installed O365. Everything went according to plan. Awesome! Go check the other site, 700+ machines successful, 550+ fail.... WHAT?! Why did 1200+ machines receive the push?!  

Apparently, when I clicked on the incorrect machine to remove from the excluded list, and all the machines in the list disappeared, it also wiped out my filter for the OU, thereby going to the entire domain. 1200+ PCs, laptops, AND servers.  

My good mood is immediately replaced by panic. I run to the the SysAdmin and inform him what had happened. He chuckles, and says, ""That makes sense. I was getting alerts all weekend that the servers were having service stops and CPU usage was higher than normal, but it would clear up after about 15 minutes. I thought there was a driver update or something."" Then the on-call person comes in and tells me he received calls nonstop all weekend from users who were having issues with Word and Excel, asking them to sign in.  

Once my boss comes in, I tell him exactly what happened: Still learning how to use the new product, I got distracted, but I didn't double-check my work. I own up to the mistake, and tell him I'll spend as much time as I need to make it right.  

The Aftermath
My boss wasn't upset. In fact, he wanted everyone switched over to O365 as soon as possible. By pure luck, my mistake happened to do exactly what he wanted (except for installing on the servers though. That's still a my bad). He sent out a company-wide email, letting everyone know we were eventually switching over to Outlook, just needed to get the software in place first. Users that used any Office product regularly would need to call the Help Desk to get their license set up so they could get signed into it.  By 9 AM that morning, we had licenses applied to the entire company.  

I spent the rest of the day doing clean up. Everyone was really cool about it. They waited about a week before they started giving me crap.  As for the company, everyone not in IT appreciated the heads-up about the transition, and they actually looked forward to the switch. I now double-check my pushes every time, no matter how big or small.  

TL;DR - Company was transitioning to O365 over a three month period. Created a scheduled install to a remote site, but didn't double-check my configuration. Ended up installing O365 on every PC, laptop, and server on the domain over a weekend.",3387,0,1
"You sucked acid into your mouth, and want to blame me?","I do a lot of field service work on water analysers. Some are clean water applications, others are dirty water applications. 

The dirty water applications often require inline filters to remove solids from the sample water, a cleaning cycle built in the water analyser, and other things like that. 

Some cleaning cycles use a cleaning solution that is flushed through the system. 

This particular story starts where the customer had not replaced the inline filter in their sample like fit around a week. It’s supposed to be replaced every day. This lead to the filter getting completely blocked, and eventually the pressure built up at it and the tubing came off, spilling water into the analyser. 

When the operator saw this they called their technician. 

The technician comes down several hours later, after the operator has left site, removes the blocked filter, couldn’t find a clean one, and just connected the tubes together. So now the analyser doesn’t have any filtration. He doesn’t saw this to anybody, and doesn’t follow up the next day. 

A few days after that there’s a lot of issues with the analyser. Readings are all over the place, the tubing looks terrible, stuff like that. The technician (same guy as last time) gets called down again, can’t fix it. There’s too many blockages in the system, and the times cleaning cycle isn’t enough to keep it clean enough (it runs once every 6 hours). 

They speak to an engineer on site, is given my contact information and also told to just replace the tubing and other parts that are blocked. They didn’t contact me and start replacing tubing in the analyser. 

One of the tubes removed from a blocked valve was for the cleaning solution (a 2 mol HCl solution), which released the pressure on the line, and the solution in the line will flow back into the bottle below the analyser. When removing these lines you’re supposed to use a clamp, to prevent the whole bottle of solution from possibly getting contaminated. 

If this tubing was being replaced with new tubing, you would prime the tube by connecting a syringe, pulling the solution up the tube, clamp the tube, remove the syringe, connect the tube to the valve and then remove the clamp. 

This technician was too lazy for all that. Instead of a clamp, pinch the tube. Instead of using syringe, use your mouth. This was a guy that laughed at people for wearing safety glasses and gloves. 

So he sucks a 2 mol solution of HCl into his mouth. He got a bit of a shock from that. 

I got an email a while later from a manager on site. Apparently the technician thought they this was their lucky day and could make a claim from this. Saying that the tube they disconnected didn’t have a warning label on it. 

I replied pointing on that this analyser was on a waste water treatment site, all safety data sheets for the reagents used in the analyser have been sent to the customer and a hard copy of those sheets is in the cabinet next to the analyser and that each of the reagent bottles are clearly labelled with the relevant chemical warning symbols. “Please let you know if you need any further information on this”. 

Didn’t get a reply. 

I was on site a few weeks later for some routine service work and was filled in on the details I didn’t get in that email.  The technician was still working on the site, had initially been making a big deal out of the incident but very quickly shut up when the health and safety people on site started questioning him after I replied to that manager.",732,0,1
Why you should do backups regularly,"So again a few words about me:

I work for a mechanical engineering company.

Most times those machines are at least as big as a typical suburb house and cost at least that much.

Information intermission:

Those machines need to have a “big service” at least every 1-2 years. During this the calibration data will be replaced / recalibrated.

On old machines this data is incremental so you can’t just read in the latest calibration data, it needs ALL of it. Restoring one of this calibration data backups takes approx. 30-45 minutes and you have about 50% chance it’s failing...

$maint: I need good news so start with those

Not uninstall the app and delete the local files and pray the user doesn't reinstall the app ever in the future

I transferred the call and checked back the next day. Luckily the software had a restore feature but it was not a simple process and he had to babysit the progress throughout the evening, with all managers and the current updated very regularly on his progress

$Programmer: (Tuesday) i didnt want any programs installed on my new computer. Just windows and outlook. Ill install everything else myself.

$Me: ...ok? So u want me to go back up to the office and wipe your brand new computer so that you can install the stuff i already installed on it?

$Programmer: yes

$Me: (Wednesday, goes to office yesterday n wipes brand new computer for no fucking reason whatsoever.)

$Programmer: (Friday) hey do we have an installer for visual studio 2019?

$Me: all installers are on \\networkDrive\microsoft\visual studio

$Programmer: yeah but those only go up to 2017

$Me: so theres no 2019 in there

$Programmer: no it goes from 2002 to 2017

$Me: so 2017 is the most recent we have?

$Programmer: yes

$Me: so we dont have 2019?

$Programmer: i dont know thats what I'm asking

$Me: is it in the folder?

$Programmer: no

$Me: so we don't have it?

$Programmer: i dont know

$Me: 2 things.... 1st he had me wipe it completely out because he wanted to do it himself. 2 we dont have 2019.

$Boss: so we dont have it?

$Me: no we only have up to 17

$Boss: so why didnt you out 2017 on it?

$Me: he told me not to

$Boss: and now he cant put 2019 on it himself

$Me: thats because we dont have it

$Boss: why dont we have it?

$Me: ...i guess because nobodys ever bought it...

$Boss: can you just put it on there for him?

$Me: i dont have a company card....i cant buy it.... $Programmer has a company card...and he wanted to do it hisself. So why cant he buy it and install it?

$Boss: he doesnt know how

Please don't tell me that.,"My helpdesk job deals a lot with security of medical information and sales persons in the field. 

We require unique PINs as verification for the field reps as proof of who they are. 

This tale is of a Regional Manager (RM) with a brand new sales person (BN) calling in for some help with the first time set up. 

Me: Hello, this is the Sales HelpDesk. 

RM: Hi, this is RM and I have BN here with me and we're trying to -blah blah, actual issue that I fix later.- and we need to get that fixed. 

Me: alrighty, I'll need both of your PINs for verification. 

RM: 123419

BN: I don't have a PIN. 

Me: Then let's set you up can I have your -very sensitive information- to verify your identity? 

BN: -very sensitive information- 

Me: Great, now I'll just need a 6 digit nu-

RM: here's what I do, I just use my bank PIN and repeat the first two numbers at the end. Then in 4 months I increment the last number and you're golden for a few years. 

BN: oh, okay... 345634

Me: -with head on desk- congratulations you have a new PIN. 

Why? Why would you tie those together? And admit to it, with another person in the room? Why?!",330,0,1
The HelpDesk cannot make you computer literate.,"One of the most common calls I get is new field reps who get lost in the documentation. 

Admittedly, the documentation is bad. I've submitted a revised version, but haven't heard anything on the subject of implementing it. 

This story (I've been a bit rapid fire today and inspired to put more out there.) is about a new user (NU) that needed a lot of help. 

Here's a taste of a 2 hour call to go through 7 steps of the first page of new user set up. 


Me: Helpdesk this is Me speaking, can I get your Name and PIN? 

NU: What's a PIN? 

Me: it's a person identification number.

NU: I get that, but what's a PIN and why do I need one. 

Me: It's a personal identification number, that we use as your personal identification to ensure you are who you say you are. Can't be too careful when it comes to sensitive medical information. 

NU: oh, okay... Well I don't have one. 

-we go through the process of creating her PIN-

Me: there we go, now you're good to go, what seems to be the problem. 

NU: I can't seem to connect to the... V... P... N? 

Me: -pulling out the information packet that is still on my desk due to starting the previous week.-  Okay, we're going to flip to page 43 in the packet. 

NU: That's where I am.

Me: What step are you on? 

NU: one

Me: okay, so we're going to click on the -VPN app- icon at the bottom right. It looks like a Q.

NU: the Q? -keyboard clack- 

Me: on the bottom right of your screen there's a Q icon. 

NU: -Keyboard clack- it's not doing anything.

Me: okay, look to the bottom left. 

Nu: I thought you said the bottom right

Me: I did, but we're going a different route. It'll be easier when I connect to your computer (or so I thought.)

-insert 10 minutes of getting the user to open up TeamViewer, and then having to explain TWICE to stop closing the client as I'm connecting.- 

Me: alright, see where my mouse cursor is? On the right? On the Q? 

NU: Yes. 

Me:Okay, I'm going to click on the Q and it will open this box, now I'm going to click on the connect button. 

-click click, login prompt appears- 

Me: okay, log in with the password in your packet. 

NU: wait wait... How did you do that? How did we get to this login screen?

Me: -closes it- 

Nu: oh! Where did it go? 

Me: I'm going to show you how to open it again. 

-details the steps.- 

Nu: oh, okay, so we're going to click on this green box. 

.... 

Me: we're going to click on the Q. That's the VPN app.

NU: okay, but what is a VPN? 

Me: it's like a secure connection between you and the company. 

NU: okay, but what is it for. 

Me: it's to ensure the safety of the sensitive information your job entitles you to. 

NU: now, $me, I fully understand the importance of security for my job... But what's a VPN. 

Me: it's like a secured tunnel between you and the company. Only people that have accounts and passwords can access the tunnel. 

NU: oh ...

-10 more minutes to get her to click the Q, another 15 minutes to explain the asinine password restrictions. Now we're on step 5, setting up the MFA.- 

NU: what's this .. Trio app, and why do I have to put it on my phone? 

Me: it's another form of authentication to make sure you are who you are. 

Nu: but how does that work with the VPN? 

Me: alrighty, the VPN is a tunnel right? 

Nu: yeah

Me: the first gate asks for your password and username. 

NU: okay

Me: there's a second gate, just to make sure you are who you say you are. This is what that is. If someone steals your laptop, and knows your username and password, then they still can't get at the information, because they don't have your phone. 

NU: oh, okay... But what is Multi-factor- authentication? 

Me: -mutes my microphone so I can cry-

I could keep going, but I'm starting to grind my teeth from the memory.

I actually ended the call with a migraine and needed my lunch hour for the Excedrin to kick in.

There was another 2 steps we went through because I knew for a fact that the information in the packet was wrong. They would be calling back within the hour for the issue that misinformation causes. 
 It took another hour explaining everything from what Chrome is, what the main website is, to why we are going into another part of the website and finally another password change.

"""I'm an idiot"" At Least You're Honest","Hello again all,

This is a story that happened to me yesterday, and this lady might take the title of worst listener.

The characters:

Doesn't Listen: Or DL for short, she's our user for this story and as her name suggests she doesn't listen... at all.

Me: Our story teller

This day in particular was a very busy day with a particularly high call volume which is odd for a Thursday. I made it to the second half of the day and so far no really annoying issues.

Then ***she*** calls in...

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Hello and thank you for contacting \[insert name of company here\] my name is EonThief how can I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: HELLO?

At this point I believe maybe I have my mic muted, nope, so I repeat my opening again.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;DL: Yes, hello this is DL and I'm having issues with a training, it's not loading and it says to check my pop up blocker but I don't know how to do that.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay ma'am I can definitely assist with getting this issue, I have a few things that I can try and if those don't work I will escalate this to the proper team.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY! Good.

Yes she did raise her voice when she said that... every time she said that as well.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Well first things first I'm going to need you to remote me into your computer so I can take a look at the problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: Sorry I'm an idiot, how do I do that?

Now, I'm used to hearing ""I'm computer illiterate"" or ""I don't understand computers"" but never have I heard a user refer to themselves as an idiot.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Well I need you to close all open windows.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY!

A few minutes go by and I don't hear anything except for the sound of her breathing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Alright ma'am have you closed all the windows?  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: You wanted me to close the windows?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me:...Yes ma'am I need you to close all open windows.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY!

A few more minutes and I check back in, same thing and at this point I feel like she might not know how to close the windows so I verify with her.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Ma'am do you know how to close the windows?  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: You click the ""X"" at the top right of the screen right?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yes that's right, can you please do that for me?  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY! I did it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Wonderful, describe your screen to me.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: It's my email.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Ma'am I asked you to close all open windows.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: Oh, OKAY!

Another few minutes pass and I go through the same song and dance again til I finally get her on her desktop.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Okay, now that you're on your desktop I need you to click on the picture of a man in a white shirt and headset.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Let me know once you've done that.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: I can't find it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I'm sorry?  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: Can't find it, isn't here.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Ma'am I need you to look again.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY!

Another moment goes by.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;DL: Found it!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay awesome, now click on it and let me know when you do.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY! it brought up names.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Click on my name, EonThief  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Now follow the prompts on your screen.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY! Are you in now?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: No ma'am it takes a bit I'll let you know when I'm remoted in.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY!

She proceeds to ask me this two more times, and I respond the same way each time. Once I'm in her computer I have her show me the issue. Sure enough the training video won't load.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Alright ma'am I have a few things I'm gonna try, so bear with me while I get those done.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY!

I verified once more that she had nothing else she needed to do and proceeded to do the troubleshooting. As I'm going through the steps I notice that the mouse isn't responsive and it turns out the user was still trying to do things on her end.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Ma'm I need you to stop moving the mouse on your end, it's preventing me from doing the necessary troubleshooting.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY!

Again I go in circles with her a few times, and she just refuses to listen. After the fifth time however I got fed up and locked her mouse and keyboard inputs.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;DL: Sir, sir! The mouse and keyboard aren't working anymore I think there is something wrong with them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Nothing is wrong with them ma'am I locked your inputs so I could perform the troubleshooting. I will unlock it once I am done.  
&gt;  
&gt;DL: OKAY!

Once again she must not have listened because she tells me five more times... It was at this point that I muted myself and introduced my head to my desk.

Once I finished the troubleshooting, I unlocked her controls and had her open her training. It opened and loaded no problems. I was thrilled that I was done, but she wanted to be sure that it worked.

Now my fellow redditors how do you think she wanted to verify that it worked?

If you guessed she wanted me to remain on the line while she completed a 2 hour training then you are correct!

I of course told her that I cannot remain on the line for that long, and she actually listened. Then with one final ""OKAY!"" she ended the call.",1550,0,1

Now, she's not very old (for reference I'm only a teen) but whenever she sees something related to accounts or something even mildly technical she asks me for help (read: to do it for her).

So as soon as she saw the notification, what do you think she did? SPOILER: She handed the phone to me. ""FloatingMilkshake, I need you to fix my phone."" It's like she didn't even read it...because she didn't.

Just send me a replacement,"So I used to do contract work for a tech retailer. We did just about everything that couldn’t be done in store. We handled their tech issues. We scheduled maintenance and construction. We reset passwords. Kind of a weird hodgepodge of tech support, remote site coordination, and log and pass. 

One of the things we did was we logged their damaged hardware, and we sent tickets to the main warehouse who would send out replacements, and then they would send back the damaged part to either be refurbished or sent in for warranty. 

For every replacement part, we needed the same information. 

Make and Model:

Asset Number:

Service Tag:

Serial Number:

Without fail. And if they don’t get us those things, we start the Contact/Close process. (Three contacts, close the ticket if they don’t reply, you all probably know the drill.)

User submits a portal ticket for a broken laptop. Asks for replacement. All she says is that it’s Brand X.

So I write back and ask her for the Model, Asset Number…etc. 

*She writes back saying that the part is broken and can’t be fixed in house, and to send her a new laptop of Brand X.* 

I write back again, tell her I would be happy to send out a replacement, but I need the information, remind her again what that is.

*User writes back saying that she doesn’t have the time to collect the information. Which is funny, because all of that information is literally on a sticker on the lid of the laptop. Even the make and model, just to be idiot-proof. I guide the user to the sticker.*

I write and inform her that it is policy I have all the asset information or I can't submit the part for replacement, and it's been the policy ever since I started working here a year ago.

*User writes back this long-winded thing about how she has worked for this company for over ten years, she was there when they opened the store, she’s the manager now. She’s handled more hardware replacements than I will ever know about and that she has never in her life had to provide the information I asked for and she shouldn’t have to. She says it’s broken, she wants it fixed, and if my next email doesn’t have a tracking number, then it better have my manager’s contact information.*

I tap my manager on the shoulder and he says, “Send me the store phone number.” He dials it. “Hi, this is !Manager, am I speaking to !User? Hi, I understand you were having some trouble ordering a replacement laptop? Alright, we’ll be happy to do that. Could you provide (part information)? No ma’am we do need it. We always need it. Also, if you had taken half the time to just provide that information than it must have taken you to write any of those emails to my tech, you would have your laptop by now.”

*User sends me the part information, I send it in, send her back a tracking number.*",242,0,1
I hate my tablet,"  

I used to do contract help desk work for an electronics retailer. One of the things we would do was log their damaged hardware and send in tickets to have replacements sent to the warehouse. We explicitly only handled break/fix hardware. Hardware refreshes through a different process and had to be approved by regional managers.

One of the things this retailer did was give all sales associates personal tablets to do their business with. Pretty standard, they all had special orders, inventory, and POS on the tablets.

*User submits portal ticket for a replacement tablet. He points out that the tablet is three generations old. It doesn’t work as quickly as the newer ones that new associates have. It doesn’t’ have the processing power, the memory, or all the bells and whistles he would like.*

I write back, inform user that our desk only handles break/fix. We do not do refreshes. Guide him to talk to his manager about a refresh. Close the ticket.

*User submits ticket, says that his tablet is old, and slow, and it doesn’t load the applications as quickly. He borrowed a current-gen tablet and that was so much nicer, so he wants one of those.*

I write back, inform user that our desk only handles break/fix. We do not do refreshes. Guide him to talk to his manager about a refresh. Close the ticket.

*User submits a ticket. Says that his tablet is old and slow and it’s impeding his work because it doesn’t work as fast as the new tablets. He also says that it’s a ""bad optic"" (his words, not mine) since the model he has isn’t even sold anymore. It doesn’t look good for customers to see him using the older tablet while he is trying to sell them the new one. He asks how can he ask customers to spend money that his employer won’t in order to get the latest equipment. He says he’s lost sales because customers see him with old equipment and it convinces them not to upgrade because they think something is wrong with the new models.*

I write back, inform user that our desk only handles break/fix. We do not do refreshes. Guide him to talk to his manager about a refresh. Close the ticket.

*User submits ticket. Tablet dropped. Screen broken. Needs replacement.*

Explain in terms the end user can understand.,"Hello everyone. A quick prologue before we begin. 

The onset of Covid saw me jobless, as the clients who employed my company became unable to pay them, which in turn made them unable to employ me. I spoke on that whole story previously. This one comes from a week into my new job, as Desktop support for a Healthcare group. This group owns and operates a splattering of hospitals and other care facilities across several states. All tech support is centrally located in the geographic center (give or take fifty feet) of the whole group. We are located in the upper floor of a doctor's office, who are themselves also part of the group. 

During my training period, I shadowed one of the lead imaging specialists, and would eventually join his ranks. Our job was to build new machines or refurbish old ones, putting fresh images on them and installing a list of software that the new owner of tje device requires for their job. 

On this particular day, a doctor walks into our little sanctum and asks to see the man in charge. He is directed to the lead I am with. 

He explains that he just recieved his new Win10 laptop and has discovered that the dictation software doesn't work. He understands that there is a process to these things and technically he needs to submit a ticket and wait to be contacted. However, he works downstairs rather than half a state over, so he doesn't see why he can't drop by and save everyone some time and paperwork. 

The problem is by no means an emergency, but he would like it fixed before it becomes one. Furthermore, he is rather busy himself, as he is sure we all are, so if this will be a 'quick fix' we can handle it now. Otherwise he would like to schedual an appointment so that his time away from his new laptop can be minimized. He doesnt want to ""Just put a note on it and place it in a bin.""

My lead is more than happy to assist, as we were not super busy. It would be a good learning opportunity for his new assistant as well. I am introduced, the customary pleasantries are exchanged (minus handshaking) and we dive in. 

It seems that the Doctor could not locate the software originally. To correct this, and again to save time and paperwork, he simply went to ""My Computer"". He assumed correctly that it held everything on his computer. He searched for the program in question and found the executable nestled in its folder in program files. He simply dragged the executable to his desktop, and found that upon clicking it, that it did not work. 

My lead returns the wayward executable to its home, while explaining that my moving it, the Docter had segregated it from the files it needed to do its job. The program was not broken, but simply deprived of its tools and resources. A shortcut is made and the software is tested to make sure it works. 

The doctor then brings up that the icon looks the same, and asks what was changed. The lead explains that he had made what is called a shortcut. He briefly explains how they work. The doctor watches the lead navigate through the folders to show where he placed the executable, and that it matched the path in the shortcut. The Docter inquires as to the need for folders in the first place, if all the files are unique and uniquely named, why not place all the executables on the desktop, and just tell them where the dump of files is. 

The lead explains with the following: ""That would be like wheeling the MRI machine into the lobby, to meet the patient before they check in and explain why they are there.""

The Doctor concludes that folders are like rooms and are there to keep everything organized. He thanks us and heads on his way. My lead then turns to me and shows me how to make a ticket for a Walk-In Incident.",180,0,1

I didn't realize future generations were more tech illiterate than my grandparents,"This one is going back a bit. I was a Junior in a trade high school, taking an IT class. For the first 10 weeks of school, incoming Freshmen try out 10 different trades to see a variety of ones they might like, not just the ones they are interested in. We had two teachers in the IT course, one taught the upperclassmen (Juniors and Seniors) and the other taught the underclassmen (Freshmen and Sophomore). The introduction to IT week is building a basic website. It can be about anything the student wants. One particular week, the underclassmen teacher was out sick so I volunteered to teach the web design project. Two girls, both of which are 14 years old, are having some issues.

G1 = girl number 1

G2 = girl number 2

I just finished the instructions for this part of the project and began walking around assisting where needed.

G1: Excuse me, we can't get the pictures to appear on the page.

Me: Ok, lets take a look. *looks at code* Ok, I see that your code points to a folder on your desktop (they copied the example code I wrote on the whiteboard). Can you both please go to your desktop so I can check the file names?

G1: Whats a desktop?

G2: Yeah, whats a desktop?

Me: *facepalm* Ok, minimize the window you have open.

G2: How do I minimize the window?

Me: *facepalm again* You see the buttons in the top right corner? Click the...

G1: Its asking if I want to save my changes. Do I click no?

Me: Click cancel and then click the left most button in the upper right.

G1: Oh, ok.

Me: This is your desktop. Do you see the folder where you have your pictures?

G2: Whats a folder?

Me: *Gives self concussion from the force of my facepalming, exhales, leans down and notices G2 doesn't have a folder on her desktop* Where have you been putting your pictures for your website?

G2: In Pictures. *opens the pictures folder which indeed contains the photos she wants*

Me: Can you right click on the desktop, click new folder, then rename it to WebPictures with no space (the name I used for the example).

G2: *Does as instructed* Ok, now what?

Me: Ok, move the pictures from Pictures over to your new folder. G1, can you show me your photo that you're trying to add?

G1: *opens Pictures folder instead of desktop folder* Here they are.

Me: No, those should be in the folder on your desktop, you need to move them. 

G1: But they're in my Pictures folder.

Me: They're in your Pictures folder but that is different from the folder you are supposed to be using to store your pictures. You also wrote your code to look at a specific folder on your desktop, not your Pictures folder.

G1: So why can't it just know that my pictures are in Pictures?

Me: You two are a different kind of special. *realizes what I just said out loud*

G1: *looks at G2 with excited eyes and sincerely says* Awwww, he thinks we're special!

Just got a flashback about this one.

I work as a T1 tech at a large IT company. Our company's T1 techs do a lot of things, other T2/T3 companies do such things as creating AD groups, setting up servers and firewalls, and so on. In other words, us T1's know a lot about everything, but still get the shite everyone else gets most of the time.

One client is a government linked client with highly educated people and a caller calls in, about 25 or 27 I think. Lets call her $K.

$Merentis. ""Hi and welcome to $IT company. I'm $Merentis, how can I help?""

$K: ""My browser is not working and I cant upload work documents to $service.""

$Merentis: ""Alright which browser are you using?""

$K: ""What's a browser?"" (slightly annoyed)

$Merentis: ""It's the program you use to access $service and $time report and the one you submit $tickets to.""

$K: ""I went to $uni and studied economics for 5 years! WHY SHOULD I KNOW WHAT A BROWSER IS?! I KNOW HOW COMPUTERS WORK AND BROWSER IS NOT SOMETHING WE USE!""

$Merentis, now tired of this shit: ""Miss, give me your team viewer ID and password and I'll take a look ""

I remote in, open Chrome and go to $service, ask $K to send a document... and it works.

$Merentis: ""This is the recommended browser, Miss. Browser is what is used for the internet.""

$K: ""Oh, it works! Why did I need to call you?!""

$Merentis: ""I dont know, Miss. Have a wonderful day."" *click*

Cue an angry resolution ticket comment about being unprofessional and using hard terms during the call.

Sent a mail to $Manager with the recording and explanation.

Cue 2 days later and their IT director send me a mail with an apology and confirmation about talking to $K.

A week passes and $K calls in.

$K: ""This shitty $service is not working!""

"Nice guy, awful client.","We  were to transfer 4 domains. 3 were hosted locally and 1 overseas. 3 are now with us. The website for one of them gets redirected to the overseas domain. Later the plan changed to let domain 4 expire and move the website to domain 3 instead of redirect to 4.

We transfer the 3 hosted locally &amp; I spend two days fixing their setups in Outlook. The old man has so many things on his desktop it can't display it all. White background, with white icon backdrops, with white window borders. 

When I made backups from C-Panel to prepare transferring I see he couldn't send mail for days because his mailbox contained 312MB of mail with a limit 250MB. I can't even fathom how the previous hosting company couldn't fix that in 10 minutes or why it was set so low. 

On Thursday I contacted the guy who's hosting the website on domain 4 for them at a 900% markup with a website made in Wordpress. I ask for FTP login, C-Panel login or a download URL for a backup. He sends me an exported .XML file. I contact him on Whatsapp on Friday, tell him I can't use that and he sends me the same file. He's supposed to be the contact person but he doesn't even know whom it's hosted with. (Just Google Whois domain.whatever FFS). I now have to find a way to rebuild the website which should be hosted on domain 3 from a file in a format used by software I've never used.

Today the owner contacts me. Outlook keeps erasing his passwords. Four hours later I have it up &amp; running again. Sometimes Outlook profiles corrupt (doesn't show sent folder using IMAP, error will read something about permission). Turns out if you create a new profile called ""Outlook"" from the Control Panel there's a chance it will mess with the registry and you have to go digging around in it. If you if ever need to do it, name it Outlook-yyyy-mm-dd to save yourself headaches later.

He's polite and very relaxed but seriously, screw this guy.

We Owe Money to WHO!?,"Hi, Long time, no post!

This tale comes hot from the floor and this is mostly a place for me to vent at a colossal F$%#up on my part. All spelling mistakes are my own. So on with the show!

Characters

**Me**: Terribly incompetent Techie

**Rory**: Not their real name, Great guy who taught me how to handle tickets with a customer focus. Has since moved up the ladder

**Bourgie**: Also not real name and not even a reflection of the customer, They're name spelling just makes me think of this. He's the Customer

**Fire-Rep**: Sales person of our company attached to the more major Customers

**Eastern Atlantic**: One of the major financial institutions in the country. Not a real name.

**CC**: Customer Calamity. Or at least they normally are. However this one of the few instances this department was mostly just simply caught in the crossfire.

Other names to be used and discarded on a whim.

It was another day in WFH (work from hell), the skies were Grey, the room was grey and so was my shirt. It is 2 hours from the end of my shift as a L1 at a major World Wide OEM of both Consumer and Enterprise products. It was at this point my dreaded Outlook decided to pop up and tell me that Fire-Rep wanted to speak with me. My reply was simple.

    Hi Fire-Rep
    Unfortunately i cannot speak with you in person but im happy to answer you via messaging. Will that do?

Apparently it was. After the usual perfunctory greetings, we get to the real meat of it all. Apparently a ticket that i had resolved with a refund a few weeks ago had gone a bit awry.

The ticket was relatively simple.  

Two monitors were purchased from a Third Party Reseller and did not meet their needs as the panels were two different hues. Swapping them out by the reseller still resulted in the same issue. So Bourgie (the customer) decided to get a refund as the units were only purchased a few days ago. The reseller refused as there was no technical issue and the monitors were working fine.
Tough Luck.

So Bourgie reached out to us as our name is on the monitor. To his unfortunate luck , he got me. So after quick a verification of pictures and some consultation from the powers that be, we deemed it not technical issue. So i sent Bourgie on his merry way to CC which is more of a death sentence than anything else.
See, i would prefer Microsoft Support than talk to these guys on the phone. **HOWEVER** Bourgie has a surprise for me! He had already walked that treacherous path for days on end and had risen from the ordeal with.....Absolutely nothing. There were no records, no messages or even tickets raised.

Now most of you who have ever dealt with Customer Service on either side of the phone would look at this and be suspicious. Why are there no records of this guy coming to us before hand? So the fact that **I, Myself** would look at that and say, Yeap that seems pretty normal, should speak volumes as to why i call 'CC' the Customer Calamity Department. I figured i should help and got the relevant details. Proof of purchase, who it was from, etc. I told Bourgie that i would send this myself to CC and get them to get going.  


After the call , i got order numbers, Serial numbers and all the other information i got, packaged it up in a handy email and sent it off.   
Two weeks later i got reply that it had been assigned and would be handled.  
Two weeks later after that i saw an email that confirmed that refund would go ahead.  
Great! Not my problem anymore, call Bourgie and tell him whats happened and never think of it again!

Until today.

See what i had **ACTUALLY** done was grab one of the Serial numbers, located its order from my company and verified the original reseller who had an account with us. Then i grabbed the other Serial number and got its respective order number before packing it with the rest of the email i sent to CC.
So it turns out that **other** serial number and order number were linked to Eastern Atlantic. This meant that When CC processed the refund, the Procurement team of Eastern Atlantic suddenly found a mysterious unexplained credit to the value of a monitor from my company. In the middle of **Tax time**.

This is apparently a major no-no especially when you're part of a major financial institution that answer to Government agencies for routine Auditing. As well as Non-Routine auditing due to the largest money laundering Criminal offenses in the country which they were found guilty of. So understandably they were a bit panicky when their account books don't match up for no reason, good or bad.

Upon being informed of potentially losing a massive client, Fire-Rep traced the steps to me and the CC agent. The CC agent reasonably pointed her to me as i was the one who had passed on the information from Bourgie. This resulted in me being grilled as to why i had organized a credit to Eastern Atlantic without speaking to Eastern Atlantic. My counterpoint was that Tech Support cant do that with our tools and has to go to CC. After a bitter, brief back and forth i engaged my Big Guns.  

****Enter The Rory****  
Now Rory is no longer considered as Tech Support. As in he isn't allowed to touch the technical side. His current role is wade into  the middle of giant lakes of bullshit  between our company and our customers and set us both straight. This doesnt mean he lost his tech chops though, he can still troubleshoot with best the L1s can offer. It just means that he can tell either the customer or  our people to backup, F#@$ off and get their S!@# together Just as long as he has the backing of Legal. Rory has Direct line to Legal. Legal also really likes how Rory works **AND**  the results it gets for them.  

Rory directs me to back off and tell them that tech support will look into this and get it sorted. I do so and Fire-Rep is still smouldering (thus the Name).  CC on the other hand has rightfully run for the hills. This may be the only time i can sympathize with them. But there was no time to dwell on this. Rory tells me to get the escalations going on so that he can be officially involved. I then have to get in touch with Bourgie to get a feel for them not getting their credit because as a reminder, its still tax time whilst Rory goes and do a thorough digging. I wish him the best of luck and a giant shovel while i go do what he asks.  

I call Bourgie give him a very brief explanation as to what happening to the credit so that he doesnt get wiser as to whats happened. Bougie takes it like a champion and is happy to wait. Great. I then thank him for his time and go to hang up before i have a thought. It occurs to me that i may have misheard or Bourgie may have misread the serial number of the monitors to me.  
So i ask him  if he still has the monitors.  No he does not, they were picked up by the courier two weeks ago.  

I am now dying inside , but ignoring my imminent death, i go on to say good bye to message Rory.  
&gt;**Me**: RORY! MASSIVE PROBLEM!!!  
**Rory**: Hey , Talking_wall i was just about to ask if you could verify the serial numbers of the monitors, i think there may been a mistake somewhere.  
**Me**:About that. the monitors were taken two weeks ago.  
**Rory**:...  
**Rory**: F@#$..........  

This means we have no idea where that monitor is. So we cant even verify if the serial is wrong. Since its with the courier we cant even get them to drop it off somewhere  for us to check. The Collections team cant do it because all they do is **REMOVE** Serial numbers that are no longer in active service for things like... Refunds.  So that's a dead end

So what happens next? No idea. Rory told me that he will have to speak to Legal as Atlantic may take us to court if the Government raises any penalties. We may also lose contracts worth literal billions. This is due to one man wanting a refund of a couple hundred dollars and a techie who got too complacent check the numbers.  

Rory told me he would jump on this first thing the following morning. Now he really wants that shovel for digging, but i dont think its for information anymore....

The doctor who delivered my babies to the wrong homes.,"Just happened today, and thought I’d share. 

I am an independent IT contractor. Self-employed, so no help desks, no change boards, and no ticketing system, although today has made me very seriously consider adding one...

Last night, I got a message from a client. Their internet wasn’t working. I’ve configured their WiFi system and VPN services, so they typically call me if there’s an issue. They also do so, because this is an Obstetricians office, and I was able to determine that their sonogram machine had been causing their WiFi to cut out due to heavy interference. I recommended shielding the room, and things have worked flawlessly, till last night. 

**Office manager**: “Guardian1030, we are having issues with the router. The modem states that it is connected, but the router is not showing up when we try to connect at the office.”

Yeah, they’re those kinda of people. Knowledgeable enough to be dangerous. 

**Me**: “Hey, yeah, I can’t either. They probably need to be power cycled, turned off and back on again.”

**Office manager**: “**The Doctor** just did that while we are on the phone. not making any changes.  I might have to go up.”

So, I try to ping the modem. All dropped. Oh, ok, ISP issue then. I let them know. 

**Me**: “I can’t ping the Spectrum router. Looks like it may be them? Try rebooting their modem again if you haven’t. If I can’t even ping the static IP, it’s likely their hardware.”

**Office manager**: “ok, I had him reset twice already.  I have to run up tonight and will give them a call. We can see the network on the local computers, so this sounds about right.”

I think we’re done, so I go about my business. Then, at 10:39pm...

**Office manager**: “Having serious connectivity issues. They had to reset the modem, removing the stati settings. Now the Obis (he meant Orbis. I installed a mesh WiFi system there) will not communicate. I can get connection from the direct connects. But no WiFi. I have restarted and synced more times than I can count. 

I sent an email. Something is wrong with the Orbis system. I set up a WiFi broadcast point from the sono computer since it is hardwired. I will be in here in the early am to assist. They will have basic functionality until the system is back up.

I need to have access to the orbis as I wasted 4 hours trying to trouble shoot.  I can use the hub to access internet, but satellites are intermittent.“

The email:

**Office manager**: “Guardian1030, 

I reset the modem with the help of Spectrum, it took us about 1-2 hours to get that figured out. I have internet through the lan connection, but no consistent wifi. I have spent the last 2-3 hours trying to figure out the reason why we do not have connection at the satellites and intermittent connection at the Main / hub Orbi. I went through all the trouble shooting, but do not have access to the orbis’ diagnostics in the app. I am going to hac the back computer to allow internet to all the other computers via bluetooth until something can be done. They need internet in the am and this is the only solution that I can come up with. I have reset the devices, the computers, updated the connections on each and this is all I have. They will not have printing capabilities via wifi, just on the hardwired printers up front. 


I will be up at 6 so that I can come up and help. “

I woke up at 6:30, read this, got dressed, and headed out. 

I get there at 7, and get to work. I assessed the damage, figured out that they had in fact completely drugged it up. SNAFU was appropriate. My static network had been double NAT’d, WAN dhcp assigned, double dhcp LAN, and two separate subnets. I check for **Office manager**, and he’s not there... doesn’t show up till 8:30...

After 2 hours of assessment and a conversation with an AMAZING rep from spectrum, I had things back to the normal (or so I thought) of the initializing incident. The spectrum box wasn’t passing internet through when configured for a static IP. It was 9:30. We scheduled for someone to come out and swap it for us. Of course, it was sometime between 11-12, which was a big improvement because I stressed it was a medical office. 

10:30, and the tech arrives. Unreal. We get to work. He get the new box installed and starts configuring it. This guy is great. I’d worked with him before on another client and I knew he knew his chops. The router is installed and finally starts pinging. 

But... still no internet. Exasperated, I decide to check the cables. I mean, check if it’s plugged in, right? So, I look at my router, and I notice that the cables are all in, and I look to make sure the spectrum modem is plugged in to the WAN port. Hey... where’s the yellow WAN port? I pick up the “router” and read the bottom...

...

...

*Satellite*

...

I set it down. Storm out of the server closet, and start looking through the office. I find the router, swap the units, storm back to the server closet and install the router where the router should be. Magic. The network comes to life. Everything works again. 

When the internet went down due to the spectrum modem failing, **the Dr.** swapped the boxes around. I don’t know why... maybe they thought rearranging my networking equipment would fix it? Maybe swapping boxes around would make it work better like rabbit ears on an old TV? In his exceptionally meager defense, they look identical from the front. The router says “Router” on the bottom and has a yellow WAN port. He put the satellite in its place. 

Spectrum box died, they decided to handle it themselves and reassembled the system incorrectly. 

I fixed it. And I am *relishing* the descriptive bill I’m going to send them.




**EDIT Here's the text from the invoice...**




* 7:00a-9:30a
    * Arrive on site and begin assessing the network.
    * Determine that the Spectrum Router had been reconfigured to DHCP -Dynamic Hostname Configuration Protocol- mode both on the WAN -Wide Area Network- and the LAN -Local Area Network- instead of being configured for a Static Passthrough, the modem had been configured in router mode, and was also attempting to direct network traffic instead of the Orbi router, which was also still on the network somewhere. Assess that the network subnet had changed with the Spectrum Modem now in Router mode, and not all devices were connected to the new subnet. Attempt to access the network, and was able to successfully log in to the router configuration page. Determine that in addition to the reconfiguration of the networking protocols, the default device username and password had also been changed to something easily searchable on the internet.
    * Call Spectrum Customer Support and begin working with a tech to change things back to the way they're supposed to be. Determine that the assigned Static IP information for the account hadn't been changed, only the device configuration. Work with the tech to return the Spectrum Modem to the previous configuration. After several attempts, determine that the modem had failed, and cannot accept the configuration anymore, so it will need replacement. Schedule a call to Spectrum dispatch.


* 9:30a-11:00a
    * take a break and go off-site to grab the breakfast I'd missed


* 11:00a-12:15p 
    * Meet with the Spectrum Tech and discuss what's happened/happening. Determine that the box definitively needed a replacement as we could even hear the logic board onsite rattle when the device was moved. 
    * Replace the Modem and reconfigure with the appropriate settings. Test several configurations, and finally get the mode accessible from the Internet on the correct Static IP address. 
    * Examine the network and determine that there is still no internet access through the office via WiFi. 
    * Check the cables in the Orbi router in the server closet, determine that they are all plugged in. Note the lack of a yellow labeled WAN port. Examine the bottom of the Orbi router and determine that it is not a router, but is one of the satellite devices. 
    * Check the office for where the actual Orbi router was and determine that it had been moved into the nurses station. Remove the router and reinstall in the server closet between the Spectrum Modem and the LAN so that it can accept and filter the traffic from the internet and Spectrum Modem, provide Firewall security for the entire network, allow for Port Forwarding to the VPN server, provide appropriate DHCP routing for all devices to begin cooperatively working on the network again and communicating with each other, and generate the initial WiFi network that communicates with and is extend by the satellite devices. 
    * Reinstall the satellite device from the server closet at the nurses station to make sure the WiFI was extended to the front office computers for intaking patients.
    * Check with the staff to make sure that the network was working throughout the building, reconfigure a few printers, check for any additional staff members and determine they'd all gone to lunch.",1125,0,1
A good boss brings tacos,"So this is ongoing.  My honcho bought a new laptop and wanted me to set it up.. cool.  But nearly the same day his old one would reboot and do disk repair and then run like crap.. probably the HD is dying.  So today it's way after hours and he brings the old one and new one over to my house and I start trying to grab all his data off the old one .. using ol magwiz from an external hd .. shit still works even in win10

It's taking FOREVER... he's like well I need it all my stuff tomorrow morning .. i'm like well.. look at the progress bar.. it's going to be a while (what should have been maybe 20 minsr for 40 gigs was taking a lot longer probably due to a faulty HD.. but it was still going).  He gets frustrated.. it's about 8:00 at night and he's at my house.

I'm like .. i'll text you when the transfer is done and then I can move it all to your new comp and get all the other applications set up (which i'm also doing meanwhile).  Boss is ok.. well.. the wife and kids need me for dinner i'll be back.

SO eventually I get those data off and copy his firefox/chrome profiles over so he never has to remember any passwords (this is key).. magwiz is running and I text him he can take the old comp home.. and maybe use it for another day if he's lucky till the new one is ready (it's doing windows updates like a MOFO etc)

Boss shows up with a giant plate of home made pulled pork tacos and six pack of IPA.. He's like thanks a lot for doing this..

I'm like TACOS! BEER!

GOOD BOSS GOOD!

so new laptop should be ready to go by tomorrow morning but shit like this really motivates a person to get the job done huh?

Where is the password? Or when Security goes wrong.,"Today dear readers, I come to you with a cautionary tale.

Up until May this year, I was employed by a Point-of-Sale IT company. The vast majority of our clients were resturant chains. So when the world turned upside down, they all closed. When they closed, they stopped paying for services we weren't rendering. This resulted in furloughs. Each department had to make cuts and I drew the short straw. When matters didn't improve in a timely fashion, those furloughs became terminations. Seven of our clients left our serivces entirely, making for a huge loss in revenue. 200 employees were let go, myself included. 

Now before we get to that, I should point out part of what I did for the company. I was part of the senior development and support team. Each of us was a master of one aspect of the services and products we offered. 

One of our clients was notorious for attempting to cut out the middle man. When they first signed on with us, the contract had us doing everything, down to assisting their managers with HR concerns, on boarding, and just about everything. We even were in charge of submitting facilities requests. A clogged toilet started with a call to us, which we then routed to the local facilities provider for the resturant, all while maintaining the guise that we were all a part of the client's internal structure. Anyone the manager may have to talk to was contractually obligated to call themselves ""Client Services - Department X"" to maintain this illusion.

But the secret was quickly revealed after the contract came up for renewal. The client was paying a hefty sum for this white glove treatment. And when it came time to renew the contract, they had different plans. A full third of the services we provided were no longer required. They had watched us do these things, and trained an internal staff to do them instead. A third of our serivices were gone, and with it, a third of our fees. This was the first half of the proverbial straw. The second was an app. The company was converting old stores from an antiquated POS software to a new one. They were different brands and not at all compatible. Understandably, they wanted all sites to use the same system. And there was the problem. The employees in the old system had to be entered by hand into the new one. This was time consuming and prone to errors. So they wanted a tool to do it automatically. They provided us with a lab, or a fake set of stores on their network to test in. The prototype was developed and demonstrated. The app pulled employee data from the old system, stored it briefly, then fed it into the new system, and finally cleaned up after itself. 

Suddenly, they backed out. They paid for the labor to produce the prototype, but didn't pay for the project to use it and convert the stores. 

A week later we found on a converted store a program with their logo on it. Inside, I found they had taken the code from the prototype, moved it around, changed variable names, added a bunch of nonsense comments, and then slapped their own trademark on it. Management was pissed. We still had a contract with them for another project in the works: upgrading them to windows 10. This also called for specialized tools we would code and deploy. The tool would handle all the myriad of installations and joinings and importing and exporting and such. Place it on the old computer,, and get a folder. Place the folder and app on the new computer,, and get a fully upgraded site. It took hours to run, but made the job as easy as monitoring a progress bar. The bosses didn't want another incident, and called a meeting with my team. They asked if it was possible to put a password on the tools so that only we could use them, but have it be done so that even if they looked at the code, they couldn't get the password. 

I said it was possible, but would take some time and research on my part. And here is where the ball started to roll downhill. 

I designed a simple password system that involved hashing, and then a Google 2FA token. The password would be salted, hashed, put through a few rounds of Salsa20, then salted and hashed again. The result was held in memory, then the process was repeated a few times more. The end result was compared to a stored value, and a failure would reject the password. The second value we held back earlier, was used as the seed for a Google authenticator. , which I and two other high level techs had on our phones. Password plus authenticator got you in. The same authenticator seed was then used to cover up some critical lines in the code. Proper authentication uncovered them, and the program could run. It was a kludge and a half, held together with nothing more than ductape and righteous thoughts. 

Anyone with a compsci degree, math degree, and either a lot of computing power or a lot of patience, would be able to Crack the whole thing wide open. But it was immune to casual snooping.

A week into the upgrade project, the client asks for the password to the tools, and is told that since the tools are only on their machines during the upgrade project and are removed afterwords, there was no need for them to have the password. Of course, we would gladly provide them with a passwordless version for our usual development fees. They elected to allow us to just handle matters. 

Now here comes the hammer fall. 

Pandemic, closures, furloughs, and finally, terminations. 

No one at the administrative level thought to check what my colleagues and I were assigned to when the straws were drawn. All three techs with the google authenticator password were let go on the same day. Per corporate policy, our company phones were remotely wiped an hour before we were told of our terminations. 

The night after my termination, I got a call from the tech who took over my job of doing the upgrades to asked for the password which I freely gave. The Google code however, I didn't have. Half an hour later I am on the phone with a very pissed off Director of support. Who can't understand why I can't just give him the password. I explain the whole process in detail, and he demands that I rebuild the google string. I, still pissed about my termination, say I will gladly do so once I am paid for my services. He didn't like this answer and hung up. 

From my coworkers, I learned that he gave my work computer to one of the few senior support analysts that remained, and just told them to get it working. In truth, anyone with a compsci degree and a little patience could have recovered the seed using the code in the program, but everyone with that knowhow was fired. 

Eventually, the bosses decreed that the project would continue with all 50+ steps being done by hand. Now instead of three agents watching four sites each for two hours, they each worked on one site at a time for four hours a piece. 

The project went way past the specified completion date, and the client basically got the job done for close to free. Mishandling of data by the analysts led to loss of employee information and worse, credit-card and bank account information, which all turned to losses on the client's part. Of course they turned around and demanded further compensation.

Two months later, I got a call from HR, offering me a job doing the same work, at a 30% paycut and a position two steps below the one I left as. They also reminded me that my refusal would be reported to unemployment. I laughed as I hung up the phone.

I have been mean spirited in this story, but nobody won here. My company and the client suffered, I suffered, and my replacements suffered. Everyone lost. Even if I had the last laugh, it felt a little hollow to me. 

TLDR: bosses demand super secure program be made. They fire me, then later complain the program is too secure. Demand I break into it for free. 

if a password is important, write it down and keep it in a safe. If an employee is essential, either don't lay them off or make sure you can live without them. And most importantly, if you want someone to help you, don't ask by insulting them. Security is nice, but oversecurity can bite you.",1205,0,1

$bossman = my boss

$user = one very quizzical end user. I seem to get those. 


Was working at a small MSP at the time $user calls 

$user: hey MSP we can't reach the shares.

$bossman: $kokoroutasan, I can't hit the server, you're closest can you head out there. 

$kokoroutasan: sure, I gotchyu. *heads out for the drive, arrives, peeks in the server room which was really a closet with a small 1u hung in a box up on the wall* hey, uh $bossman, it's got lights on it. Little error triangle is lit up too.... we don't have a monitor in here....

$bossman: find something

$kokoroutasan: hey, uh $user, you said you were about to head to lunch? Can I borrow your monitor? And keyboard? 

$user: uh... what? Surrrrrre.

$kokoroutasan: *completely disassembles $users stuff and drags it in precariously balancing the monitor on a printer while standing on a chair to reach the server* yeah, uh $bossman, looks like it hit some error in the bios on a reboot and never booted. I'm gonna bounce it. *bounces server and babysits, #viewingpaneOS boots up* 

$user: *returns and peeks in*

$kokoroutasan: thank you so much, we are good I'm about to get you hooked back up here, uh when someone decides to get a new monitor can we stick their old one in here somewhere?

Story two:

Of users changing modems without telling IT.

$bossman = boss

$apologetic = the user who tried to make less work, and accidentally made more. 

$bossman: hey $kokoroutasan #client called their internet's down. Turns out they decided to have #ISP replace their modem without telling us. I *think* we just need to reboot the firewall, can you drive down? 

$kokoroutasan: that's a long drive to push a button if you're right. They understand how our onsite rate works? 

$bossman: yep, you're good. Would rather have someone already there if that doesn't fix it. They've already canceled all their clients for the afternoon. Oh also, bring a ladder with you.... they had some rickety wooden thing last I was there. It's up on a high shelf. 

$kokoroutasan: got it *drives an hour in total befuddlement and arrives onsite*

$apologetic: oh my goodness, thank you for being here! I hope you are able to get us back up, we are so sorry and didn't know this would cause an issue. We didn't want to disturb you just for swapping one thing. 

$kokoroutasan: no worries, I'll take a look here *traces writes all correct, describes lights to $bossman$*

$bossman: yeah let's bounce the firewall. Just hold the power button

$angryconfused: the user who reacts to every inconvenience in anger

$contractor:  random guy onsite doing maintenance 


$kokoroutasan: look, $toosmart, I know you want to finish this network share revamp today. But that dept head is out due that last group. I really don't recommend moving that depts files without them knowing. It's going to cause an issue. The dept head needs to do this when they return

$toosmart: I understand. Really I do

$kokoroutasan: *goes back to my office to work on tickets, gets about 10 mins of quiet*

$clientboss: $toosmart!!! $kokoroutasan!!! Get in here now!!

$kokoroutasan: *queue internal customer service panic*

$clientboss: where the f*ck are $angryconfused's files!? He just called me threatening to quit! All his stuffs been deleted. 

$kokoroutasan: I don't know what you are talking about, we weren't touching any of that groups files their dept head is out. May I look please?  *internal f%ck sh&amp;t f%ck and looks* I see them, they got moved to New folder early. He's got the old stuff mapped, I'll go help him out.

$clientboss: how the f*ck did this happen!?

$kokoroutasan:  I don't know. I didn't touch it I was waiting, please let me go help him get back up

$toosmart: I moved them,  I didn't think anyone would notice. 

$clientboss: *kicks me out of his office and starts yelling at $toosmart*

$contractor:  *walks by scared* uh.... that knife got packed right? 

$kokoroutasan:  that what? 

$contractor: oh earlier he was mad at one of my colleagues, had a random carving knife in the table in his office and kept waving it randomly for emphasis

$kokoroutasan:  oh uh uh..... *goes to office calls $hr* what the flying f*ck? This is ridiculous, $toosmart broke stuff, $clientboss is screaming at me, he was apparently waving a knife earlier at others.....

$hr: can you help $angryconfused then leave for the day? 

$kokoroutasan: yeah.... sure....

*goes to $angryconfused's office.  $clientboss is already there*

$clientboss: *starts screaming some more*

$angryconfused: *starts screaming but reluctantly lets me show him where the files are. Decided its not horrible but he's still angry*

$clientboss starts screaming some more at $toosmart who just walled in. But I was accidently standing closer to him so even though he's telling at $toosmart he does so by getting in my face and wagging his finger at me. I walk out. Grab my equipment and leave for the day. 

I end up calling $bossman in tears. I'm scared, I'm hurt, I'm angry. $bossman calls $clientboss and yells at him. Me.... I decided then I was finishing my degree so I could get out. Still had to go to that client more, but $bossman was right, $clientboss never raised his voice at me again.",108,0,1

Chrome opens with the accept terms of use thing, like when you start it for the first time.

The USB cable that didn't fit any more...,"This time the user was my mother. My mother is quite tech-savvy, for her age. Her workplace has everyone working remotely since lockdown started and she's using my old bedroom as her home office since it has a large desk. (This will be relevant later.)

Yesterday after work, mum video called me to catch up and show me some photos. Midway through the call I see her fiddling with something so I ask her what's wrong.

Mum: ""I'm trying to charge my phone but the plug won't fit any more. I've been using this cable that I found plugged in the outlet near your desk, so I don't have to go downstairs and get my charger. I used it lots of times and it worked just fine, but now it won't fit!""

At this point I knew what the problem was. I had in my old room a cable with a mini USB plug, that I used to charge my phone when I stayed overnight at my parents'. A few months ago mum's ancient Nokia mobile phone gave up the ghost and I gave her my old smartphone since I'd just upgraded to a newer model. So obviously that USB cable worked just fine for charging mum's phone.

However, my new phone has a USB-C port, and I kept forgetting about it... Until last time I visited I brought a spare USB-C cable and left it in my room so I could charge my phone at my parents'. So my mum was now trying to fit an USB-C plug into a mini USB port.

I tried to tell this (or at least the abridged version) to my mum. I told her: ""That isn't the cable you've been using, that's a different cable that I put there last week. See if you can find the old cable lying around.""

Mum: ""No, no, I've used *this* cable before. The black one plugged next to your desk. It used to work.""

Me: ""That was a different cable... If you look at your phone you'll see that the port has two triangular-like shapes at each end, while the plug of that cable has rounded ends...""

Mum (clearly not listening to a word): ""I dropped the phone the other day, it's still working fine, but maybe it dented somehow and that's why the plug doesn't fit? Although the charger downstairs still works because I used it last night...""

Me: ""Mum, no, there are two different cables, that's not the right cable for your phone!""

Mum: ""Oh, wait, I see another cable on this shelf. Let me try this one. It works! Good, I've solved it! Sorry, what were you saying?""

Me (trying not to laugh): ""Never mind...""

EDIT: Yes, well spotted, micro USB not mini. Although now that I think about it, there's probably also a mini USB cable in the mess that is my old room. Let's hope my mum never finds it.",1223,0,1
A few tales,"I have a few tales. I don't feel like making multiple posts so, bargain deal. I work for a school district and as a result, we have a lot of people who don't really know how to use technology, despite the fact its a main part of the districts learning plan. 

**Story 1**

We had a teacher who somehow still works here bring her laptop in with a wrinkled spot in the back of the monitor and the middle of the LCD being all discolored. She said she didn't know why but the screen was messed up. As soon as I take the laptop I see the mark on the back of the screen. It was melted. I eventually got her to admit she had a lit candle on her table at home and it was behind the computer. 

A few weeks later a random laptop is brought to the High School from a random person. It looks like it had been run over after being thrown out of a car on a highway. I look up who it belongs to and its that same teacher. I check my emails thinking, maybe she told us it went missing over the weekend as I had not gone through all my emails yet. Nothing. I call the school and the secretary says the teacher informed them that last Thursday, its now Monday that the laptop went missing and that the teacher was going to inform us. The person who found it, found it during the weekend. She had no idea how it went missing, she left it in the school, etc. So.... to find out what happened, I check the cameras for that Thursday. I see her car. Laptop on the trunk as she backs up, stops and laptop falls off.... and she backs up over it, then drives over it going forward again to just leave. Laptop still on the ground. 

As bad as it is, I give it power and it turns right on, for whatever reason skips the login screen, logs her right in and I see tabs open on Chrome.... for her work and personal email and bank.... all passwords saved. I didn't care to look into it but my guess is, someone get their hands on it, installed a password bypass and accessed all her stuff. Not my problem as the average domain user has no real network authority. I show her and the principal the footage.... she says she didn't realize it. SOMEHOW... she didn't hear it fall... feel or hear it get run over, twice.... I was told to get her a replacement laptop. She got the worse laptop we had. Im talking it had an old Intel Dual core, 120GB HDD, 2gb Ram, Windows Vista laptop. Oh yes.... Vista. Literally the only laptop in the district with it. I know... some may say its mean, she had a job to do... However, the laptop she destroyed cost about $550 to replace... and cost about $100 to fix the first time so... $650 was already spent due to her negligence. She was informed if that got broken or ""stolen"" she would get a desktop computer that couldn't move. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Story 2...ish. Trouble Tickets**

We have a trouble ticket system that uses a google form. Idiot proof.... or should be mostly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ticket says ""Screen is not Cracked but has lines"".... The cracks are clear as day and form an X in the middle of the screen

&amp;#x200B;

Someone said they shook the toner cartridge and we need to fix it.... Ominous. I go there and there is toner.... everywhere. They got mad when I noped the fuck out of there and told them to call the custodians first. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ticket system says "" 

Please be sure to give your actual room number and NOT a room name or description (ie ""H211A"" NOT ""IT Office"")

Please tell us your room number only.""

Person replies with... ""my room"".... 

&amp;#x200B;

**Story 3, I don't drink coffee**

Got a call that a laptop would not turn on. They say its plugged in, etc. They dont know what happened, it was working and then shut off. Told them not to touch anything and I would be right there. I look at the keyboard and immediately see its been wiped down. I pick up the laptop and a pool of coffee is under the laptop. I ask them if they spilled coffee. They said ""I don't even drink coffee"".... 2 feet away was a Starbucks cup with their name written on it that looked like it had coffee all over the side of the cup. I just look at the cup, then to their face and just look at them ""emotionless"".... The class is laughing because they all know what happens. A kid pipes up in the back mocking ""oh shit, my coffee"" another kid calls her out saying something like ""you literally just spilled it on the computer""....

"The ""smiley thing""","Ok, so let set the time period first. This happened in the mid-’90s, the internet was still dial-up and PC’s in the home was a rare thing. So a little forgiveness has to be given. Not just for the person involved, but for my full memory of it.

At this point in the story, I had been part of developing a management system for a large (you know them) chain of fast food restraints. As the project when further on, and the team started to shrink during roll-out, I’d been put in as the team lead on the project. I’d worked on almost all of the modules involved at some point during development, so had a great understanding of the project, I also had the mindset that when one of the customers' managers would randomly pull out and start playing butterfly knife during meetings I found more hilarious than intimidating.

One of the downsides of this new position was that I was also assigned as the 3rd line support for the product. This was no big problem, it would be once every 2-3 weeks before I was called in, the customer had a great IT team. So very little came our way.

Around 4 pm on a winter night, sat in the office I get the call. The assistant manager as the XXX branch is having problems with this system, we can’t work out what the problem is. Can you help?

So I call the branch, get hold this assistant manager, and ask the problem. And this is where I ask forgiveness of this person. For most people at the time using a PC was like jumping into alien technology without Jeff Goldblum. He had no idea how to explain what was happening... But he kept mentioning the “smiley thing” and with 20/20 hindsight I should have asked sooner.

I lost track of time with this call, by this point it was already 10-15 minutes long, a random flow on unconnected words that only vaguely described the software and the problem he was having. The one thing I did notice was the room I was sat in, with around 25 other developers had gone completely silent as everyone listened into what has happening.

Finally, I jumped in and asked what “smiley thing” was? Over the next few excruciating sentences, I was finally able to advise the manager, that it was actually called... “a mouse.”

This now clear, I realised that the ball mouse had become gunked up and needed cleaning. I ended the call with the promises to raise a support ticket to the clients IT team.

I hung up to applause and laugher from the team sat around me.

In my 30+ years in development, I’ve had to deal with things like hundreds of 13-year-old online gamers calling for my death on a daily basis. That was easy compared to this one phone call.

A cherish the fact than even you’re Nan knows what a mouse is today.",123,0,1
Take the Rubber Mallet,"So I am not a 100% that this fits, if not please feel free to redirect

TL;DR Rubber Mallet beats expensive door

Oblig. Formatting on mobile and English ain't my mother tongue. Also I suck writing on mobile. 

My Hubby works as a System Admin but this particular story did not actually challenge his technical expertise so much as his sanity and common sense...

For Context he is working at a company that acts as a service provider for other bigger businesses who don't want to pay their own IT or who's own IT is specialised in certain  fields only.

His Boss is one of those people who promise everything and their uncle to the customer and _afterwards_ ask if what he promised is actually, ya know, _available_ 

For a while he got it into his head to sell IT telephones, and everything that could possibly entail. My Hubby, then still a trainee, got two days of prep and was from that day on the 'Expert' on everything Telephone.  I could go on and on how _nothing_ ever worked with telephones, how the customers never had any systems that were in anyway compatible with whatever IT Phone they had bought, how the sales people sold things they didn't have, how one of the Customers is still waiting for completion, a 3/4 Year later... it was an utter disaster.

Anyway, one of the things in tandem with the phones were electronic door openers which could be used via the IT Phone to buzz people in. One Customer wanted the whole brand new office they were just finishing equipt with that.

So, my Hubby packs in all the electronic door keys that are supposed to go into the doors to make them tick and drives of. Once there, he has a floor plan and starts with the first door. He tries to put the Cylinder through the latch into the hole meant for exactly that.  It goes in halfway and no further. He twist, he turns, no dice. When he takes the Cylinder out again to see if something might be in there to block it, he realizes that the hole itself is completely twisted. It skews upward so that he can only see a sliver of light on the other side. Needless to say, ain't no cylinder going in there. 

Well, he thinks, one bad door, I'll write it down and I'll probably have to come back once more, bummer.

In the end he gets one of 12 Cylinder in. None of the doors fit. Whoever build the doors has screwed up royally. Hubby drives back to the Company with fotos and the rest of the devices and tells his boss. His answer? ""No, I'm sure those fit. Next time you'll just take my rubber mallet and hammer those things in.""

Hubby politely declined, reasoning  that that was _insane_ and would most definitely _not_ make the situation better. 

That was a Friday, on Monday he had to go into his trade school. On Tuesday he comes back to see one of his colleagues filling out a compensation claim from the customer. 

Colleague wasn't as brave in standing up to his boss as hubby had been and actually took the rubber mallet. The first door he tried this foolproof method on was the Door of the Customers Boss, nice wood, with an inlaid plaque. Now it was all that but with a nice chunk missing where the Mallet had struck.

Long story short Hubby's Boss decided to discontinue Phone service.

SS: (immediately) The cable is connected

Me: That is strange... (bangs some keys just to make a noise) i can't find that POS, can you do me a favor and check what color the cable is so i know where to find that pos? (yeah as if we care about the color)

SS: just a moment... (noises, huffs and puffs for some 2-3 minutes while they remove the usual crap they put over the ever overheating POS)

Client learns the difference between websites and magazines the hard way.,"I used to build websites for small charities. Mostly they were lovely to work with, but occasionally I had problems due to the fact their tech knowledge tended to be non-existent. 

I’d just finished a site for a charity that raised money for their local hospital, and was quite pleased how it came out. I’d enjoyed building the thing and got on well with their volunteers, including the chief exec. 

Soon after sending them the test environment url for them to proof the site before going live, I got a call from the chief exec. Instead of the ‘nice job, it looks great’ conversation I’d been expecting, she was in a furious rage. 

‘How could you deliver such a shoddy piece of work! Nothing looks like it’s supposed to! It’s so unprofessional, I can’t believe it!’ It’s just completely broken!’

Oh no I’ve screwed up, I think, and frantically load up the site. It looks fine. 

‘Uh, it looks okay to me’, I say. ‘What seems to be the problem?’

This led to a much longer rant about how I’d tricked them and had no intention of delivering a working site. 

Determined to get to the bottom of the problem, I apologised profusely and asked her to click on the homepage link so that we were on the same page and she could start to describe the problem. 

‘I can’t do that’, she said, ‘it won’t work’. 

‘Okay, what computer are you using? Maybe it’s your browser version?’

‘Oh no dear, I don’t have a computer. Nasty things, won’t have them in the house.’

At this point my brain nearly broke from the force of the sudden mental gear change. 

It turned out that she was the sort of chief exec who had her assistant print out her emails in the morning and then dictated replies for the poor person to type up. She’d had the entire site printed out and was upset it looked wrong.",2985,0,1
Another tale of Excel Autoformatting Woes,"A story was posted a bit ago about someone who had issues caused by excel so I thought I'd share one.  This isn't strictly end user tech support but more tech support dealing with a vendor during an environment migration.

We were getting a csv from the vendor that needed to be loaded into the new system with some basic information that included long numbers(some with leading zeros that had to be preserved).  During UAT testing the target system blew up because well it ended up with scientific notation numbers in it.  After many hours of troubleshooting with the entire team on stand by on a weekend turns out someone had opened the csv in excel to ""validate it"" and saved it instead of just closing it.  

Well shockingly this happened again in dress rehearsal, fortunately there was less troubleshooting as the problem was known.  By production time there was a step in the process that basically said  Make sure &lt;explitive of choice&gt; document was not saved in excel.",195,0,1
It would have been better to give up the $1.5 million grant than work with this person.,"Abandon all hope of a happy ending or witty revenge all ye who proceed onward because this story does not end well.

While writing this post I realize it is WAY to long to encompass every horrible thing that happened at this job, so I'll just write about how our project survived a visit from HRSA.

The players in this tale of woe are:

Me: Young nieve web designer who recently moved into the state and is desperate to start his career.

AB: Awesome Boss

TC: The Crew of awesome coworkers. Grant coordinator + secretary

DQ: Data Quantifier who quantifies data so HRSA knows the project is on track.

HRSA: HRSA, scary people who gave us the grant.

OD: The Office Dragon who drove our project into the ground.

Several years ago I picked up work as Lead Tech for a grant project sending nursing students to the homes of elderly refugees. Refugees get free medical screening and taught how to use their medications, students get training in caring for the elderly. 

It was a small group of people with lofty ideals trying to accomplish a task no one else had attempted in the USA at the time. There were no models to base our project off of and so we had to make it all from scratch. 

My job was to put together a data collection app the students could use for medical screenings and make it easy to quantify the data to prove that we benefited both the students and refugees.

As AB once told me 'she didn't care how it got done as long as it got done,' and I was determined enough to make sure it did.

It was hard but rewarding both emotionally and mentally. The project was a huge success and helped a good number of refugees in the area. This honestly was my favorite job for the first year and a half. 

And then came the dark times.

Then came... The Office Dragon.

OD was our Grant Writer and she came with... baggage. She burned all her bridges at the university. OD was actually Dean of the university at one point... until she was removed... and put into a department all by herself because they couldn't fire her. I only thought this happened in movies, but no, this was a real thing. Someone once told AB that it would be better to give up the 1.5 million dollar grant than to work with this person. Word. For. Word.

She also lived in a completely different city and had to Zoom into our meetings before 2020 made that cool.

But she was the only one available to write the grant and this was a 'do it now or never' kind of project. 

Sadly, AB passed away from illness halfway through the project. The very next day OD jumped more than 10 department heads to take control of the project. 

Before, the OD was merely a nuisance, mostly because of old grudges they had against her. Department heads suddenly turning hostile when they heard OD's name and making sure paperwork we needed from them got to us slower... things like that.

But now, \*insert crazy laugh\* OD was our pointed hair boss with zero skills in leadership and was quick to throw us under the bus at the first sign of trouble. She started butting heads with The Crew, mostly our grant coordinator, the person who fielded calls to refugee organizations, scheduled nurses for onsite and basically the heart, soul, spine and left kidney of the project. 

It got so bad that they had to hire another worker just to mediate between them, who eventually took over the job when the coordinator quit rather than deal with OD anymore.

That was after the visit from HRSA.

In the summer of 2017, the project got torpedoed by several problems. Without going into the politics of it, the government became very hostile to immigrants, particularly refugees. Powers-that-be shut down several of the organizations that supplied us with patients, effectively gutting our project. 

Also, the QB was having... problems sending in our data to HRSA. which is a story for another time. Suffice to say that we didn't get our reports in on time during a very hostile climate.

To top it all off, I had not actually talked to our new boss in... oh... months. Remember how I said she Zoomed into our meetings? Eventually, our weekly team meeting became monthly, and even then she never showed up (probably for how she was butting heads with everyone on the project)

At that point, I was rather fed up with her as well. I had spent the last year building a web site for the project, the one thing I'm actually trained to do, and I had submitted the draft for her approval. All she had to do was say 'yay' or 'nay, do this better' on it and it was done.

She decided to cancel the website, deciding it was not needed to have a virtual face to the project.

Given the time and effort I put into, needless to say, I was ok with not talking to my boss for a while.

Things were a mess. So HRSA was going to come here and get us back on track.

The office ... freaked... out.

Imagine that scene from The Return of the Jedi with Darth Vader berating the officer for not building the Death Star fast enough. 

""But sir! We need more men!""

""Then you can tell it to HRSA. You will find they are not as forgiving as I am.""

""H-HRSA?! They are coming here? We will double our efforts!""

Yeah, it was like that. We were all joking we would be visited by James bond and government spies and other action movie people. So to our surprise, the day HRSA arrived, they simply 'appeared' in the office room we scheduled to meet them in WITHOUT US KNOWING ABOUT IT.

Probably took a side entrance we were not expecting but I like to imagine they dropped in from the skylight. Either way, the day didn't go well. HRSA was there to ask us all sorts of questions about why their money wasn't being spent the way they wanted. So naturally, OD locked us out of the meeting mostly to make sure we didn't point out the source of all our problems, that is, to point at OD and her refusal to take any leadership what so ever. She was, of course, quick to take all the credit of our work.

I should point out that the second-day HRSA was there, the HRSA medical officer came dressed in her military uniform. There are few things I have seen less terrifying than a woman in full military uniform who has traveled over 2000 miles from Washington D.C. to get your project back on track.

Suffice to say, our project survived HRSA day despite OD's apparent efforts to drive it into the ground.  Even without her interference, we were plagued by other issues. HRSA wanted to accompany our students on one of their onsites but the translator (there to translate between refugees and students) had a medical emergency that day, forcing us to hire a phone-based translating service.... who also had a medical emergency that day.

Thankfully the medical officer above knew the language and was able to translate. When HRSA got back they were... actually excited. They didn't just get to watch but got to participate and they were ecstatic about it. Honestly, it probably saved our project.

...That time. 

How the project ended, the other things OD did to me, and the crew will have to be saved for other stories. I've already spent a few hours writing this one out. It feels good to finally put them... somewhere. Hopefully, this will bring closure to one of the most horrible jobs I had to work with and of course, entertain readers.",166,0,1
Can I move a phone?,"I am internal desktop support for a local ISP.  A few days ago I got an email from an employee asking if he could move an IP phone.

Edit--
This is at an offsite retail location.  User (the manager) doesn't have access to the network closet. 
End edit

&amp;#x200B;

User: Can I move a wired phone from jack 15 to jack 11 at location X?

Me:   You can but it won’t work.  I've removed patch cables from  all unused ports and disabled them in the switch.  I’ve done this at all locations.  Security reasons.  Keeps someone from just plugging a device into a jack somewhere and get access to our network.

I would have to run a new patch cable to the switch for that jack.  Then I would enable the port on the switch.

User:   Is that a doable?

Me:   Sure.  Is this something mission critical that has to be done today?

User:   No, it’s not critical.  Where I’m sitting doesn’t have a phone.  Should I wait to move the phone?

Me:   Up to you.  But again if you move it then it won’t work.  I’d wait if it was me.

User:   Perfect.  Let me know when you have time.",1057,0,1
Difference between period and the (.) period,"I had a user call in from California and she was unable to log into the domain on her computer.  I then told her the “simple steps” on how she needed to sign into our local account and gave her the username and password.  Unfortunately, English was not her first language. I then proceeded to tell her to type in xxxx.xx. 

Me. “Please put in xxxx.xx “ 

User. “ period?”

Me. Yes the key that’s on the bottom of the keyboard”

User “keyboard?”

Me. “Yes the thing you type on there should be a period key” 

User “ ohh type in period?”

Me “ no, hit that key for me “


 Needless to say this goes on for 30 -45 minutes and had to bring in her husband to translate for her who again. English, not first language.   my wife is cracking up in the other room and I end up telling her she needs to go into the office and connect to the network",343,0,1
"Customer pounds on door, leaves, then Lies about being still there when they were skipped for no longer being preset.","So with the Coronavirus going on we have a system where we lock the door between customers, with a ticket dispenser outside the door with several signs saying ""pull a number and wait to be called""   
Some people wait in their cars, some people wait by the door.  
Some people keep trying to pull on the door after taking a ticket because they are confused about how a ticket system works, even though there are signs still there.  


But every once in a while we get a special customer that is some completely impatient, that they will take a ticket and then when the door doesn't magically unlock will start full on pounding on the door when no one immediately comes to assist them, and by the time we are ready to bring in the next customer, they leave. (in most cases these customers are also the next one to be served, this customer was infact the next one to be served)  


So because they werent served within 30 seconds of pounding on the door, they got in their car, and drove off. So logically, we skip them to serve the next customer that has pulled a ticket.   


About two hours later, they come back, with the ticket they had pulled before, we had already served 5 additional customers since they left and had another 2 waiting in line when they came back.   


When I went out to bring in the next customer they called me out and complained that I never called their number and that they had called the store twice that they havent been let in.   
They never called our location and they were never present when I called their number (we call anyways just in case, If they did call our company it likely was another store they called because customers frequently get the numbers for our locations mixed up)

  
So right as the customer I just called walked in the store they demanded to be served saying how they called and they were skipped. I told them ""Ma'am, you were not present when we called your number, that was two hours ago, we have had 7 other customers between then and now, and we have not recieved any calls from customers about being skipped in the parking lot. If you want to be served you are going to need to take another ticket""  


So the customer gets a little irate with me about it being suggested that they lied infront of other people. but eventually quickly switch over to ask what here issue is becuase its a ""quick question""  


The customer, pulled out a 10$ charging brick that was probably for one of those ultra-slim chromebooks saying that their rabbit had chewed on the cable and she needed it fixed. I told her ""we don't fix those cables ma'am, and even if we did, it would cost more to fix it than the charging block its worth, it would be more practical for you to buy a new one"" (it would have cost the customer roughly 8 times the cost of the block because not only is it roughly 70$ for soldering, but the wiring would likely run 10$ for a spool as well and have to be special ordered.  


The customer then asked ""okay, do you sell one?""   
Me: ""no ma'am, the only charging blocks we keep are USB related""   


Surprisingly she just leaves after that without saying another word.  
I am just wondering, what did they do for the two hours between when they left, and when they came back that it didnt occur to them that it would be more practical to just buy a new one.",357,0,1
Customer calls electronics repair shop to restore their deleted [Social Media Platform] account,"Okay so doing electronics repair we get alot of customers that are not technically literate, and ones even less so than that, but this one was just unique for us.   


Today we had a customer call us asking us what the charge would be to restore their deleted \[Social Media Platform\] account.  
So the customer was rather understandably agitated because they couldn't get into their \[Social Media Platform\] account and were going on a lengthy tirade about how they couldn't get in after they changed their password and now it was saying their account was deleted or doesn't exist""

  
So I sit there waiting patiently for my turn to respond because they customer just keeps going on and on about their issue. Until I get a ""hello? are you there? why arent you saying anything?""  
Internally I'm like ""because interrupting is rude and I was waiting for my turn to speak"" 

  
So I just say ""Ma'am we are an electronics repair shop, we cant fix account issues with third party companies, you will need to contact \[Social Media Platform\] Support to resolve issues with your account""  


The customer: ""but i already contacted \[Social Media Platform\] Support and they said they can't do anything, I was told you can recover deleted data!""  


Me: ""Yes ma'am that's true, we can recover deleted data from devices, we can't recover data from a social media account""   


Customer: ""but \[Social Media Platform\] Is on my phone! cant you un-delete the data from that?""  


Me: ""It is not physically possible to recover the data for a social media account because that data isnt stored on your phone its stored on \[Social Media Platform\]'s Servers""  


Customer: ""No, no, you're not listening, \[Social Media Platform\] Is on my phone!""  


Me: ""Yes ma'am The Application too access \[Social Media Platform\] Is on your phone, but the actual data of your social media account is not stored on your phone, its stored on their servers""  


Customer: ""Well cant you just contact their servers then and undelete the data there?""  


Me: ""No ma'am we dont have access to their servers, again you need to contact \[Social Media Platform\] Support and have them recover your account""  


Customer: ""But I already did that!  They said my account was deleted!""   


Me: ""Again, \[Social Media Platform\] Support is the only place you can get help with this issue\]""  


Customer: ""okay, I guess ill just make a new one, Thanks....""  


Me internally: ""Why didnt you just make a new one in the first place?""",263,0,1
Stuck in an endless loop,"This story is from a few years back.

I was part of a recruiting department doing everything that did not require that much people skills, mostly reporting, presentations and admin of the software that was used.

The team was rather big around 25 people and since business was booming they needed to hire about 5 more recruiters. Since I was in charge of the system it was my job to train the new recruiters to use it. I go trough all the motions explain all the functions even make them do some practice runs in the test instance. I thought it all went well.

Fast forward to about a month later and one of the new colleagues furiously asks me if I can swing by her place as she has and I quote ""bug"" in the software approval flow. I say that I have a report to finish for the boss and I don't really have the time now but she starts bitching and screaming that she can't work like this and that the ""piece of shit"" software is always making her late with all her work.

I stop what I was doing and drag myself to her computer and asks her to show me what the actual problem is.

I guess a bit of explanation is needed for how this ""mindbogglingly difficult"" approval flow is used. You basically input the names of the approvers manually from a list according to the company structure up to the CEO . The only catch is you actually need to put in the list in order otherwise the approval would not be according to company standards and the candidates cannot be placed.

If you fuck up the order and can't read the organisational chart right, next to each name in the approval list there are 2 arrows one up one down so you can easily move the names in the correct order.

Back to miss ""bug"".

She proceeds to show me a list of 3 people that need to approve where she accidentally added the first guy in the last place.

She then starts yelling that the stupid arrows don't work and clicks the up arrow for the guy to go one level up. Guess what happens? It works, the guy switches places with the one above, all fine but instead of using any brain matter and move the mouse cursor 5 pixels up to click the up arrow next to the name of the guy she actually wanted to move, she just clicks again and of course we're back to square one the 2 guys just switch places. She then just keeps clicking, the guys keep trading places  and she keeps screaming louder and louder that this is wasting her time and how bad the software is. I'm literally stunned, I just stare at the magical moment of her being stuck in an endless loop of stupidity, just thinking this is so worth getting my ass chewed out by the boss for delivering the report late.

I don't have any idea for how long I was in this wonderful daze but I guess it was long enough for a crowd to gather behind me. One of my other team mates leans next to me chuckling asking are you gonna help her out or should I.

I snap out of it and ask her if I may use her mouse, at this point she realizes as well that half the office has gathered around us and pipes down. I gently and precisely click the arrow up then move the mouse following the guys name, I do this as slowly and deliberately as possible so she can follow, then click again. These two clicks have been the most satisfying two clicks in my entire career.

Then I asks her if she needs anything else and quickly move to my desk trying not to piss myself laughing.

The girl ends up resigning a couple of month later due to the ""high pressure"" environment.

"Phases of data loss - database corruption, backup failures, filesystem corruption.","Ugh, grand day. I hope this fits the subreddit, since this is more of a vendor-customer support scenario, but eh. I feel bad contributing to someones bad day. I guess I just need to vent somewhat. 

Basically, there's us, the vendor, our customer, and their MSP who's providing them with VMs and other services. We're managing our product on their premises, on a VM provided by said MSP. It started of rather dull. Basically, our customer experienced mass VM reboots on thursday. Nothing too worrying - power failure in a HV or something like that. Our application didn't recover from the VM reboot, so they logged a ticket.

All fine, that's why we have support contracts. Our support engineer takes a look at it and.. well yeah. The mysql DB doesn't start due table storage corruptions. Hum. Usually, it's rare for a mysql to break like that due to a reboot. It can happen. Usually, you lose writes because some transactions roll back, but that's about it.

So, we recommend resetting the system to the freshest backup, ideally yesterday. Our support hours could be used more effectively to get the restored system back up and working, instead of spending time on a broken database. Our contact admin agrees and seems happy about the solution. No weird fiddling, recover the VM, vendor fixes it, systems back up. It's a good plan, 15 - 30 minutes of routine work on our side.

So... off the local admin goes, and eventually responds back. This was the fourth or fifth VM the MSP had failed to backup for over a month. Ergs. There are a few phrase combinations I dislike. ""Table space corruption"" and ""backup failures"" is certainly up there, because at that point you've lost data. Pfsh... Well I guess ""backup failure"" combined with anything except ""backup failure fixed"" is a good way to ruin day.

Ok, so I get pulled in, as one of our experienced mysql / database admins in our saas platform. Backups are the better answer, but sometimes, you gotta do ugly, scary things with innodb recovery tools. So I go ahead, teamviewer in with the local guy and our support engineer... first steps first, copy the database files cold into a second location. There's zero reason to attempt a data recovery without a cold backup folks. If possible at all, pull copies or drive images if you have to do something like this. Then... windows starts complaining about files being unreadable and corrupt and broken. Oh boy.

Some tinkering with nasty recovery settings later, I'm also convinced. We can't tell if the database is corrupted or not, because apparently the filesystem is corrupted to a point the database is even unable to load the files. Or the storage directory. 

On linux you can kinda provoke these kind of issues by either chown'ing your table files to a different unix user so your DB cannot access them anymore, or by invalidating the directory tree through inode manipulation. The first one is very common while implementing restore procedures if you're not careful about chown'ing all the files back to mysql. But this was a windows that had rebooted, nothing else.

Poor guy then spilled it - this would be almost a dozen VMs with apparently broken drives or filesystems and the MSP denies it. It really smells like some large scale storage failure they don't want to admit. It's kind of routine for me to prepare for a postmortem and such, so I helped him collect screenshots and logs documenting the filesystem corruption from our applications point of view. Then, chkdisk was fired off and we've scheduled again for monday so we don't spend billable support hours waiting for chkdsk and trying to get the drive back... 

But as much I hate it, that system is probably fucked. The filesystem check is running for way too long at this point and if it ever finishes, it'll probably wipe out the database storage. Possibly render the system unbootable. At this point, I'd need that VMDK to possibly have a chance to recover content, but that's out of contract. And it's possible a lot of systems are entirely wiped out over there. What an end to the day.

I feel bad for that admin :( His next week won't be fun.",162,0,1

The enemy of my enemy is my friend,"Long time lurker, got reminded of this story and decided to share it. Hope it fits on this sub.

A couple of years ago I was working as a web developer for a small company. Besides developing websites, I was also the tech support for the company. For one of our clients we were developing an electronics webshop. The client had been with the company for a long time, way before I started working there. The website recently had a mayor redesign and we were still implementing a lot of new functionality.

One of the new functionalities had to do with importing all the products from a third-party management system. They used that system to manage their products, stocks, product attributes etc. etc. The system would export all the data every night and our webshop would import it again.

One day I get an e-mail from the client that he wanted to add some new custom attributes that had to be exported and imported. Both systems (the management system and our webshop) needed some changes to accommodate these new attributes. Obviously, it was my job to make the changes to our system while the other party needed to change the management system. However, for some reason, this time the client demanded that I made contact with the other party to request the changes to their system, which was something he always used to do himself.

Ah well, it's in my job description so I looked up their contact info and made the call.

Once I got a hold of one of their developers I explained to him what changes the client wanted. To my surprise their developer got angry with me and stated that the client should stop requesting changes to their system so often. He should either keep it the way it is, or request all the changes at once instead of small changes time after time. By his tone I could hear he was not very likely to make the changes anytime soon.

But I felt that his anger towards me was a bit misdirected. I told him that I'm in the same boat as him. That I'm just the guy developing the website who now also has the make the changes to our system again to accommodate these new attributes and that I'm only asking this because our mutual client ordered me to do so.

I immediately felt his tone changing. He sympathised with me once he realized I was just as annoyed by the client's requests as he was. He said he'd keep me updated about his progress, and indeed, 2 days later I got an e-mail that it was fixed and I should see the new attributes appearing in the next import.

To clarify, if you read between the lines you might get the impression that I wasn't particularly fond of this client. Which is true. It was one of those clients that marked every e-mail as urgent and regularly made angry calls with the project manager complaining about all the stuff we're doing wrong and how he wasn't gonna pay for a lot of the work. However, I could understand his attitude. The team that was working on his website slowly dwindled over time from 8 guys working in actual sprints to just me and an intern. He was used to a certain level of service, and for some reason, the company continuously lowered that level without letting the client know there were some internal changes that would impact the quality of the work we did for him.",243,0,1
Excel's gonna getcha! The tale of a catastrophic excel export function.,"I was inspired by the post about researchers having to rename the genes in the human genome to avoid excel interpreting them as dates. I was witness to a similar stupidity in Excel years ago. Let me tell you the story...

Years ago, I used to support a web app that was written by the company I worked for. Over the years it had grown very large and convoluted, with many pieces being jammed together to provide a custom solution when customers wanted it. It was pretty modular, and so every customer had a slightly different view of the system and what it could do.

One day, I got a call from a customer who complained that the excel export function did not work. They had, according to them, ""been using it for years and now it didn't work"". Digging further into the issue, it seemed that they were getting an excel file, but all the serial numbers had been mangled. Specifically, the final few digits were all zeroes! This is obviously not what you want when dealing with product serial numbers, and so I set to work.

First of all, let's rewind the clock to the first time I had to deal with excel export issues. A customer was complaining that they were getting an error when exporting to excel, that excel would say that ""the file type does not appear to be in excel format"" but that the file would open anyways and had all the correct data. When I asked the programming team, their response was ""that's just the way it is, tell them to deal with it."" I thought that was awfully strange, and so I decided to dig into the matter a bit further. It turns out that someone had found a cheap trick, and exploited it to provide users with a quick and dirty excel export. You see, the file that they got, which ended in _.XLS_, was actually not an excel file. If you can believe it, it was actually the very same HTML as the page you were just looking at! Through some incredible fluke, excel actually opens HTML files and does some sorta internal conversion so you can work on them like excel files! Other than my mind being blown, I realized I had found the reason for the error, those file were in fact not excel files. However, getting the browser to reliably download an HTML file instead of displaying it on screen was tricky, and also getting the user to open an HTML file using excel was an exercise in frustration. So the solution was to just have the web app pause, rename the page, and then send it again and it would initiate a download. 

Fast forward back to today and I thought back to that time. ""Aha, for sure the HTML is not making it into Excel the way it should be!"" but upon closer inspection, that module had been disabled! In fact, we had never offered nor mentioned anything about an excel export function to this customer. They were a newer customer running a newer version and as such the hacky export function was disabled by default! This made me really worried, because how did they think they were exporting to excel if the feature was disabled?

Well it turns out that excel inserts a hook into internet explorer (and I mean you _had_ to use IE because that's what all good web apps require, amirite?) and allows you to click on literally any web page that contains a table and export that into Excel. How it works, I dunno. We even tried telling them that this was entirely Microsoft's fault, because we never intended that feature to be used on our software. They screamed and cried because they had just produced millions of dollars of product, and because they could not prepare a list of serial numbers to be checked off they had no way to verify the production. They begged us for a solution, anything that would get those serial numbers onto an Excel sheet!

So back to work I went, replicating the customer data and trying this inadvertent export function that had apparently been forcibly re-added to our application! This is when I saw it, the serial numbers were being converted into scientific notation, and they had been using a template or some sort of formatting to turn them back into long strings of numbers. Like they said, the final digits were missing here too, making the serials useless. I re-enabled the excel export on my end, and asked it to do its thing. I got a HTML file masquerading as an Excel file, as I expected. I opened up the HTML/XLS in VScode and lo and behold, the serial numbers were there, in all their 20 characters of glory. ""Well that's wierd,"" I said to myself, ""They exported just fine!"" But when I opened the file in excel, those numbers weren't the same! They all ended in zeroes! At first I was confused, but after showing a co-worker how this worked, we concluded that excel had a maximum limit of _precision_ that it would accept, and it would truncate and convert to scientific notation anything beyond that limit. We tried _everything_ but Excel would see those numbers and immediately mangle them! Pasting them in triggered the conversion, using a CSV file produced from a script also caused the conversion. We even tried manually copying the data from the database into an excel file with some cells that had been prepared as text but somehow Excel was hellbent on not letting us paste those numbers in.

I believe we eventually gave up. There was no way Excel would accept that data without mangling it. I think we scripted a dump of part of the database and we gave them a text file containing the serial numbers with the instructions to open it in _anything_ but Excel!

Oh Excel, why you gotta be like this? As an aside, Open/LibreOffice did not suffer from this bug! However, I was the only believer in open source software so my idea to use that instead was not met with much acceptance. Whaddya gonna do?",697,0,1
When technology is moving forward but the department managers want to move back.,"I work for a company that has specific ADHOC reporting needs. For those unfamiliar with the term or need clarification, it's non-standard, customized reporting for our clients needs. I primarily deal with large database report creation and I mostly work out of Excel. But I also help out the Developers because of my SQL and SSRS background.  For clarification, I was hired for my Excel proficiency and if I'm being honest, this company got a deal when they hired me because I'm a jack of all trades and it's skill set is perfect for this line of work. In contrast, the people I report too are as far from Excel proficient as you can get. Wish I was kidding when I say the formula =SUM() is a challenge to some of them. I know, I've watched them struggle and they work exclusively with Excel day in and day out for years.

Government regulations and industry standards have pushed our companies Tech requirements further and further. Part of those requirements were a new SSRS Reporting server. Yeah!! finally upgraded from 2008 to 2019!  Automated Excel reports go from .xls to .xlsx, 56K row limitations to 1 million rows plus. 256 columns can now exceed 1000 Columns. (before you ask, yes we have departments that need 256+ columns of information).

But the #1 complaint I hear every week from the same 2 department managers is, ""*Why can't we have Pivot Tables on these Automated Reports?*"".  If your face is screwed up in a Huh expression as you ask yourself ""but... you can have Pivot Tables on those Reports, just insert them?!?!"", you're mimicking the entire IT department every time this question is asked. What the two department managers actually  want and are complaining about is for Pivot Tables to automatically to show up on automated reports without having to be inserted. Yes, they are that lazy.

They don't want Tablix summaries, they don't want a Static Mirror of what the Pivot tables show. They want to be able to double click into the numbers and get the sheet with just those orders they want to see.

They don't want to spend 30 seconds to a minute to create their own Pivot table. They want it automatically done for them. I've tried compromising with them, giving them extra sheets of information. Providing them extra details so they can easily get to the info they need. Nope, all rejected. They only want to see the Pivot Tables. So what are they talking about if this feature never existed on automated reports from a MS report server.  It's done through my predecessor via a VBA Macro.  Specifically, one that is used exclusively on a report that was generated from a report from the 2008 Reporting server.

My mistake was attempting to recreate this macro for there two managers for the new 2019 Reporting server report so we can shut down the old jalopy... ""*Yes, this is what we want, Now do it for all these other 70 reports you've created that we have been asking you to do it on*""

Suuuuure, I'll get right on that. Top priority! let me stop all these client reports from our remaining paying customers during this Pandemic. Also I'll hold all requests from people who need invoicing and RFI's from Sales teams constantly flooding in from potential new clients just so you can perform a feature that you are already capable of doing yourself right now.

How do I even..,"Hi all! long time lurker, first time poster. I have a short but fun little tale about a user who just cant..

So to put this into context, I used to work for a managed service provider (MSP) but was stationed permanently on a helpdesk at a catholic school not to far from where I live. Each week at this school, the admin staff would put up a newsletter for the teaching staff which contains weekly events and schedules. 

This newsletter was simply to be uploaded into the same spot on google drive so that our intranet could be directed to it without the link having to change after each upload, but the admin staff still wanted the responsibility of updating the newsletter.

The staff member responsible for uploading this newsletter, B, was so incapable of basic computing (or anything that her job position entailed) that every week first thing monday, we were poised for the call.

All that B needed to do was open her google drive, locate the file that she would be updating, right click and select 'Update Versions' before browsing to the new copy of the file and completing the upload.

At first when B would call, we would walk over to her office, and with her there beside us, we would show her through the steps of how to update the document. This would be fine until the next week when we would get the call ""Hi fellas, I have forgotten how to upload that file, you know the one I have to put into google? could someone please come and help me"".

We eventually tried to change our tactic so that she would have a better chance of remembering the steps, each new week trying a different method to direct her through the simple upload process.

Initially we tried letting her perform the task as we watched and directed her through the proces. This graduated eventually to us emailing her the steps of how to upload the dreaded newsletter file. and without fail even still the next week we would receive the call to arms.

It got to the point where we would even have her write down her own instructions in her own words while we talked her through the steps so that she could finally manage to complete this task independently...

it pains me to tell you that we eventually gave up.. She clearly didn't want to learn.. and we weren't in a position to be able to change/affect the behaviour..

tl;dr- tried every approach under the sun to show a user how to use.. got nowhere..",1017,0,1
More Tales from Incompetent Security,"I’ve talked before about my dislike of our security team. Two stories from just yesterday:

----
One thing they’ve done for longer than I’ve been here is refuse to follow up with their tickets. My team, Desktop Support, gets tickets with notes like the following from them all the time. 

&gt;User added to AD group. Sending to Desktop Support to make sure user has access to what they need. 

As you can imagine, this is annoying, and often turns us into middlemen when the issue isn’t fixed and the ticket gets passed back to Security to fix again and back to Desktop Support to confirm if resolved. We’ve tried for years to get them to follow up on their tickets and close them, but management has let them continue passing them on. 

Yesterday morning we received one of these tickets. I don’t think much of them at this point and just assigned it to one of my team members. Later that afternoon the ticket pops back up in our queue unassigned. I figured it was another case of the above, whatever security did failed to resolve the issue and it had to go back to them before they gave it back to us. 

Looking at the notes however, I see the following from us:

&gt;Desktop Tech: Per Desktop Manager, Verification of resolution must be obtained by the team or person who completed the work. Returning to Security.

&gt;_Assignment Group: Security was Desktop Support_

And then right after that this:

&gt;Security Tech: a

&gt;_Assignment Group: Desktop Support was Security_

Security Tech clearly disagreed with that. I doubt he’ll even get called on not updating tickets properly. 

I don’t know if they are finally being told to follow up on their tickets, but I took a screenshot of those notes and sent it to Desktop Manager, who just said he’d take care of it.

When people decide to dance to the beat of their own drum,"I work at a large car dealership.

One of the employees from one of our remote sites just sent me an email.

USER:  ""Can you add me to the spare parts email group""

She doesn't work in spare parts, she works in Sales as the Pre-delivery Coordinator.  

Me:  ""Why do you want access to that department group?""

U: ""I want to receive copies of the repair orders that come in""

OK, this doesn't make any sense.  When a salesperson has done a deal, they're supposed to email the repair order^1 to the pre-delivery and parts departments.  There is an email address which is basically predeliverybranch@location.com which contains the necessary people who should be getting this email address.  She is already in this group.

M:  ""That doesn't make any sense, you're already in the predeliverybranch@location.com email address, you should be getting the RO's""

U:  ""I don't, only the parts guys get the RO's and I need them.""

So I call up the Parts Manager.

M:  ""Hey PM, what's going on?  USER says that you get copies of the RO's from the sales people but she doesn't""

PM:  ""Yeah, it's because the salespeople email sparepartsbranch@location.com.au instead of predeliverybranch@location.com""

So I get back onto User

M: ""Tell the sales people they need to use predeliverybranch@location.com to email RO's instead of sparepartsbranch@location.com""

U: ""Oh, they won't do that.  COLLEAGUE has already asked them to do that 100 times but they don't""

It just so happened that COLLEAGUE happened to be on the same site as User.  So I asked COLLEAGUE  what was going on.  Turns out she's been telling the salespeople at this branch for ages to use predeliverybranch@location.com, but they don't listen.

Then I got an email from the Service Manager.  He said I should delete predeliverybranch@location.com as no-one uses it.  Every other one of our branches use their version of this email address and the process works perfectly.

I gave up.  I added User to the parts department email address, walked out to the car park and cried for a bit until I cheered up at the thought of USER getting bombarded by the hundreds of parts invoices that this branches parts department receive daily on the spare parts group email address.

1 - A repair order or RO is basically a list of jobs that the person working on the car needs to perform.  In the service department, it's a list of job's the mechanics need to carry out (servicing, warranty, recalls, stuff the customer has said is a problem etc).  In Pre-delivery, it is a list of jobs that the pre-delivery fitters need to do (clean car, fill with petrol, fit extras like spotlights and ute tray, change wheels &amp; number plates) depending on the bargain the salesperson did with the customer.  Pre-delivery is a department under Service's umbrella at our dealerships,",210,0,1
"""You didn't do it right! 😡""","Hello everyone! Been working in a support role for a couple years now and keeping most of my stories under wraps until I leave my current job, but this one was in the family, so thought I could share it right away. 

My mom used to use an old Windows 8 laptop that could barely handle simple tasks. After having it for two years, she burned the battery out on it twice by leaving it powered on 24/7 but had it ""plugged in all the time, so it's fine"". After multiple battery replacements and years of frustratingly bad performance, I got her a Chromebook since all she really does is browse the web, and the slow abomination went into hibernation. 

Recently, we're planning on moving and we're cleaning out old junk. We came across her old laptop and this is where my most recent story comes from. 

$m: me $p: mom

$p ""Hey, what do I need off of this old laptop before I get rid of it?""

$m ""Whatever you wanna keep from it, really.""

$p ""Well what is that?""

$m ""All your pictures and stuff that you want to keep. I'm not sure what you want, so you'll have to go through and pick and choose what you want off of there.""

$p slightly annoyed ""can't you just do it for me??""

At this point I just decide I'll back up her entire user profile for her so she can pick and choose later. After a few minutes, everything is backed up to an SD card and I plug it into her Chromebook for her. 

$p ""how do I view the SD card again?""

This is a pretty constant question from her, but I tend to give her a pass since she doesn't file browse too much. 

$m ""you just go here and click on the card.""

I pull up the SD card and open her user profile so now the options on screen are her desktop, documents, music, pictures, and videos folders (as well as some system files from windows that aren't hidden by Chrome OS anymore)

$p ""so where are my pictures?""

$m ""they'll be in the same folders where they were on your other laptop. Go ahead and click on the desktop folder, I know a few were there.""

She then proceeds to click on, what I assume was, a system file windows had made and was now visible. 

$p ""it's not loading anything! I can't see my pictures!"" 

$m ""you didn't click on a picture file, that's a system file, go ahead and just ignore it for now. All your pictures are kept in those five folders at the top of the screen. Go ahead and click on one of them and we'll look in there.""

She then proceeds to click another system file 

$p ""My pictures aren't there!! You did it wrong!! Copy everything again!""

At this point, I grab the mouse from her and decide I'll have to be the navigator for this expedition 

$m ""if we go ahead and click on this folder up top labeled desktop, we can see all the stuff you had on your desktop.""

I open a picture sitting in the folder to show her that I did indeed copy her info for her. She inspects it for a second and scrolls through the few pictures in that folder. 

$p ""Three pictures??? That's not all of them!!""

$m ""That's true, most are probably kept in this folder on the desktop called 'pictures'."" 

I open up the pictures folder for her and she begins combing through it and finally seems satisfied. 

Definitely not anywhere near the worst communication I've ever had with someone but it really amazes me how some people act like they can't process English once they're in front of a computer",1487,0,1

Intermittent connection? Better get a static IP!,"This one will be short, I'm still at a bit of a loss for it.  

I'm a desktop support technician for the corporate office of a major telecom. Grabbed a ticket to install software for a user  that requires ADM rights, but they didn't mention anything about what software they wanted. Already seemed fishy, as they have access to install most approved applications on their own without our help.  

I reached out to ask, and he said he wanted *insert 3rd party VPN* installed. Already a big nono, there's no way we would allow a 3rd party VPN on a corporate machine.  

When I asked him why he needed it, he said that his connection gets dropped every few hours and when he called his ISP, they told him it's because he's getting packet loss because his DHCP address is changing and he needs to buy a static IP to prevent it from happening.  

......  

Apparently he's had the same issue on his personal machine, but when he connects to *thirdpartyVPN* on it the issue no longer occurs.  

At least he was willing to call back his ISP to work with someone else after I explained to him why we couldn't install his required software and why it's not an actual solution to his problem. It's going to be a fun day.",236,0,1
"DNS servers don't go down, right? AKA the rain dance of reboots.","Hey all I've been wanting to post a few stories for a while and just recently left the clinic so I'm good to go.

I worked at a small medical clinic with intermittent contracted IT support and management that was hostile to feedback or learning from mistakes. The staff was amazing though and the management was also fairly lazy so the day-to-day ran well despite the occasional issues.

I am not IT, I just have a smattering of interest. My general rule in the workplace is if I can fix something in 30 seconds without anyone knowing, I'll do it. That way I can't be blamed later. If it takes longer than that, I need to be specifically asked and lay out in a conversation what to expect. Like many I would do this for free outside my role because either way it's myself and my coworkers who have to bare the brunt of this stuff.


----

Roughly a couple times a month the clinic internet would go down. This would usually last a few hours and wreak havoc in the middle of appointments, locking the POS systems and doing something to mess up synchronous file access on the network. The terminal software used a local database but I guess it was in contact with the remote service somehow I didn't really know, just that we were warned to stop trying to input notes or pull templates through menus and obviously clients payments couldn't be processed. The inventory probably also didn't work.

The solution? The most senior support staff was sent down to the server room for usually 2-3 hours during the busiest time of day to ""reboot the server"" as the doctors pulled their hair out and the front desk staff were buried alive. Periodically during this process we'd be instructed to shut down *every computer* in the clinic for 30-60 minutes, so we couldn't even pull client records, then boot them all back up. If it didn't work, we'd be blamed for somehow messing that up. Again, this happened almost weekly. For years.

I could never really figure out the server infrastructure at this place, I'd only poke around long enough to not recognize anything under my 30 second rule. it was one tower with a dual boot between XP and some Microsoft server management. It serviced 6 desktop PCs, POS, and a variety of lab equipment. But our internet was unique since it was ""over air"" with a SIM card in the modem since cable hadn't been laid at the time the building was bought and the owner decided not to shell out for a shunt when a nearby subdivision finally laid it across the front of the property.

Then one day it happened. With management missing another day, the senior employee tied up on the phone in the server room, one of the doctors in a state of crisis approached me and asked if I could try to get the internet back up. I gave a brief rider that I'm willing to try if they're making a direct request even though it's not my role and I can't guarantee anything blah blah blah. They said that's fine.

So I pulled up CMD and started some basic troubleshooting. We already knew rebooting the modem didn't fix it. By my observation rebooting the server had *never* done anything given the massive time variance in yielding a solution. I suspected it was a rain dance that resulted in the real problem coincidentally running its course. My guess was it was just a service disruption with the ""over air"" internet but in testing that turned out to not entirely be the case.

In fact in testing, no matter what I did, what I changed or reset, it just came back to the message ""DNS server not responding"".

Now I have a limitation in my skills, so all I'm doing is trying to narrow down the problem and tossing out the reliable standards. Flushing cache, etc, so as it got increasingly less intuitive I figured it was above me to diagnose and I might as well back off before experimenting creates new problem. 

But I kept coming back to ""DNS server not responding"". Okay, that's a sign that *something* isn't working. But it's not like DNS servers go down, right? Well what if I'm overthinking this. What if I pretend like it is.

So I log into the modem (default credentials I could google obviously), navigate to the DNS page, and flip it over to Google Public DNS.

Immediately the internet comes back up. There's an almost stunned, guilty silence as the staff, with someone still in the server room hacking away with management on the phone, gets back to work.

Now of course the DNS server didn't actually go down. But what I gathered from a google search afterwards (hoping for a permanent solution) is that the particular model of router we have, proprietary design for the ISP SIM card, may-or-may-not have a recurring firmware bug with the way it stored DNS information which was not remedied by a reboot or the other typical methods. There was one update which didn't fix the problem. After that it was abandoned because, I assume, the client base was so small they didn't see a need to support it. Simply swapping out the DNS address however did convince it to fix itself. I know this because a couple weeks later the Google Public DNS ""stopped responding"" and switching it back to default DNS brought the internet back up again. Our total downtime, finally, was under a minute.

So here's the kicker. Next time management was in I approached them privately and explained briefly what happened. That I'd been asked to diagnose the problem and I found a simple, immediate solution that they could recreate in the future and I'd be happy to show them how. Hell I could write them a script and just automate the intervention weekly as a preventative measure. Just let me know a good time to go through it with them. They said sounds great and didn't get back to me. But I like to push these issues so I politely approached them again in a week, same response.

The third time I approached them they finally yielded. I was told, point blank, ""the server reboot method I use works fine, it's just that the other employee doesn't do it right.""

Two weeks later that other employee approached me, privately and under their breath said they'd heard I knew how to fix the internet and asked if I could show them now. I did and they fixed it that way from then on with no other mention of it.

Kicker part 2: two years later management moved the clinic software database/suite entirely onto the cloud based on a pitch from the developer's sales, with our existing internet, abandoning the local server, and as you can imagine they've had a ton of problems since.

Some background information:

I am changing logins to one standard across all our systems for consistency sake, and also because people keep forgetting which login standard is used for which system.

Because of this, I am asked frequently ""hey whats my login for \_\_\_\_\_?""

My solution: Change logins for everything to Firstname.Lastname, that way it will be less confusing.

Okay, now I sent out a very detailed email last week explaining what I was going to do. I very explicitly stated you will need to use the new login on Monday. And I explained everything, or so I thought.

Quick Note: Windows saves your username from the last time you logged in, and when you go to login, you only need to authenticate, either with password, PIN, etc. So for years people have not had to do this, until now. So it's understandable that they are thrown off by this change.

However, today, my sister sent me texts saying she can't login. I go over the usual ""Logins have changed, they are now Firstname.Lastname"" and ""your password did not change, same password""

She starts to get frustrated because it is apparently not working. She asks for another suggestion. In the meantime I have just logged in using her credentials, and the system let me in on the first try. (I asked for her password, I know, not the best practice).

I tell her ""try again"" and boy, did that set her off. She accused me of having a poor attitude and suggested that I look for another job, because ""try again"" is unprofessional.

To which I responded ""I literally just logged in using the exact credentials I told you. I said try again because it is working....you just need to try again"".

And this is coming from the person who shouts ""woo bonus!"" in front of a bunch of employees who are not eligible to receive company bonuses. And on top of that, who also when asking me to pose for a photo for the company facebook page, I politely declined, her response was ""lol you do realize there are already photos of you on there, right?"" (she literally typed lol, so she thinks my right to decline a photo is funny for some reason).

So, you tell me who is the unprofessional one here. Oh, bonus point, one of my best friends recently quit and moved out of state because he could not stand working with her. Complained to me all the time about her shit.

Percussive Troubleshooting,"Crosspost from r/navy

I saw a post on a different reddit and it remided me of something that happened to me back in the '80's when I wore Navy Blue.

My ship was out near San Clemente doing an anti-aircraft firing exercise.

We were all set up and ready to roll and our Captain decided to come down to Gun Plot (down in the bowels of the ship where we keep all the electronics that keep the big explodey things pointing away from people we don't want to explode) to watch the fun from there.

Our ship was not horribly old but it was built in the depths of the Vietnam war. At the time it was built he Navy had its budget cut and as a result our gun fire control system was actually reused from a Korean War era destroyer. Lots of vacuum tubes and socket mounted components. After 50 years of use they get finicky.

So the target plane comes in and we're tracking it getting ready to shoot, and then... my displays go blank. Nothing. No green blinky lights anywhere.

The CO starts to get upset. He was new and this was his first live fire exercise as CO.

I look at it and I had seen this before.

Immediately to my left was a series of equipment drawers containing all the aforementioned vacuum tubes.

I grabbed the handle of the drawer I knew to be the problem.

Turned it.

Opened the drawer...

SLAMMED it shut as hard as I could.

Green blinky lights come back on and our target is tracked and ready to shoot at.

The CO just shook his head and walked out. He never again visited Gun Plot during an exercise. I think he just didn't want to disrupt the dark arts it took to keep 50 year old electronics running.",403,0,1
Flying off the handle because of operational error,"Background: user was working from home and claimed that VPN system would not work. User had put in 6 tickets over the last month via other users submitting for them all on the same issue.

$U=user

$IT= Me

$U has  input another ticket through one of their co-workers claiming that the VPN system would not work.$IT called user to discuss over the phone since they were working from home for obvious reasons.


$IT: Hi $U, it seems that one of your co-workers put a ticket in for you saying that you were having an issue with VPN again. Looking through ticket history it seems like you have six other tickets over the last month or so for the same issue and each resolution seems to point to something changed from an operational standpoint. It doesn't appear there any hardware or software resolutions in any of the previous tickets. Could we go through some of the basic troubleshooting steps to make sure that we aren't missing anything obvious?

$U: How dare you say that the issue is with me, I'm [age] years old, it's not my job to know it stuff! It's really insulting that you say that this is an operator error when it's your software that's always messing up and I'm just trying to do my job!

$IT: I understand, there was no insult meant by saying that the previous resolutions appear to be operational. I just meant to say that it doesn't appear that the issue is with the software or your computer hardware so I'd like to try some of the troubleshooting with you before we try to remote in and waste your time. Could we please just try going through some of the basic troubleshooting steps to make sure there is nothing that we are missing?

$U: fine but I know what your software that's messing up!

$IT: okay, great. So just to be safe, before trying to connect to VPN can you access the internet through any web browser? Are you receiving any errors when you try to connect to the VPN?

$U: my internet is fine, I can get on the web. I don't pay attention to the errors I get when I try to connect to the VPN, it just shows me a bunch of numbers and then says it fails. Your software is broken.

$IT: okay, those numbers represent percentage connectivity, could you try to connect to VPN again and tell me what percent it shows before failing?

$U: it gets to **%, see I told you your software was broken.

$IT: I'm sorry, that percentage indicates that there is a username or password error, is it possible you have your passwords saved or maybe mistyped? We've noticed that many people will save their password but forget to update it after they change it.

$U: my password is fine, I can type just fine.

While the user was checking this, $IT pulled the report on user's account for password expiration information. The user's password has expired 2 days prior. We also send out an email prior to expiration informing the user that their password will expire soon and that they should update it as soon as possible.

$IT: so I just looked up your account information, it looks like your password expired a few days ago. You should have received an email mentioning that your password will expire soon, did you get that?

$U: I don't pay attention to emails from your automated systems oh, you guys are always just sending us stuff to annoy us.

It's worth noting that all the emails that our Department sent out are either informational to inform people of a new change or for security training to make sure that people aren't falling for phishing scams.

$IT: I understand, those emails are actually important and are meant for your security and to help you prevent issues such as the one we're seeing now by keeping it up-to-date password. Could you please navigate to our password reset web page since you have internet access and reset your password?

$U does this and is able to get into VPN again.

$U: it works now but your software is stupid, it shouldn't matter if my password is expired, I should just be able to get in. I still don't like you said this was my fault!

$IT: I understand, if you receive future password expiration emails or any other email from us please make sure to review it to prevent these issues in future. Have a good day.

The story of software that was too easy to install,"Been doing IT help desk for a little over a year now and I've had my fair share of mind numbing tickets but this one probably takes the cake for the dumbest thing I've seen.

We've got a new user at one of the offices we support, so we're going through the motions of getting all their programs installed. Everything goes smoothly enough, until we get a call a few days later, asking us to install a particular suite of software onto her computer.

Now, this software is something that we have pretty much never had to interact with- barring the occasional password reset- and, even weirder, we have absolutely zero documentation on this stuff at all (barring a nonfunctional admin login).

So my buddy takes this call and is absolutely baffled- apparently everyone in the office now has this software suite installed locally on their computer. So he messages me and asks what I did to install it. Of course I don't know either. We assume there was some breakdown in communication with this new person, and just show her how to open a remote session on the server, which is where all this software is already installed. (sidenote, yes, I said *we* showed her how to do this, because she called back minutes after being shown how to do this because she had forgotten, and I got the call the second time around).

5 minutes later, she's calling again, *insisting* that this software suite needs to be installed on her computer.

Being the jackasses we are, we just say ""you know what? you want this software so bad, fine"" and start googling for install links, knowing they won't work. We rip one off the website and remote onto her computer to install it, but notice this person happened to have their email open. Normally we just ignore it but in this case, she had a message pulled up that had the logo for the software we were about to install, so naturally, we gave it a quick look.

Turns out the reason we had nothing documented for this software suite was because the install was as simple as clicking a link in an email that said ""click here to install this software"". We were just never told about this whole process because it was so self explanatory that the folks at this office didn't think we'd ever need to help install this program for anyone, considering all you need to do is click a link and a couple of ""next"" buttons.

Our new user literally lacks the ability to comprehend a single sentence long email.

After we installed the software, she changed her password to log into it and promptly forgot it 3 minutes later.

You migrated them wrong!,"Hey TFTS! Long time viewer, first time poster.

Some backstory. I work and get paid from a company that has created and acquired several other smaller companies and now am the go-to IT guy for these new companies. I started with the main company in their second year as an intern and have been with the company for nearly 3 years now and have probably gained some trust from my CEO during these years.

Our most recent acquisition required me to migrate all of the newly acquired company's local server data to join our sizable (possibly oversized imo) DropBox corporate account. This was done about 9 months ago and things went without a hitch. That is, until today...

**CEO:** ""Hey frzn, all or most of the migrated DropBox files that you transferred are not accessible. Please check on that and let us know the status ASAP""

**Me:** *Checks permissions settings and sees that all of those who need access already have access granted.* *~~Literally didn't do anything~~* 

**Me:** ""Is there a specific folder in question?  From first glance, I can see the files just fine and can confirm that we all have the same permission settings. As a reminder, the files that were migrated are all within a folder titled ""Migration Files"".

Be nice to IT. We will be nice back.,"I'm gonna keep this short, but I work as a volunteer (I'm under 18) for my school's IT department during study halls and other down times during the day, mostly fixing basic issues, but occasionally there's that one guy.  

Me: me 
Guy: guy
Intuitive I know

Guy: walks in, opens laptop and there is a massive hole to the left of the trackpad.

Me: assuming he wants it fixed, I ask how it happened (to tell if it'd be covered under our accidental damage insurance)

Guy: (visibly nervous) oh, I uh dropped it.

Me: I try to contain my laughter, albeit difficult, I don't even smile at it.  I can clearly tell that this is not drop damage, and it looks like he punched it.  I ask him for his ID to check if he bought the insurance, and he did.  I issue him a loaner, and let him know that it'll be 1-2 days before he gets his fixed and returned.  I didn't have many laptops in queue to be fixed at the time, so I got to his before that period ended.  I put a new keyboard on (the keyboard on these is fixed to the plastics around it, thankfully the trackpad isn't connected or these would be much more expensive fixes) and put his in the done pile, and since the day was almost over I figured I'd return it the next day.

Next day

I come in during my lunch period (I only use about 1/4 of the period to actually eat) and start looking around to see where the deliveries need to go.  I put a sticky note on each laptop with the students' names and rooms during this period, and prepare to make deliveries.  I realize I forgot to put in the system that I fixed his laptop, and I am faced with the decision whether to charge him the $50 or not for the new keyboard, because it could be considered intended damage/vandalism had I put he punched it.  The guy seemed pretty nice, and didn't give me a hard time, so I have him a break.  I put in that the damage was accidental (as in he dropped it) and covered by the insurance.  I put that on the sticky note for his machine and when I gave it back, he smiled at me.  He knew what happened.  I kinda have him a thumbs up and went on my way.  


Sometimes, it pays to be nice to IT.  Literally.

For those wondering why I gave him a break, we were all at an age where we were young and dumb (I'm trying not to be dumb at this age), and I figured that I'm kinda in the same boat, he was probably messing around with friends, and stuff like this happens.  

Edit: clarity, for accidental damage I was referring to if he had dropped it, not him punching it, even if the punch was an accident.

"""my computer doesn't work"" "" I HURT!!""","I used to work for a small / medium sized doctors office with multiple office across our the city and surrounding area.

The time I got paid $250 to drive 30 minutes and move a patch cable.,"So for a side hustle I set up Camera systems for Gas Stations. So while working on a new construction, the owner found out I do IT. So he asked me if I could terminate all the CATV connections in the closet.

It wasn't a big deal, at 16 connections. So I gave him quote and grabbed a patch panel from the trunk of my car. Since contractor grade CATV is a pain in the ass to terminate with a connector. All connections were were done and I tested every connection with my meter. All ports labeled.

So for people that don't know, the gas station's fuel orders are done automatically. The system checks fuel levels and when it gets past a certain point a truck gets called to top off the tanks. 

One of their cables terminated in my patch panel. Since I couldn't get a straight answer on how they wanted it done it was plugged into my switch, which was connected to the modem. But I only had 8 extra ports, so I connected what I thought was important. And taped off the jacks that were blank. 

So the gas company's IT tech comes out. He pulls off the tape over the blank panel and plugs the computer into that. Obviously can't get it to work. 

The owner calls me and I say that jack is blank and to use A-2 which is literally above it. The Gas IT guy then says he needs a direct connection, even though I know he doesn't. So I told him go to the patch panel and patch the cable to any port he wants. 

Needless to say he couldn't figure it out. Even with every jack labeled and a sheet next to a panel that also says what's connected where. 

So I drove over, unplugged the cable from my switch and connected it to jack B-2. Billed him $250, and proceeded to go home. I was on site for less than 15 minutes. Most of which was spent laughing.

Me ""Okay, what exactly, is happening""

Manager - ""It shows database error when i click on ""Companyname"" 

Me - ""Alright give me 5 minuets""   
I jump straight onto his NUC PC since the issue is most commonly fixed by restarting a few things, and I was being a bit lazy. 

After restarting it I asked Me - ""Okay try it now""

Straight away the guy goes ""Nah mate, didn't work"" 

He was a bit too quick to respond since Usersoftware takes a bit longer to load up, and the user has to login for it to display. I jump onto his PC, and say 

Me - ""Right show me what happens when you login to Usersoftware""

The manager then Clicks on a picture titled ""Companyname"" which is a screenshot of the database error. After looking through his PC I see ""Usersoftware"" at the bottom of his screen, clicking on it opens it up 

Me - ""want to try and login again for me?"" 

Manager, logs in with no issue - ""Ah you're a star, what was the problem""

Me - ""You were opening up a screenshot of the error message rather than the software itself.

How do you get an old lady to say f%#k?,"Get another old lady to say Bingo. Or tell her that she needs to call her internet provider. 

Long time reader, first time poster. I don't work in IT, but i think it still fits here.

I am an HVAC apprentice.  Installing and servicing furnaces, ACs, duct work, mini splits, etc. 

One day a week after my lead (let's call him George Costanza) and I (Jerry Seinfeld) replaced the furnace, coil, and condenser at Elderly Kouple's home (Elaine and Kramer), we get a call from Kramer, who says the system we put in is making an unbearable noise they can hear from the living room. 

Not good. The condenser was sitting on the outside wall of the living room, and if it's making noise loud enough for them to hear, either we messed up the install or the unit was defective.  

We show up and Elaine takes us to the living room.  

Elaine: can you hear it?

We can.  A rumble.  

George: go outside and check the condenser.  I'll check the furnace. 

I go outside expecting the worst, but to my surprise,  the unit isn't even running.  Not in a broken kind of way, it's just not calling to cool now so it's off.  There's no way that was causing the noise. 

I meet back up with George in the living room, he tells me the furnace is also off, no noise there. But we can still hear the rumbling. 

We look around and triangulate the source of the mysterious rumble. We locate a cable box from that company everybody hates for some strange reason which is vibrating heavily.  

Having identified the problem Elaine demands that we fix it. 

I used to work in cell phone sales and service, I'm not a complete tech neophyte so i knew i could turn it off and turn it on and see if that fixed anything. 

It did not.

"Yes, there's an error in the password. No, we won't fix it.","This is an old one from a time long ago when cell phones were used for calling and messages only, and Snake II was the best game available on them, so say… 2006. (Yeah, I know there were better phones available by then, but not in India, not cheaply at least.)

The year before, our government-owned telecom service provider had just started broadband services that it was providing over the same physical cables as our landlines. You needed a frequency splitter at the home end, from where one line went to your phone and the other to your ADSL modem to provide internet. Of the two options our TSP provided – rental ADSL modem or self-owned – I went for the second. However, a clerical error at the exchange level made them think it was a rental, and instead of the 2 weeks promised to me, they thought they could put me at the end of a 4-month waiting list. This was corrected after I went to the exchange myself and raised a ruckus, reaching up to the GM of the zone.

&gt; *(Aside: That ruckus I raised over a decade and a half ago has been very useful since. I’ve never faced an outage when the rest of my housing complex has regular outages – if I face an outage, rest assured that the internet is down for the whole city.)*

Two hours after I met the GM, three engineers including the senior-most at that telephone exchange came home to check what the issue was. He had to reach out to his training officer at the headend, who had to log into the switch to read a few numbers, which when entered in my modem’s settings, started the internet connection I’ve used ever since.

But, you ask, where’s the tech support? 

A few weeks later, I was called on by one of my clients – in college, I’d assembled a few PCs for a few friends – who had taken a similar connection but was facing the same issue. Not my problem technically, the PC was working fine and dialup worked perfectly. He too had reached out to the exchange – his mother worked in government and arranged for engineers senior to those who visited me to check it out but even they had given up. Everything worked fine, even other ADSL accounts, but not this one.

This piqued my interest – the whole issue was a mirror to mine. Could the resolution be the same? Let’s check it out. I asked him to get his phone bill and read out two numbers to me.

&gt; **Me:** Phone Number?    
**Client:** 022 96 555 123. That’s also the username to be used.    
**Me:** Account Number?    
**Client:** 6789055123. They told me to enter this as the password.    
**Me:** And it’s not working?    
**Client:** No. Invalid password it seems.    
**Me:** Ok, you’ll owe me a beer if this works. Try 6789555123 as password and let me know what happens.

I’ll give the readers a minute to guess what happened and why.  Some more clues:

1.	The account number matching the phone number partially was a coincidence, normally they were vastly different.
2.	The same thing had happened to me – my last four digits were the same instead of my friend’s five.

Got it? So here’s what happened.

The TSP’s engineers were new at this broadband game. They also were unionized and working for a government-owned TSP. Thus, bent on reducing their workload anyhow. To reduce their own long-term workload, they had gone ahead and activated broadband at the headend/switch for every single connection in the whole city, to be connected at the exchange level when needed. That’s millions of people who don’t know they have broadband connections already ready to run and are surviving on 128k dialup connections. It was one database query that ran for a long time before services were started (but that’s fine since it’s not even public yet) and somehow a bug crept in affecting a few hundred connections only.

What was that bug?

The actual interconnection would be via the phone line connected to that number, so the billing wouldn’t be affected. But the ADSL security setup asked for a username/password combo. Thus, the phone number as a username and account number as a password. The query was to copy the phone number to the username and the account number to the password fields. But, every time the last 3-4 digits of the account number matched the phone number, what the query did was to transpose the last different digit from the phone number to the password, the starting digits being copied from the account number. Thus, password error of exactly one digit in the middle somewhere.

The phone call one of the engineers who visited me at the start made was to the guy who actually ran the original query. He was able to get into the database and run a reverse query for my specific case, and read out that password for us to enter into my modem. He also told us about the bug. Hence, for my friend, I made an educated guess and told him the expected password.

The next weekend this circle of friends (which included my client) met up for dinner, I didn’t have to pay for a single drink all night.

&gt; **PS:** *For those crying security issues et al – the whole setup I’ve listed is only for billing purposes. It’s the phone line that’s billed, I could use any working username/password combo and it would still bill my landline only.*

TL;DR: If you face a bug that less than 0.01% of the census is facing, it's in your luck that your tech support already has an answer to it.

Have you rebooted the robot correctly?," This is a story that happened last week.  

Everyone that reads the title of the post is correct... sort of. 

&amp;#x200B;

The cast: 

&amp;#x200B;

$me: robot programmer 

$cust: my beloved customer  It is Thursday, and I am at another customer far away (450km / whatever in freedom units) when my phone rings. I speak to a person at the time, and let the caller go to mailbox. Before I can get back to him, my colleague calls me and tells me $cust called and needed help, the industrial PC froze. So I call $cust:  

$cust: greetings 

$me: greetings, what's up? 

$cust: nothing to worry about, called your colleague to sort it out.

(me thinking to myself... hey easy... I can drop the call right here) 

$me: I know, he called me. But I am far away, can you tell me what's up? 

$cust: I don't know, I was not near the robot-cell. 

$me: that's bad, can you go there and give me more details please? 

$cust: I don't know if I get to it today... 

$me: okay it's fine... so it can't be too urgent... call me if you get more info.

&amp;#x200B;

 Skip to the next day... I am on my way home when my phone rings... it's my colleague. $cust called and was not happy that nobody helped him. I told him everything, and we agreed that wewill meet at the customer location and check the problem. we arrived  and $cust was gone. We looked at the robot controller and saw the problem right away. We shut down the machine and waited for everything to shut down. We started everything back up, and it worked like charm.  

The problem was: The robot controller is an PC with a buildin UPS. When you cut power and don't wait for the PC to shut down...  and power on again, nothing will work. The customer lost 2 days of  production for what could have been another 30sec phone call...

*sigh* *huff* *grumble* or: Girlfriend fixes her computer,"*Authors note: I posted this a few years back but it was removed for breaking a ""no family tech support"" rule, as that rule doesn't exist any more, I'm posting it now.*

Home tech support 101: Be the one to try and fix things first, you'll probably fix it quickly and efficiently.  
Relationship goals 101: Don't be the one to try and fix things until she says she needs help, or you WILL regret it.


This is a tale of how these two worlds collide, and collide HARD. The people in this tale are myself ($me) and my Girlfriend ($GF).


Its late November of 2013, and $GF's computer (Windows XP still *important later on*) has been acting up over the last few months, nothing major, but it wont play some of the later games (It used to be my computer, and its a few years old at the point she got it). I've secretly purchased and built a new computer as her Christmas present. One night, she tries so install a game from the DVD drive, and it wont read it. The drive spins, whirs, and does everything that it needs to do, yet Windows says ""no disc"".   
&gt;$GF: *sigh*.... *googles a bit*


I look over, and ask If she'd like me to take a look at it. I get a resounding ""No, I can do it."". I'd like the stress at this point that she knows what she's doing to an extent, she knows her way around a computer, and can diagnose a fair few issues on her own if its software related, hardware escapes her a bit sometimes; and she normally asks me for a second opinion when she's made a determination.

I shrug, and carry on playing my game.  
&gt;$GF: *sighs louder* .... *clicks mouse buttons frustratedly* 

At this point, I'm tempted to just go and have a look myself, but I'm aware that it might be conducive to a night on the sofa. I sit back, and half-heartedly keep an eye on her monitor. 

&gt;$GF: *grumble..* *click click click* *reboots computer*  
&gt;$GF: Great! now the mouse doesn't work! nor does the keyboard! 

My ears prick up. I take over (with a few grumbled protests) and start trying to troubleshoot. sure enough, the mouse doesn't respond, nor does the keyboard. I reboot (with the reset button), and I cant get into the F8 menu, if i hard power off to force it to give me the ""your PC turned off suddenly..."" options, I cant scroll up or down to get into safe mode, but it WILL work in the bios. 

I'm a little bewildered, to be honest, so i ask  
&gt;$Me: What happened?  
&gt;$GF: Maybe its a driver problem.  
&gt;$Me: No, because there aren't drivers *to* uninstall or corrupt, so what exactly did you do?  
&gt;$GF: I followed some steps on google, it was suggested that the firmware of the DVD was faulty. The fix said go to the registry and find a certain key and delete it. So I did.  
&gt;$Me: Which keys?  
&gt;$GF: I don't know.  
&gt;$Me: Did you back them up before?  
&gt;$GF: No.  
&gt;$Me: ...  

She went into the registry, and deleted random keys that someone on the internet told her to. I'm confused, and to be frank, fairly annoyed that she didn't think to ask ""is this a good idea"". But whatever, I've got to fix it. Shes getting a new one, and she will NOT be happy with having no computer for 3 weeks, but I don't want to spend hours on it, because shes getting a new one, I also can't tell her because it's meant to be a surprise. See my dilemma?. Whilst I'm thinking how to get it running, I'm getting occasional remarks like ""Just wipe and reload it"" or ""its a crappy computer anyway"" and ""It'll be annoying to lose some of that data, but if its broken we'll just have to deal with it"". Then a strike of inspiration hits me.  

I go to my backpack and pull out my dvd case (thankfully I'd decided to bring it home that evening) and flip through and find a wonderful tool called ERD Commander by Winternals, In layman's terms, its a windows XP live CD, if you're familiar with those on linux. I reboot the PC, head into the bios, and set the boot order to CD reader (she has a DVD drive (the one thats been playing up) and a CD reader that i put in because why not, I had it spare doing nothing) and ERD loaded up. The mouse and keyboard WORK! Hallelujah! It's slow as shit, but i load up the registry editor, then stop. I don't know what she deleted. How can i put them back? (remember, she didn't back them up before hand), and my computer is Windows 7, my gut tells me that my registry values might not play nice. Back to thinking...

*15 minutes of pondering later*

I've got it, I'll load up my Windows XP virtual machine on MY tower, and export the entire registry, load it to a thumb drive, put it into hers while loaded into ERD and import it. After a bit of playing around to get the USB drive to read, I successfully manage to import the registry file, I remove the ERD disc, reboot the computer.

It works like a charm, mouse works, keyboard works, no data loss. The system seems stable after the registry import. The DVD drive still wont read anything though, But $GF is happy, in fact, you could say she was doing cartwheels. I decide to investigate further into the DVD issue. I turn off the computer, and open the side ""Rule 1: Check the basics"" Connected? *check*, Power? *check*, Master/Slave Jumper? *che--wait a second*. It was set to slave, as was the cd reader below it. I changed it to Master, and as if by magic, everything worked as expected. I had taken it all apart for a good clean about 4 months before, and must have changed the jumper for some reason (my bad). 

Total time it took to get it working, about 2 hours. Lessons learned? Do not fuck with the registry, or the registry will fuck with you. Check the cables. Ask a second opinion *before* you nuke it.

TL;DR: Girlfriend managed to somehow render every form of input into the PC impossible. 10/10 would fuck with registry again.",734,0,1
Looking back... Good Luck and when in doubt PowerCycle.,"Today is my last day working as a L1 tech at a DSL ISP. It’s bitter sweet too look back at the frustrating and head banging moments of the job, like the old people who can’t type in a WiFi PW to save their life or the young people who get mad when they can’t stream with 20 devices connected on 6mb. The  funny ones like an email called moltresfacesitson(gamer tag)@emailaccount.com to pass phrases like 42069 or “Make my WiFi PW BigBlaZr420” and the sad ones, like the guy who set up his unemployment email to go to a nonexistent domain on accident. I’m gonna miss the grind. Anyway, thanks for all the giggles while I wait for calls to roll in and the good stories of why we do it. Here’s my favorite I had. 

Involves an Grandma and myself, dig_dugg3r.

GMA: I HAVE BEEN A CUSTOMER FOR XX YEARS AND I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM UNTIL NOW! UR EMAIL SUCKS AND IS BROKEN. FIX IT. 

Me: I am sorry about that let me pull up the account. 

We go through the verification, everything’s looking good, I finally get to ask the infamous.

Me: So what exactly is going on (while the system loads up. 

GMA: MY EMAIL ISNT WORKING. FIX ITTTT!!!

Me: Alright! We can knock this out and get it working again. 

I check the connection all looks good, so we set up a remote connection. We get in. I see she has the default YOU GOT WREKT screen about resetting the account. We change out her email, and she’s incredibly mad throwing everything at me and all the “You people don’t care about us customers” and the “No, idiot”, “Well y’all provide internet so your the reason my account isn’t secure!”. 

Finally I get her logged in on the remote session and she has 13 total emails, and only three unopened and she grabs the mouse and starts a clickin away, complaining about it loading. 

The email finally loads and it’s a whole bunch of photos of a woman and her new baby just given birth, and she starts sobbing and apologizing and I’m a little like what is going on. 

GMA: Since Covid, I haven’t been able to see my first grand daughter, because I live far away and don’t know how to work technology and if I leave I could get the baby sick or get sick. This is the only way I get to see her grow up until this is over.

So I got to enjoy the baby pictures as I closed the ticket up. She was so happy. 

Anyway, thanks for it all, will keep lurking. Good luck with the screamers, because every now and then you really help someone.",85,0,1
So the cable guy is going to be late?,"So this happened a long time ago well before I was a seasoned IT administrator all the way back in the year 1997. I know it was the summer of 1997 since I was working the phones during the week of famous Tyson vs. Holyfield fight; which would later be known as the Bit Fight.

I had a summer job working for a company that was a support phone bank for COX cable. The pay was ok, if I remember correctly it was like $9 an hour which at the time was pretty good for a freshmen in high school.

The building I worked at was about an hour east of Cleveland on the second floor of a bland building in the warehouse district of a city next to the town I lived in. It was pretty dingy; just rows of cubicles with supervisors at the end of each row to keep the phone plebs in line.

The job consisted of taking phone calls from COX cable customers. All the phone calls were from Michigan; specifically many were from Detroit.

The support requests ranged from new cable service, cancel service, add features and channels, remove features and channels, or add Pay Per View events.

So being that most of my clientele was from Detroit can you guess what the call was about 90% of the time? ... If you guessed it was assisting the customer understand that there cable TV stopped working because they had an overdue balance you are dead right.

Needless to say it was not a fun job, lots of I-Rate customers from inner-city Detroit that just wanted there cable TV back on and they did not want to pay the $197 overdue balance.

Anyways there was an incident that happened to one of my co-workers one day. And it went something like this:

\------------------------------------------------------------------

Cox Cable Support: This is Brian with COX cable customer support how can I help you?

Customer: I'm not actually a COX cable customer; I am calling on behalf of my neighbor who is a customer.

Brian: Ok, did you want to sign up for COX cable service?

Customer: No, I am actually calling just to let you know that there has been an incident. I overheard an argument with one of your cable tech's and my neighbor in the next apartment.  Apparently his cable is being disconnected at the pole for non-payment or something like that. After some argument your cable tech was working on the pole in front of the apartment and my neighbor came outside with a revolver and shot the cable tech in the leg. I just wanted to call you guys and let you know that your cable tech is going to be late for this next appointment.

\----------------------------------------------------------------

I was told we then advised the concerned citizen to call 911.

P.S. Here is something interesting I just remembered.

A customer in upstate Michigan a few hours outside of Detroit could be weeks late on their cable bill and not be disconnected; a person in Detroit however, if they are late more then three days their cable would get shut off.

You see it all came down to economics; fact of the matter was COX was much more likely to still get paid from someone outside the city. The only way they were likely to see any money from people in the city was for them to call in and be forced to pay because there cable was disconnected.",606,0,1
Are you spying on me!,"So a little background: I work for a higher education IT department and often deal with students, professors, and staff members. This particular incident involved a very pissed off professor and his issued laptop.

H: Hi thank you for calling IT support my name is H. How may I assist you?

P: Yeah an icon has appeared on my desktop and I don’t know what it is and it won’t let me drag it to the trash bin. 

H: Oh okay sir, when you say it’s not allowing you to drag it, what do you mean by that?

P: Well it’s asking for administrator credentials in order to delete it and I don’t have those. Can you just remote in?

H: *remotes in* Ah okay I see now. It’s our systems management software that we use to keep track of our inventory and other information regarding our devices.

P:  I don’t care what it does can you just remove it? 

H: No I sir I cannot as we need to need it to keep tabs on our devices. 

P: YOU PPL NEED TO STOP SPYING ON US. IT WAS ONE THING WHEN YOU COULD REMOTE CONTROL OUR COMPUTERS BUT THIS IS A STEP TOO FAR BLAH BLAH BLAH... I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHY YOU WOULD EVEN NEED THIS TYPE OF SOFTWARE

H: *waits for tirade to be over* Okay sir: 1) we need this software to keep track of inventory and to check on the diagnostics of OUR devices 2) this is not your laptop it belongs to my department and it is a privilege to have it and 3) we used this software earlier this week to get the serial number off of a stolen laptop so we could fill out a police report.

What do you mean it's GONE?,"LTL, FTP etc.

I work in a small company distributing ERP system, that is developed by $BigCompany, and provide support regarding this ERP system.

One day I receive a call from $User that didn't buy system from us but from $OtherFirm. It was small company with 5 users of this software.

**$User**

&gt;**$User**: Hello I am calling from $Company, we are using ERP system that you are selling, it doesn't work and $OtherFirm that provides support for us regarding this software doesn't return our calls and e-mails for 2 days and we need to get it working ASAP.

*$BigCompany has rules regarding after-sale support, all we can do is provide diagnosis, but we can help only if the issue is not related to the $BigCompany's software (f.e.: Network issue), if their regular firm doesn't want/can't help them with ERP system $User can report it to the $BigCompany and they can change after-sale supporting firm after confirming with current firm that there is no payment issues between current firm and $User.*

&gt;**$User**: We don't have a password for it. $OtherFirm does, **WE RENT IT FROM THEM**.

&gt;**$Me**: Well you need to get a hold on them and recover password or at least get a database file from it.

&gt;**$User**: We can access files on it from other computers we have mapped disk on all of them to store files, we cannot open these files too.

After looking into mapped disk:

"Laptops, lies, and idiots","This takes place at a non-profit with 100M annual budget.

The players: 

Boss: A very patient and technically astute IT manager with an MBA. Knows his way around tech and office politics.

OverBoss: Made his fortune with insider trading, thinks his shit doesn't stink, does a lot of ""work from home"" where the rest of the department isn't allowed.

PM: The project manager who magically also gets to work from home. I've yet to see a project he's completed.

Me: Your murderous systems engineer anti-hero.

SITREP: Company must encrypt all finance laptops by a certain date. 

As a non-profit we have a LOT of Windows licensing gifted by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation through Microsoft in a marketing-for-software trade. I'll guarantee you've seen our ads.

The PM gets this project in hand in the spring. It's now the fall and Boss has just been informed of the project. All laptops are running Win7 Pro. We have a month to do acceptance testing, plan, deploy, and complete thirty-eight or so laptops.

What gets handed off to me is how we do it.

Bitlocker? Overboss says it doesn't meet the required encryption specification. 

Veracrypt/truecrypt? No, Overboss wants centralized control and ""truecrypt hasn't been tested"".

Third party? Sure, look into that. Which I do asking our CDW rep for pricing for 40 endpoints for two different packages. And CDW rep tells me the waste of a PM has already requested such - and never bothered to tell our mutual boss this.

Upgrade to Win7 Enterprise? I rejected that because bitlocker was out.

Upgrade to Win10? If bitlocker's out it buys us nothing. And Finance has had a laptop to test Win10 with their application stack for two months on a separate project and hasn't reported anything back.

Two weeks to go. Word come down from on high: We're going to upgrade these laptops to Win 7 ENTERPRISE and use bitlocker.

Wait, what? I thought bitlocker was unacceptable! ""I never said that,"" the Overboss says. I email him where he fucking well did, and update my resume.

No testing, we're out of time. We start deploying one at a time because why the fuck not?

It's slow - and while 'slow is not a metric' there's no way to make it through the entire breadth of the project in time. We're talking the first laptop we brought in took six hours. We don't have enough loaners to cover more than four at a time anyway. The end users whose laptops are being upgraded are popping their heads in every thirty minutes.

Behold, this conversation on encrypting laptops that was decided to be done over my objections by way of an unsupported upgrade path from Win7 Pro to Win10 enterprise...

Me: We have thirty-eight laptops to upgrade, each of which will take three hours if the upgrade works and eight if it fails back.

OverBoss: That's too long. I told the CFO it takes two hours per laptop.

Me: I don't know where you got that number. I've never said it would take two hours. I told you three hours *if everything goes right* **and** we can expect a five-to-ten percent failure rate based on my experience of upgrades in place on Windows machines. And this presumes we're not backing up the laptops before the upgrades, which we're not because there's no time.

OverBoss: What are the chances we'll get it done by the deadline?

Me: Zero. There is **no way** this will get done in two weeks.

OverBoss: What can we do?

Me: Move the deadline.

OverBoss: That's unacceptable.

Me: (after a three second pause or avoid flinging obscenities) I don't know what you want to hear. There is no chance this will get done in two weeks.

"When the Sales Manager tries to ""Techsplain"" to the engineer","This one happened to me this morning. I was given a job to configure a customer's well known brand name PBX for SIP which was being provided by a 3rd party vendor. The customer currently had PRI. This also included adding new licenses for said SIP(This will be important in a bit). Nothing too complicated you'd think.

Then the engineer from 3rd party SIP provider arrives and I ask him to provide the information I require to configure the SIP profile on the PBX. It was only then that I found out that the 3rd party was in fact installing a gateway device that would convert the SIP to PRI so essentially I had nothing to do.


Now I'm thinking why have we included so many SIP trunk licenses, which aren't exactly cheap, when they won't even be used? Queue the following conversation between me (OP) and our Sales Manager (SM):

OP: Hey SM you know that SIP config job I'm on? It turns out they're using a gateway which will convert the SIP to PRI so there is no SIP config to be done on the PBX. What should I tell the customer when he asks about the licenses you sold him that are completely redundant?

SM: Nothing. Those licenses will be required in future when ISDN goes off.

OP: ????? Thinking to myself, "" You do realise that the customer's ISDN is being replaced now and the PBX won't know any different?""

OP: No problem SM! 🤦‍♂️


So of course I ended up having to tell some bullsh*t to the customer when he inevitably asked about those licenses. And I basically wasted a whole morning sitting in the customer's office twiddling my thumbs.

I've got so many more storys about our Sales team I could write for days.

But the other guy fixed it faster,"So yesterday was quite the day. I was checking astrology signs. The moon. How the ocean was swaying. I genuinely could not find a reason why everyone was such a pain yesterday. And this call was just the finisher to the day that made me glad it was the last.

Introduction :

All of us live pretty close together and we all met up at YC's place this time.

YC and OC wanted to play a game together on their laptops, but OC mentions something about a problem with their laptop. Something about data not being saved and asks me if I maybe could do something about it.

I tried for myself, made some file on the desktop, restarted the thing *that took forever* and low and behold, the desktop was like out of factory... with a couple utility programs sprinkled in seemingly out of nowwhere. Also what caught my attention was Windows' ""The administrator of your device set the...."" notification. It was definitely new, this device wasn't domained, I logged in as Administrator too. But I shrugged it off for the time being.

I saw a similiar thing years before on YC's Android Tablet. After a year or so the thing stopped saving data. After some time it would restart and all your new data was gone. Turned out to be a CPU issue or something, which made sense why it restarted. The RAM filled up and the system died.

Since this laptop never restarted on it's own, or so I was told, I didn't think much about the CPU being faulty.



First attempt :

Saving happens to hard drive. Maybe it's bad?

My first shot was CrystalDiskInfo but surprisingly to me it didn't find any errors. I should've suspected something at this point, but I was stubborn and kept going in the same direction. I turned to the good old chkdsk and wasted hours on it. My lack of experience in using this tool really showed there. I was making a mistake after another and the HDD was 2TB so scanning took a lot of time. It did turn up some really minor things and it weirded me out even more. They said something about a link to a missing file.

&gt; Strange, these shouldn't cause any of this..

And sure enough - after finally letting chkdsk remove or otherwise deal with them the issue persisted.

Defeated, I handed the laptop back and we went on. I was too tired to Google stuff at this point.



The second coming :

The next day. YC calls me to come over. His data is supposedly gone, desktop is like factory, he can't save a thing.

&gt; This sounds familiar..

And sure enough, it was the same thing. Even down to the Windows notification. Out of ideas I did what I should've in the first place, asked our dear Uncle Google about it. This method quickly turned up a thread on Microsoft Forums about an account doing just that, with ""Make a new account"" listed as the solution. Sounds like Windows 10!

After minutes of trying to figure out how do you create an user without my beloved lusrmgr.msc *it's a basic thing, I know, but this tool should be made essential*, I finally end up with a new user. I get through OOBE, make a file and reboot. A very suspenseful reebot and logon time later, success! The file is still there. I tested it a couple times and it worked. I also brought back the files from the previous account.

Excited, I call OC and ask if he can come too, because I know how to fix his laptop. He was free and showed up, and 10 minutes later he also had a new, working account with all the previously gone data now accessible again.

It may not be the best or only solution, but it fixed the issue. For now anyway.


TL;DR :

Cousins' Windows 10 laptops break in the exact same way. It turns out to be a problem with profiles, instead of my initial suspect, the hard drive. Making a new profile solved their problem.",97,0,1
I just wanted a vodka and coke,"Another tale of a time I've found myself giving IT support in a very random situation. My last post for those who remember it reminded me of this situation. My last post was why it's bad to mention you work in IT, this is why it can be good.

This was a few years ago when I was 18 or 19. I was at a fairly busy local pub having drinks with a friend. It was quite late in the evening and I was fairly tipsy.

I go to the bar with my friend, and ask for two double vodka &amp; cokes. I was told by the young woman behind the bar sheepishly, she can't put it through at the moment as the till is frozen and she's waiting for the manager to turn up to fix it for her.

I say jokingly ""I work in IT, want me to take a look?"" Fully expecting her to laugh it off and not allow a drunk stranger access to their point of sale system.

Immediately after I speak the manager turns up, he looks at the till screen confused, I see him tap the screen a lot while I patiently wait for my drink. I can see the bartender and manager talking for a moment.

The bartender points at me and I overhear ""that guy says he can work in IT, maybe he can help"".

The manager's eyes light up. He approaches me and asks me to come behind the bar, internally I'm laughing because I know I'm getting free drinks out of this.

Manager: ""the till is frozen, [bartender] says you know computers? Do you think you can help?""

Me: ""yeah sure I'll take a look""

I look at the till, it's android based and there was an app open which looked like she sort of point of sale administration app (as opposed to a till app), it seemed to respond to input so wasn't actually frozen, but apparently it was the wrong app and they didn't know how to get out of it. I noticed the back, home and recent apps was missing from the bottom of the screen.

In my mind I think ""it's a (Linux) system, I know this"". I swipe upwards from the bottom of the screen and the buttons appear. I press the home button, then the bartender opens up the correct app.

Bartender: ""how did you do that?!""

I demonstrate to her and the manager what I did, then go back to my friend on the other side of the bar. Two double vodka and cokes appear in front of us and the manager thanks me. I continue with my evening. Once my drink was empty, the bartender dropped off another free double vodka and coke on my table. I felt it was a very satisfying evening.",2782,0,1
That time a government agency surprised me with their stupidity (which isn't easy),"First of all, this might not be a tech support story, strictly speaking, since I work as a developer, and it happened during the supporting phase of one of our finished projects. Close enough, I guess.

A little backstory: I work as a mid-level developer for a web development company, we develop all kinds of web-based applications, and we do a TON of work for government agencies (as it happened this time as well).

So, we were developing a portal plus CMS for a govt. agency, and as part of the system they could manage various country regions, and assign detailed info pages to them with customizable content and title, among other things. The catch is that each region could be assigned to only one info page, because we needed to be able to provide direct links to each region's page (if there is one). By the way, the customizable title is entirely redundant, as they name each info page after the region itself anyway, but hey, what the customer wants, gets.

Development completed, project released, we've entered the support period. After a couple months, the project manager informs me that an error report has been received from the live application for this project. Now, receiving error reports from the production environment already make me slightly annoyed, because I, as a mid-level developer, have no full access to the production environment, and if the error is not reproducible on our test environment, then 95% of the time I can't do anything, and have to instruct the PM to bother someone who does have access to the production server. Most of the time the culprit turns out to be some problem with the server configuration, which has nothing to do with me. But not this time, oh no!

So we've received this error report from the live CMS, and the usual convo began: (PM - Project Manager, Me - Well.. me.)  
PM: Hey, an error report came from the live CMS for X project  
Me: What's the problem?  
PM: They can't select region 'A' when creating an info page, it's not in the dropdown  
Me: Have they checked if that region has already been selected for an info page?  
PM: Yes, but it wasn't.  
Me: Hm, let's have a look... Hm, looks like it really cannot be selected, and I don't see it listed among the existing pages either.... \*I try to reproduce the error on our test environment, without success\* Eh, it seems like I can't bring this error out on our test server.  
PM: So... What can we do?  
Me: You'll have to ask someone who has full access to the production server, because I can't do anything... Unless... No, they can't be THAT stupid

Yes. They were exactly that stupid. I've opened the edit form for one of the info pages, and although the info page was titled ""region B"", the selected region was, in fact, region A. Then I checked the rest as well, info page ""region C"" had region D selected, and info page ""region D"" had region B selected. These guys failed at writing the correct title for the correct region, and then went and sent us an error report.

So what was my fix? I've added a column containing the name of the selected region as well as the custom title to the list view of the info pages, so they can see very well the mess they've created, sent through a merge request for my ""fix"", and asked the PM to kindly tell the client that they are bloody idiots. Haven't heard of them since.",249,0,1
Government employees are lazy,"A tale of how I learned just how lazy government employees are. Also don't cc your boss if you're in the wrong.

So before we start, a bit of background. I used to be a field technician in the screen printing and digital printing field. My job consisted of installing machines, training customers on said equipment, and doing phone support and field repairs. For anyone who has done tech work for an extended period of time, you know that 90% of the issues that pop up, you have seen before, and thus know the cause from a couple questions. The other 10% are the fun ones where you get to actually get down and dirty and possibly experience and learn something new. Sadly this tale is one of the 90%.

Now, these large format digital printers have a nifty feature where you can print out something, take it off the machine, laminate it on a different machine, then feed it back into the original printer where it will proceed to kiss cut your design. This is used mainly for stickers or large decals. The way this works is the machine will print out registration marks and then reads them in when the material is fed back in for cutting. There is a sensor that reads these marks. Sometimes scraps of vinyl (material) gets caught and sticks to the machine covering the sensor.

With that long intro out of the way, onto the story.

$me - me

$boss - my boss

$cust - government employee. This dude is my main contact. Usually nice, but very impatient.

$cb - $cust's boss

So it has been busy. I was over at $cust the previous week doing a repair. It went smoothly. I had completely cleaned and calibrated the machine. Most importantly I had checked the sensor because the repair I did affected the alignment of the print-feed-cut feature. This is important because I actually showed $cust the calibration as part of the repair. It worked.

Anyway, I have been busy. Talking about 38hrs in the field of a 40hr work week. I have been in the office very spares the whole week. I get an email from our phone system and download the file to listen. It's $cust.

$cust: Hey you need to call me now! Our machine is down it won't read the registration marks you were just out here and broke our machine blah blah blah.

Not a a minute after the voicemail I get an email from $cust saying that I need to get out ASAP cause I broke the machine.

\[BEGIN EMAIL EXCHANGE\]

$me: Hey $cust, I got your voicemail and your email. Can you describe exactly what's going on?

$cust1: It's not working! You broke it! Get out here now!

\[END EMAIL EXCHANGE\]

I have a rule: If you are not specific in your description you get bumped to the bottom of the queue. So that's what I did. Next day I come into the office.

\[BEGIN EMAIL EXCHANGE\]

$me: Hey $cust, can you be more specific? Are there any error codes that come up?

$cust: Yeah the error is &lt;code&gt;. When are you getting out here?

$me: Hi $cust, from that error code the problem is the sensor is not seeing the markings. The quickest thing we can do to solve this problem is to make sure the sensor is not blocked. Please double check that sensor is not covered in stray vinyl. \*attach pictures showing him where to look\*

$cust: This machine was working just last week! I need you out here now cause you broke it! \*He cc's $cb. Big mistake as I take extensive notes of all my field repairs.\*

$me: Hi $cust. When I did the repair last week I calibrated and tested the alignment of the sensor. This was done right in front of you and I have your signature signing off that the repair and calibrations were completed and working. I will be happy to go out there at my next available time which is next week, but in the meantime, I ask that you check to make sure the sensor is not blocked as that is the most common cause. Also, if I do go out there and it is not a defect in my work, we charge a 2 hour minimum. \*I cc $cb and $boss so that $boss is in the loop and knows what to expect\*

$cust: I already did! This is unacceptable! Get out here as soon as you can because we are down until you fix it!

\[END EMAIL EXCHANGE\]

I don't reply back because screw that shit. A week goes by and I go onsite. I bring with me a copy of the work order that he signed off on stating that the machine was working when I left as well as a copy of the emails and pictures I sent him. When I get there I am greeted by both $cust and $cb.

$cb: Let's hurry this up so we can get back to work.

This is going to be fun. I step up to the machine and the first thing I do is open it up and look at the sensor. Yep. It was blocked. There was about 3 layers of little vinyl pieces covering the sensor. I show $cb and $cust.

$me: Like I said in my email, this issue is most likely caused by a blocked sensor. I thought you said you checked it? \*I hand over a copy of the email with that portion highlighted\*

$cb: So you're telling me we lost a week of production and it could have been preventable if $cust had done what you said?

$me: Yup.

I hand over the work order and invoice for this visit to $cust to sign off on, but $cb takes it instead and signs off on it.

$cb: Thank you for your help on this $me. You have a good day. $cust, my office. Now.

This was the last repair in a long string of repairs so I took an extra long paid lunch (2hr minimum for a 20min call out). Moral of the story, if a tech has 15+ years of experience, maybe listen to them. Also, don't try to fuck with me by cc'ing your boss. Techs are really good at CYA and will make you hurt.

My printer is missing,"Hey fellas,

&amp;#x200B;

this just happened moments ago and it made my day, so I wanted to share this gem with you.  
Cast:  
Me: obvious  
HDG: HelpDeskGuy, just finished his training to become a full scale system engineer  
User: Not so tech savy user, but quite nice and with a good sense of humor

&amp;#x200B;

The whole story starts a few days ago, when a ticket from User pops up in our system.  
The ticket reads like 'I want to print out of our ERP to my PDF-printer, but it does not show in the dialog, only some obscure WebEx-printer'  
As this is a quite easy task, I ignored the ticket to be handled by our help desk, despite I am technically responsible for the ERP-software.

To have a short description of the setup, the software is installed on one of our servers and the users get a RemoteApp-link on their desktop to login. The users log to their desktop via Citrix from home due to the Covid19-HomeOffice-Policies we have implemented.

So HDG gets the ticket and calls User. Maybe the printer has been lost somewhere in the way of the connection from her laptop via Citrix to the RDP-connection. Easy task, reinstall the PDF-software an the Citrix-session and go on. 

But after the first document, the User drop another note to the ticket 'Printer gone again'.

So HDG asks me for help, as I've setup the software in the first place and created the rdp-files. But there is no misconfiguration to be seen. Printers are redirected from the Citrix session to the RemoteApp and even in the software's own settings everything looks fine. I tell HDG my findings and forget about this ticket.

Fast forward a week to today. HDG calls me, asking for help again, as this problem still exists. So I call User to have a look myself. She opens ERP, selects her document and opens the print preview. In this view she clicks on the 'Print' button. And I see the issue. 

User is right, the dialog shows only the WebExPrinter, but what both, User and HDG, missed, was the scrollbar right below. So I asked for control, scrolled the bar to the left and magically all her printers appeared. You could hear the face palm through the phone. We had a short laugh and I called HDG to tell him, what the issue has been. 

Buddy, you owe me a beer ;)

User: Can i call you to discuss my phone?

Me: Good morning user, i would prefer if this was written so it protects both of us and we have it in writing for both our records, whats going on?

User: i need this done quick! Like before the end of the day (details several things)

Me: well we can do all that (X ) takes about 4 hours and you need to be available in that 4 hours but you have to do (Y ) first and once done we have to complete X within 14 days. And it best if we do it before noon just in case there are issues, so we have the full day to fix them. I dont want to leave you without service if something breaks during the process and we have left for the day.

User: So I can get a new phone TODAY?

Me: well first you need to do Y so we can get X done, and once those are done you can request a phone, then if you are approved for a phone we can order you one.

User: so do Y today

Me: do Y when ever you are ready to kick off the 14 days we have to complete X

User: WHAT? WHAT 14 DAYS YOU SAID 4 HOURS!

Me: (Copy and pasted) (X ) takes about 4 hours and you need to be available in that 4 hours but you have to do (Y ) first and once done we have to complete X within 14 days. And its best if we do it before noon just incase there are issues we have the full day to fix them. I dont want to leave you without service if something breaks during the process and we have left for the day.

User: okay its done can we get this done today? I need it done RIGHT NOW!

Me: Thats not going to be possible, we need to start it before noon because if there are issues it might actually be a whole day thing if something breaks and it is 12:50 right now. We can complete X tomorrow if you do Y today

User: Y is done! So i can get a new phone tomorrow. 

Me: You can request one, I need your account info to check eligibility.

User: here it is 

Me: Great news, you are eligible for a new phone you can request it here.

User: What we only have iPhone 7s?

Me: No, you should see other options there under the device request drop down (by default the space is empty so I know he is looking at the drop down menu) 

User: 64GB? I need more than that but I definitely need the 10 not the XR. The 10 is the most advanced phone after the 11. Why can't we atleast get that?

Me: as stated on the form, you have a $150 allowance, and you should see other models within that price range with higher storage amounts. This includes the iPhone SE 2020 which has the tech of the iPhone 11 and came out earlier this year.

User: how do i get my allowance upped and whats the cost of the 128GB XR since I have to get that and not the iPhone 10, and whats my employee ID?

Me: your manager needs to send me a business reason why you need to increase spend up to $200 and the 128GB 10 R is 199.99, and be aware I will need to tell him the other options. I am sorry, I do not know your employee id. 

User: its because I need more storage WHAT DON'T YOU GET?

Me: your manager needs to send me his business reasoning why you need it

User: He is just going to send you an email that says its approve thats all you need thats enough

Me: he is going to have to send a business reason or I cannot accept it and I will have to inform him of the other options he has.

(Recieved email from Verizon stating Y was done at 2:45P not when he said it was done at 12:50)

-----in email------

User: Manager please just send that my phone is approved so I can get it before the end of the day

Me: hello manager, please be aware here is what you are being asked to approve, a 128GB iPhone XR for 199.99 and user has expressed that it is because he need more space. Please be aware, here are the other options that have more space including the iPhone SE 2020 128GB at 49.99 and 256GB at 99.99. The SE came out in 2020 and has the tech of the iPhone 11. If you feel we need to incurr this extra cost to the business, please send me a business justification as to why you feel he should have this device since it is outside of the allowance

User: manager, please just approve it or i guess if you can't approve it, i will just have to try to make the 64GB phone work. Also (me), the reason is i need more space and no apps will work on anything but a 11 but I can make them work on a 10! Also, their is no such phone as the iPhone SE its not available for purchase and its not on the request page and it is also not on Apple's website.

Me: (Screen Shot of request page attached) I am sorry user, could you clarify what you mean by there is no such thing as the iPhone SE? Please help me fix any issue with the site, If you are having issues viewing the request page please take a look at the attached screen shot and point out any discrepancies, it should show 3 iPhone SE options 64GB 128GB and 256GB ranging from 0.99 to 99.99. If there are any issue i'll have IT take a look and fix them as soon as possible, so no one else has any problems requesting a phone. And if you mean on the Apple page you can view the iPhone SE by clicking the first advertisement at the top of the Apple page that says iPhone SE or by following this link. (Link to iphone se page) and  you dont need to worry, they are available and in-stock at both Apple and the carrier.

User: there is nothing wrong with the request page. There is no iPhone SE listed as a phone Apple makes, and its not on their site and no iPhone SE comes up when I Google it.

-----in skype------

User: Why did you send that?

User: Why does it matter if they approve or not? Give me a new phone NOW and give me what I want!

Me: Your manager has to know what they are approving since it costs the business and especially since it costs the business more than usual. They also need to know what their alternative options are since this is out of standard and there are standard option that fix your stated issue. It is required by finance to prevent unneeded and frivolous spending.

"""What do you mean my panoramic camera takes panoramic photos?""","Years ago I used to work at a certain drug store chain that has its own in-store photo lab. This probably happened in 2011, and all the way up until 2013, we had what was called a digital minilab in this location, which was a photo processing setup - we had one machine that processed film, and another machine that ~~developed (not printed) photos~~ printed photos by exposing light sensitive paper, both fully automated. It was actually pretty easy to use, and allowed us to provide one-hour photo service for rolls of film. 

One day, a customer came in with a roll of film from his panoramic camera. If you're not familiar with these, they were a type of film camera that came about in the late 90s that would take panoramic - that is, extra wide - photographs. They didn't really take off because this was just before the unstoppable rise of the digital camera, but apparently someone somewhere was still hanging onto one, and I got to process his film this day. I take the film, tell the customer to come back in an hour, and get to work.

I run the film through the film processor. Using this machine involves attaching the end of the film to a leader card that is fed in and pulled along by a series of toothed conveyor belts. The film is taken through a series of chemical baths, exactly as it would be in an old school dark room with professional developers working, but with mechanical precision. The film comes out the other end, and it's ready to go.

I load the film into the photo processor. This photo processor used big rolls of photo paper that was cut to length as needed, and this paper was kept in sealed cartridges to avoid light exposure. There was 6 inch paper for 4x6 prints, 7 inch paper for 5x7, and 8 inch paper for 8x10s, but for this job, it instructed me to load a size we don't use much - 5.3 inches. ""Huh, that's unusual,"" I think to myself as I load the cartridge, and once the photos start coming I can see why it needed this paper - these were panoramic prints! Pretty cool. This customer had seemingly gone on vacation and taken some breathtaking photos of desert landscapes. I was impressed by both the quality and format of these photos, and after some digging through our supply shelves I found the appropriate envelope. ""Boy the customer's going to like these,"" I thought to myself as I placed the order in the pickup bin. Then, he returned.

Me: Here's your photos, sir.    
Customer: What the hell are these?    
Me: What do you mean?    
Customer: These photos. Why did you print them like this?    
Me: These are panoramic photos, that's how they're supposed to be printed.    
Customer: Why?    
Me: This is the kind of photo your camera takes.    
Customer: Well I don't want them like this, I want them as 4x6.    
Me: I can do that sir, but I'll have to crop them down to fit.    
Customer: What?    
Me: This is a wide format photo. It won't fit on a standard print.    
Customer: What are you talking about?    
Me: *I show the customer a sample 4x6 print and compare it to his panoramic print.* See? These photos are much wider, I can't fit them on this print size without losing a lot on one or both sides.    
Customer: Why can't you fit the whole thing?    
Me: It's a different aspect ratio.    
Customer: What does that mean?    
Me: It's... shaped differently. These are longer.    
Customer: You don't know what you're talking about. I want a refund.

All of their headsets aren't working...,"Hello,

A brief one that I've been wanting to share somewhere do figured here was best. I sell used entry level gaming PC's on the side as a way to help people get into the hobby for a small cost.

After selling a few systems, it was usually 24 hours later I'd get a message saying ""hey man, system is great but my microphone (or headphones) isn't working in my headset when I plug it in""

I tested all the ports for all of my systems and yeah, they work. I know this. So I asked if they're using a ""single Jack headset like for an Xbox controller or Phone?"" And always it was yes. Single Jack laptops, I curse you!

Please follow the instructions and listen to the tech,"For some background, I work as a hardware support technician at a major social media company. Part of my job required to image laptops and prep them for new hires. However, because of the pandemic and the stay at home orders mandated in March, we couldn't really do this ourselves. Fast forward to May, and we are still working from home. My company has developed a system where we could image the laptops remotely and the new hire would just have to follow along, I've been doing this for a few months now, and in the time, we have noticed that some users do not follow the instructions given to them upon receiving the laptop, so they try to set it up on their own, and it always backfires for them, because they need our help after all. We normally just help them to reset everything and we walk them through the process properly this time and all is good afterwards. Though, there is one of these users who takes the cake of not following instructions.

I was getting ready to call the user for our morning appointment to setup the laptop. After getting his info and making sure he got the correct device, I ask him to turn it on and connect it to a power source. He then tells me that he was already at the main desktop. I sat there confused on what he was talking about, and then I realized, he setup his company laptop with his personal credentials, even though he has been provided work credentials to use. I facepalmed so hard because not only did he not wait for further instructions, he opened his laptop and just did what he thought he should do. Now, I had to walk him through the factory reset process, which just made this whole process longer than it should. Afterwards, I send him a pdf with instructions and images on what to do, hoping that he would listen this time, and awaited for his response afterwards.

About 30 minutes later, I get a text from him saying that he was at the VPN login page, and his credentials weren't working (When working remotely, the user must connect to a VPN in order to access the network). I asked him to verify the username, and once again, he gave me his personal username. I was starting to get irritated at this point, and I let him know that he has to use his work username and password to log in. Once he did, the imaging began, and I cooled down after, telling him to let me know once the image was completed and I also asked him NOT to do anything afterwards, as I will be walking him towards the process. 

Another 30 minutes go by, and I get another text, saying that the image was completed, and the next step was to get the accounts setup (Outlook, teams, slack, all of that good stuff). Then he tells he that he was trying to setup his outlook and Okta, and his password didn't work. Apparently, he setup a lot of password for his apps, including the computer password and that they weren't working. Great, now at this point, I was pretty furious, now that we had to take even longer to get this completed, but I did my best not to show it, and just walked him through everything once more. I had to reset all of his password, and ensure all we're working. I had to remind this guy why it was important that he should've waited for instructions, because instead of taking an hour that we could've taken to get this done, it took almost 5 hours complete. The disappointment was real",174,0,1
Venn diagram of networks,"Back story: I have a user who cannot access the network drives with the VPN connected. After 5 minutes of reading notes from the last tech and troubleshooting I find that her home network has the same subnet as the office network, so when she tries to connect the the network drives, it doesn’t work. 

I explain to user the same way I always explain this issue: “your computer is calling the server and something in your network has the same name as the server, but the device in your home answers faster because it is closer.”

Now it’s a lot easier to change the home subnet than the office subnet. So I offer: “I can change the way your network names devices so that we don’t have this issue anymore” 

User says: “my husband takes care of all of that. Here you go.”

Husband: “I work for [ISP] so you can explain it to me”

Me: “So your home subnet and the office subnet are the same, so there is something on your network with the same IP as the server. This means that whatever is on your home network is responding faster than the server and telling [wife]’s computer that it doesn’t have the network drive”

Husband: “okay so you want me to change the subnet?”

Me: “I can do it if you’d prefer, changing your subnet is much easier than changing the office subnet”

Husband: “I’ll do it when I have time. I’m busy right now.”

We hang up. I go back to what I was doing before user called. 

30 minutes later I answer the phone and give my greeting.

Husband: “hey this is [husband]. I just cannot understand how my network is interrupting [wife]’s work. The VPN gives her access to everything”

Me: “yes, the VPN does give her access to everything, but because there is an IP in your network that matches the server’s IP, the device in your network responds faster than the server and says it doesn’t have the network drive she needs”

Husband: “that just doesn’t make sense. I don’t have this problem with my work” 

Me: “I’m not sure how you are set up to work remotely, but I imagine you are not trying to connect to a remote device that has the same IP as a home device”

We go around in a circle for 20-25 minutes. I try to explain that the VPN doesn’t exclude your home network because you might want to print to a local printer.  Before we figure it out.

Me: “The VPN makes a LAN Venn diagram with your wife’s computer in the middle, much like a phone call does. So if I were to say [husbands name that is also the name of a coworker] right now, while on the phone with you, I would hear coworker before I would hear you because the phone call delays the sound a little”

Husband: “that makes sense but I don’t want to change my subnet. I can’t do it on my modem. Can I change where isn’t assigns addresses?”

Me: “yeah, you can start the pool above 100 because we static everything below 100” 

Husband: “I’ll do that tonight”

I learned the next day when user called because she couldn’t access the server (VPN wasn’t connected) that he changed the subnet.

This whole call was crazy to me.",124,0,1

"""Then I will go to every apartment and check""","I work at a fairly small local ISP as a customer support agent. I got a call yesterday from a client claiming that he didn't get the speed he was paying for (1 Gbps). After about 20 minutes of troubleshooting it becomes clear to me that the customer didn't have ANY devices at home that could handle speeds faster than 100 Mbps. I explain this to the customer and he seems to understand this. He then continues to ask if I'm sure there isn't anything wrong with our core-switch in the area about 6 times in as many minutes. I explain that even if there where something wrong with it, we really couldn't check that before he tested his speed with something that could handle 1 Gbps. He finally seems to  realize this and ends the call.

20 minutes later he calls again, this time because he has gone to a neighbor to check what speed he gets there, and he still only reaches about 100 Mbps. He therefore believes that I was lying to him about the core-switch and more or less demands that we come an exchange it for a new one. Once again I explain that just because another customer in the same area has a problem similar to him we can't exchange the core-switch because it's too expensive. I tell him that his problem is on his end and that it mean nothing since he can't know if he gets more than 100 Mbps, and that if his neighbor has problems he is welcome to give us a call since we can't troubleshoot something with a customers neighbor. 

After about 20 minutes of this I start to get really irritated and say that we can't do anything more at the time and that I unfortunately have to end the call because there was a call-queue (there wasn't but i was getting really sick of him). His answer to that is as follows:

""Okay, then I will go around to every apartment in the area that I can get access to and check if they get the speeds they are paying for"".

I simply say ""You do that"" and then say bye and hang up.

When your user is younger than their computer,"So I'm a newlywed. While I love my in-laws to death, they definitely have their quirks.

On the family vacation I'm now a part of, I was tasked with getting a laptop ready for a cousin I'd acquired in the marriage. It was a work laptop my new gandfather had used, and they'd let him keep it when he left. I'm a fresh engineering graduate with a knack for electronics from the metal to the code, so I probably was the best choice for the task to be fair.

There's no easy way to put it; it was old. 3GB of ram, 60 GB of storage, and an Intel Duo CPU - we're talking about a decade and change old.

The part that makes it better, and yet so much worse, is that it was actually older than the cousin who was going to be getting it. On one hand, it's not like it'll be expected to record and livestream AAA games. On the other hand, *the computer was older than the person using it*.

Anyway, I just needed to get that off my chest. It took me three days of checking in on it to install Windows 10 (it had 7), install Firefox (to prevent them from installing Chrome), and run tronscript (make sure no bloatware came with the new install).

$me: me, duh  
$owner: the owner of a small restaurant

So one day I was working at home because I had to pick up a package at the post office. I decided to go around lunch time so I can go pick up some take-out on the way back. This way I wouldn't have to cook - killing two birds with one stone, right?

Walking in to a small restaurant I noticed that it was quite empty. Splendid, that meant I wouldn't have to wait and could be on my way in no time. As I was walking up to the counter ready to order my food the owner from behind the counter hinted at me

&gt;$owner: You're young, you must be good with computers, right?

&gt;$me working in IT for a sizeable company not wanting to get myself in a buttload of unpaid work: I guess I know how to use one.

&gt;$owner: I just got this new laptop and apparently you have to set it up to use it. I don't know much about computers, I just have to get it up and running so I can do some accounting stuff for my restaurant.

This was already in the Windows 10 times, so setting up the computer should be an easy task.

&gt;$me: You just have to read the instructions and click a few buttons, it's no big deal. I'm sure you can manage.

&gt;$owner: I really don't know much about computers, could you not take a few moments to set it up?

$me being a nice guy, I agreed. I am walked over to the table escorted by $owner bringing the food I had managed to order by this time. A few moments later $owner brings his laptop from the back office and opens it up. As usual the 'set-up' screen shows and we are greeted by Cortana screaming at us in a volume that also notified the construction workers outside to what was going on inside.

After the mandatory butchering of Cortana I walked $owner through the process and advised him to disable all tracking options, etc. A quick 15 minutes or so later I had finished my food and the laptop was set up. $owner thanked me and offered the meal on the house.

In the end I probably saved $owner a few bucks because he would probably have gotten someone to set it up for him, and I got a free meal out of it - a classic win-win.",2096,0,1
More of being on-site (i.e. home) tech support.,"This was actually yesterday at my house.  Like I said in my previous post, my husband isn't really computer savvy. (He actually worked in a hospital before he retired, and did have to use a computer to enter vitals at times, so he wasn't that bad.)

My previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/hxxofg/once\_an\_it\_worker\_forever\_tech\_support/](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/hxxofg/once_an_it_worker_forever_tech_support/)

So, my husband has to go on a trip out of state, and had to do his bookings (flight, car rental, and hotel room) on a popular travel site. Before, he let me do the arrangements because I am more comfortable doing online ordering. But this time, he decided to do it himself.  Well, he came to me yesterday at told me he couldn't find the confirmations for everything that he booked.  Well, in this case, I had to go on his laptop in order to track down the problem.  (Before, I would use my desktop system to do all this.)

Once I got on his laptop and navigated to the travel site, I managed to figure out what he had done.  Usually, you would have to enter your e-mail address to the site (as a user name) and create a password (so you can access the bookings in case you have to make a change.) What he had done was put in his e-mail address then put in his password ON THE SAME DAMN LINE! Fortunately I was able to manage to get in and pull up all the bookings (and eliminate a double booking for a rental car that he had made,) and then print out all the confirmations for him, and send them to his proper e-mail address as a backup.

Afterwards, I asked him ""Are you trying to give me a f@%&amp;ing aneurysm?"" His reply: ""Now you see why I keep you around?""  I love my husband, but sometimes he drives me nuts.",144,0,1

"Once an IT worker, forever tech support.","It's been almost 20 years since I was an IT grunt, (I worked in a large computer center being back-end support, meaning I did it all. Monitoring mainframe, mid-range, Unix/Linux, Windows Server, and Netware systems. Tape jockey on 3480-compatible tape drives, and print operations.)   


I had met my boyfriend (now my husband) while I was still working this job.  This was back in the days of dial-up.  He and I had started dating and he and I used to spend weekends together.  Well, he had a very nice  Pentium III setup from a manufacturer that used to ship their systems  out in Holstein-spotted boxes.  The first time I spent time at his  place, I asked if I could use his computer to check my e-mail.  (I was  working in IT at the time and would have to check my work mail.) This  was the days when Windows 98 had taken off in a big way.  So I power up  his system, and it went immediately into ScanDisk.  I asked him how  often this happened, and he said ""Every time I power it up.""  Now, one  of the reasons that it would do that was if the power was interrupted  while Win 98 was running.  I asked him, ""How do you shut your computer  off?""  He told me that he just pushed in and held the power button until  the computer powered off.  I had to tell him that to shut the computer  down, he had to go to the Start button and select Shut Down from the  menu.

"Say ""I"" and state your name; or, an Exercise in Not Doing Doing a Spit Take on the Phone","I work in deskside faculty and staff support for Large University (LU). Unlike many tech support positions, my team is very much ""ground troops,"" we spend most of our time not at desks but walking around outside in the blistering heat as we support buildings on all corners of the campus and we operate primarily as in person support. We were, previously, so focused on in-person support that up until a few months ago, our remote support capabilities were limited to on-prem Microsoft Remote Desktop. Obviously, with the Rona, we'e been forced to change our tune a bit.

Everyone at LU has a Username. This Username is generated when you're hired, and connects you to every resource at LU, including your payroll, email, AD login, and etc. Your email is, technically, username@lu.edu, but because those usernames are not easy to remember, everyone also has and primarily uses a firstname.lastname@lu.edu email address. These firstname.lastname addresses are technically only aliases of the Username address.

All of our phones are run through...let's just call it Scoop for Enterprise. Scoop is tied into our AD, but it is *not tied into the email system.* The important thing to know is that while Scoop understands that your email is connected to your Username, it doesn't understand that the firstname.lastname and the Username email addresses are the same person. If our Scoop team has created your Scoop account with your firstname.lastname email and you try to login with your username email, it will get as far as bringing up our LU enterprise login and letting your put in your LU username &amp; password before telling you you don't exist.

This system is unnecessarily and complicated and while the scoop team almost *always* creates accounts based on the firstname.lastname email, it does vary enough to make the system overly labyrinthine for the end user.

A few weeks ago I (Computer Doctor, henceforth CD) picked up a ticket for Kindly Professor (KP). The paitent, an old PearBook, presented symptoms of slowness and being horribly out of date, so the paitent was reimaged. After the device was return to the client, I received an email from Kindly Professor asking for assistance signing into Scoop. We enter his firstname.lastname email, he entered his LU creds into the LU sign in, and we were greeted with a message that he did not exist. Some clients really *don't* exist, so I told him I would confirm with the Scoop team and let him know.

A few days later, this is the phone conversation that followed.

$CD: Hi Dr. KP, this Computer Doctor from LU. I've spoken to our Scoop team, and determined that your Scoop account is probably tied into your username@lu email instead of your firstname.lastname@lu email. *Try putting your username @ lu.edu in the email field*, and see if it lets you in.  
$KP: What password is this? My LU password?  
$CD: Yes, should be.  
$KP: It's not letting me in. It's saying ""wrong password.""  
$CD, already sure KP is typing the wrong thing into the wrong window: Okay, why don't we start a remote support session so I can see what's going on?  
*KP laughs. He seems...offended; as if he takes umbrage at the concept that he might be doing something wrong. I, meanwhile, have no doubt he is; Scoop presents two simultaneous sign on windows which look completely different on different OSes and want slightly different variations of the same info; this is almost impossible to explain over the phone.*  
$KP: Okay but what do I put here? My LU username and password?  
$CD: Yes, it should be. If it doesn't work you may want to remove the @lu.edu from after your Username.  
$KP: It still won't let me in.  
*I am wracking my brain. He must, I think, be putting the wrong info into the wrong fields.*  
$CD: Okay, let's start a remote support session so I can see what you're seeing.

The remote support session is started. ""You have a new session in queue!"" my support tool happily informs me. I hold my breath. I open the session. Slowly, the screen of KP's pearbook comes into view.

Folks, I had a lot of theories on what KP was doing. Wrong password, wrong field, wrong email. In all the theories I had, I had not even conceived of what he had actually done. Into the email field, he has typed yourusername@lu.edu. No, I do not mean his username. I mean, verbatim. The email in the field, letter for letter, is ""yourusername@lu.edu.""

I am forced to sit, barely avoiding hysterics, as the client clicks ""sign in"" and attempts to sign in as someone named yourusername. He is, shockingly, unable.

$CD: Okay, why don't we try this?  
*I remove ""yourusername"" and replace it with...his username, which I have at this point memorized. He signs in.*

It works.

I hang up the phone, and then proceed to dissolve into hysterics.

I am CCIE and will not follow your moronic script feom some idiot support monkey!!!!,"Sorry so long, but it is worth it.

Okay, so several years ago I was working as a senior support rep, AKA Supervisor, for a third party support company that handled calls for acompany that provided DSL service. Let's call it WellMouth, the company has since been acquired by another one called...BU&amp;U.

So my job was simple, wait for someone to ask for a supervisor, then tame the wild Karen.(Even though the term had not been invented yet.) So I am going through my normal nightly routine of reading web comics, arguing over nerd stuff, and taking escalations. I had a pretty uneventful night, and then one of our front-line reps comes over in tears. She explained that there was some angry IT type guy on the phone, and he flat refused to troubleshoot ANYTHING. (Which was normal) I asked why she was crying, and then she started telling me some of the awful things we said to her. I on most occasions backed our reps if they tried, some didn't, but most were there making $9.00/hr to get yelled at by entitled jerks, and still managed to care about the quality of there work. I told her to transfer him directly to me, and even told her to come listen to the call so she could see how I handled it.

Now, I need to let you know, I had a real reputation of being able to absolutely shut down the worst of the worst. I could tell people they were wrong in a way that made them apologize and thank me for the time. Also the reason I said to directly transfer the call, was if it was being recorded, I wanted this to live on a server for eternity. You see if she transferred the the escalation queue, all recording stopped, but not on direct transfers.

Me: Hello sir you are now on the line with cryptratdaddy, I am a supervisor here at WellMouth, and I understand your DSL service isn't working?

Jerk: Listen here moron, your team of monkeys couldn't troubleshoot your way through pissing your own pants, and you won't put me through some stupid script for things I have already figured out. I am CCIE, do you know what that means you idiot?!?!? I make more in a month building the damn internet you need to look up your answers on the web. now...

This is where I tuned out as I really did not need to know anything else, because while he ranted, I was doing my normal due diligence, you know, checking for DSL service outages, maintenance, and other factors that affect service. This also included the national power grid service alert system. You see we had access to a toll that showed (with a few minute delay) the status of most power grids in the south east United States. 

Now for a quick lesson in US weather patterns. If you have never been to Florida in the summer you might not know that there climate is much like a rain forest. Daily thunderstorms are VERY common. I check the guys address, yup, thunderstorm got the power in like a five mile radius from him. I let him finish his résumé, and when he's done.

Me: Sir you are absolutely right. (He goes silent, and the reps that were listening just went slack jawed.) How dare us expect a man of your skill to fall folly to the mistakes of simpletons. And for us to ask you to start troubleshooting from the basics is truly absurd. I have a much more advanced and out of the box approach that will require our line technicians to get involved, if you would be so kind as to indulge me for a moment. I need to clear it with the team.

Jerk: Sure thing, and thanks for understanding.

 A two minute penalty hold later.

Me: Okay sir, please take your laptop close to the router.

Jerk: Okaaay (shuffling around)...hey...how did you know I had a laptop?

Me: well, sir, Battery backups generally would have run down by now, or been beeping since the power went out in the thunderstorm you are in the middle of, so a laptop would be the only way your computer had power, so I want you to take the first step of troubleshooting and see if there are any lights on the modem.

Me: Sir...sir...hello??? (Line goes dead)

I turned to the rep and said, ""see this man builds the internet, but didn't know his modem needed electricity"". She smiled, and the now eight person audience burst out laughing.

That job was hell, but man I miss the stories.

**Edit:** I forgot to mention for those that don't know CCIE stands for Cisco Certified Internet Expert. It is/was (I haven't cared to keep up with certifications for a while) a very difficult level to achieve, and the over simplification of what they did, was build internet backbones and such.

"A story of Printers, Shadow IT and Corporate Purchasing Policies","  

Hello, welcome to a story of printers, shadow IT and corporate purchasing policies.

I am not an official IT person per say I am however the person delegated as the point of contact for my remote office for our corporate IT. Made the mistake of telling people that I am taking classes fir IT in collage. So 

The story starts when our maintenance guy asks me to trouble shoot his printer. I walk out to the production floor and check wires than sit at his laptop and see that it is connected to the wireless network instead of the Ethernet that is plugged into his laptop. I follow the cable to a Cisco switch hanging on one screw on the wall and cables coming down from the drop ceiling. I notice that one of the link lights are down. This cable is coming from the ceiling and is not labeled. I go to the switch closet look for five minutes throw the rats nest without any luck as none of the cables are labeled.

At this point I put a help ticket desk ticket in and go back to my own work.

After 30 minutes the help desk gives me a call. I am asked if the switch has any labeling as all static IP devices (Printers, Servers, Switches, etc.) should have a label with the IPv4 address on it. After informing him there is not, He goes about pulling up the network diagram. He informs me that there are there are four switches assigned to our office. Three in the server closet, and a forth we are assuming is the down switch. After about 15 minutes we unplug the switch to see if we get any network notifications. We do not. After trying different things, we agree to escalate the ticket. So, I go back to work for the next 30 mins.

When I get a call form Layer 2 and we are doing some basic troubleshooting to see if we missed something the first two times when I notice an Ethernet cable in the ceiling… I plug it into my laptop, and I connect. function facepalm{now}.  I inform the help desk and we plug it into the switch, the link light turns on and nothing. At this point we know we have a working cable we just don’t know what port it is connected to as we have 3 48 port switches all with full ports and cable management that does not exist. 

As we do not have a cable toner there is a slim chance of being able to find the cable. We catch the only break we get as the cable is the only one that color out of the easily 100+ cables in that rats’ nest. L2 looks at the closet switch config and sees that it is set to switchport access. After changing it to trunk mode, and nothing. L2 does some digging and sees that the switch is from a plant that shut down last year. He is unable to SSH into the switch. Therefore, we need to do a fresh config. Only problem is travel is still restricted. So, our solution is to use an employee’s laptop (See office spare from when an employee was assigned 2 by mistake) which will be connected via console cable to switch to which IT will RDP into to configure the mystery switch.

However, we do not have a console cable at the office, and I do not have one at home. Normally you would buy a $5 cable off amazon and it would arrive Monday. However, Amazon does not issue Pos, there for we have to buy the same cable form another place for $17 with $7 shipping and it will arrive in 5-10 business days. So here we sit with a switch that is not configured correctly so it does not work, a rat’s nest of a server closet, waiting on a over priced cable to configure a switch so someone can use a printer. O by the way, know how I said we had four switches assigned to the office. We have no clue where the forth one is physically located.

TLDR: Issue with printer is a non-configured switch from across the country, waiting 2 weeks on overpriced cable to configure

C - It's not stuck! It's a brand new computer! -*hits the key anwyay-* Ok, I was able to get my password in, let me see if I can pull up something to type.

C - No it's still not working, 8s are appearing again! I didn't even touch the 8!  
M - Sadly, sir, I can't quite think of anything software related that would really cause a situation like this with errant input. Most times it tends to be an issue with the keyboard if that be the case.  
C - So what, you're saying it's junk? I should just throw it out??   
M - No. . . not entirely, I'm saying you may just need to have it repaired if it's after the return date for the purchase. They may have to clean it or replace the keyboard.   
C - Ugh! So I should just throw it out, right in the trash. I just cleaned it!   
M - How did you clean it?  
C - With all the Corona stuff going around I wanted to make sure it was clean so I sprayed disinfectant on it and wiped it down.  
M - You.... sprayed... disinfectant on your laptop?  
C - Yeah, you know, to make sure it's clean!  
M - Sir, you should never spray any sort of liquids on your computer, this is likely where your issue is stemming from. It's entirely possible whatever you sprayed has gotten under the keyboard and shorted/ruined the keyboard because electrical components don't necessarily play well with liquids. I have to recommend you take that in for local hardware restoration.  
C - Oh so I'll just toss it in the trash, great, brand new computer just ruined. **\*click\***

He came back later with the same issue with a co-worker, except this time it was the F1 key stuck so help menu windows were popping up over and over.

When I got him again a month or two after that, I'd forgotten who he was, but sounded familiar: He'd gotten himself an external keyboard for his laptop. Things have been working fine for him, but now the N key is ""stuck"".

"Ohh, that password... (more anonimized)","I used to work at a public facing tech desk in an office supply store, we'll call it oss.

Oss was offering a free ""computer evaluations"" to all customers and that drove alot of our business. One typical day, a very kind older woman(GM) comes up to me with a laptop. She tells me that she wants to get her teen granddaughter's(GD) laptop evaluated and to see what we recommended as far as upgrades to make it faster, as a birthday present. Apparently she was hoping to do this as a surprise.

During the check-in process I ask for the password and gm doesn't have it. I feel a little bad about gm having to call gd and spoil the surprise, but we couldn't do anything to the laptop without the password(because for some reason oss didn't like us techs ""getting around"" pesky things like passwords).

Gm steps away to make the call to gd, as I talk with one of my co-workers and then we hear GM yell ""WHAT?!?"". My co-workers and I look up and gm's face had gone red with a rage that I didn't realize this sweet little old lady was capable of. Then we hear ""SAY THAT AGAIN!!"" A minute later gm hangs up the phone and walks over to the counter where I was still obviously upset. I, trying to remain professional, ask if she was able to get the password and gm hesitates, inhales a deep breath, looks at me and loudly proclaims ""Whore34""...

I have never felt more awkward asking for the specifics of a password, but I had to know... ""Are there any capital letters?"" ""Are there any spaces?"" ""Is 34 spelled out or just a 3 and a 4?"" My fellow techs had all left to the back room. The poor girl at the front register was having trouble keeping a straight face and I was now all alone at tech desk facing down this poor grandmother who had just learned a little more than she wanted to know about her granddaughter. Trying very hard to keep my composure... and my job, I finish the check in and tell her we will let her know as soon as it's done and ask her if she still wants recommendations on upgrades. She leaves and you could tell she was on a mission.

I go in the back and join the rest of the techs laughing our asses off and sharing a ""Did that just happen"" moment.

I worked there for over 5 years so I have many more stories, but this was by far the most hilariously awkward moment during my time there.

Login fails if the user has a broken arm,"I guess I'm not the only software engineer who has to provide free tech support to family and friends 🙂 

One day my mother, a teacher, wants to access her school’s portal, powered by the local Ministry of Education \[ME\]. Imagine her as someone who has used a PC for most of her life, but who rarely has to do anything other than writing on Word or opening Chrome to read emails.  I'm struggling to define her level too, because on the one hand she knows the Equation Editor perfectly, but on the other hand she panics if asked to open a new tab in the browser. In short, since I live and work in a different city, I installed a remote control tool on her Windows so I can help her in cases like this - because explaining the steps on a phone call and sending screenshots scribbled with ""press that key over there"" is not as efficient as it would seem. 

So, my mother tries to enter the Ministry website, which requires a third-party digital ID verification service to log in (think about when you sign in via your Google or GitHub account - same idea, but we call it ‘SPID’), but after a whole morning of failed attempts she gives up and calls me. 

The bottom line is she can't log in, and I find out that she tried all day long and even contacted both the ME and SPID help desks, which among other things suggested her to change passwords and clear the cache, but without success: this login doesn't work, and from my mother's attempts to explain it I can't even understand if the error is on the SPID or ME side, or in the browser or between keyboard and chair. 

I try with her password, making sure she resets it afterwards, and access the account: ""Log in with SPID"", choose SPID service, enter credentials and 2FA code, ""welcome to the Teacher's portal"" - everything is fine, smooth as silk. I describe the steps to my mum and discover that she hasn't even got to the actual login page, but apparently the SPID choice menu doesn't really work for her. So I connect remotely and repeat the steps: everything still works, so it's not a problem with her Chrome or whatever. She tries: nothing, she clicks on the menu and it disappears irreparably, making the login pretty much unusable. 

Maybe for the first time in my life I'm at a loss. What I see doesn't make sense: literally a task that I have no problem with, even remotely and using a crappy connection, it doesn't work for her. I give up too and tell her to try with her sister's Mac, but obviously I can't get the problem out of my head. 

I decide to try again from an old laptop and, surprise, everything works, but thanks to the shabby trackpad at least I manage to reproduce the bug: apparently, if you press any button of the dropdown menu for a fraction of a second too long, the menu closes and won’t let you choose any option. You have to do it on purpose, unless you have a pad that gets stuck, but there it is. 

I report to my mum, who replies ""Now I'll try it with my left hand"". 

The left hand? 🤔 

Suddenly I remember that just a few weeks ago my mother broke her right wrist falling down in the garden, and right now the wrist is bandaged with brace that allows her to use a mouse, but not with great mobility. 

And here's the mystery of the Ministry: the menu buttons don't work unless you click and release them immediately, and it took my mom with a broken wrist to find out what the problem was 😂 

TL;DR: I discovered a bug in a website thanks to my mom's broken arm.",1631,0,1

Let's Test This Feature - With Live Data - In Production - Using PII,"On the side of my FT I do some contract work. This is a company I have worked with for a while now and knew they had some pretty bad practices, but this one takes the cake.

&amp;#x200B;

In essence, there is a form managed by $MarketingSystem that is used by the marketing team to capture leads and is handed off to $TelephonySystem for Sales. Standard stuff.

I built the form, the api, and really the marketing system as a whole. At some point in the month or two gap I had with this client that form broke. Happens. So they want to run some tests and make sure everything is working. Love it!

Here's where we hit the problem

&gt;$Manager : We should do an end-to-end test to make sure everything from the emails to the form to the phone calls are working as expected.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me : I agree. I will load some dummy data and work with $TelephonyOwner to get it done.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Manager : Well, if I remember when we used dummy data before it wasn't 100% accurate so let's just use real data (refers to PII field) and just try that. Ask $TelephonyOwner for some -PII Field- we can use  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me : (Doesn't respond because that just sounds like a horrible idea and I want to forget it ASAP.)

Now, not the first bad idea to be pitched at that company and $Manager is not a developer so I don't expect the best practices to come from there. I assume my luck with $TelephonyOwner who has a tech background to go far better. But...

&gt;$Me : We need to run some tests. I know that my dummy data caused issues before. I was thinking we can source the PII fields from $ProductionSystem test records so we don't have to use real data.  
&gt;  
&gt;$TelephonyOwner : Well, the test needs to be as close to ""Production"" as possible. Ask $Manager for some -PII Field- we can use.

Alright, two dead ends and they both want me to to talk to the other one. This is great. Time to start making sure this is getting written down. I'm still optimistic, maybe someone will get this is a bad idea? So, I write an email

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Includes: $Manager, $TelephonyOwner, $SomeDataTeam  
&gt;  
&gt;$TelephonyOwner : I think we should use data from the source file that runs this thing in Production.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me : We can do an end-to-end test of generating the file to the email all the way through. But I don't want to use live PII data for this because of data security and making sure they are not in any way impacted by testing - including reports. Please get me a set of test PII data that is sufficient for our systems and we can get this done.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Manager : This has to be as close to production as possible. I'm thinking we just **change the Contact Info to our contact info** and run it through that way they aren't contacted. Can we verify that if we do this there's no impact to the customer?

&amp;#x200B;

Fucking kill me. This is a client I won't renew my contract with moving forward. In all honesty, the risk is fairly low in my system that something worthy of a scare happens. It's not connected to their data warehouse as a source of truth for client data so nothing major will be overwritten. But I am not about to use PII data with purposefully wrong data to test a feature when it's absolutely not necessary. God forbid $TelephonySystem does something wrong here or there be an un-documented dependency that actually does overwrite something somewhere.

Fucking especially not going to change it so someone can say I changed client data to address me as the contact for their fucking shit.

No. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I am also pretty sure that deliberately changing contact information associated with PII is illegal. If anyone can find the law the helps define falsifying data related to PII that'd be a huge help.",230,0,1
"""We can't access network drives without being connected to the VPN. Please fix this.""","I love IT.

So we got a ticket this morning about this company's bookkeeper not being able to access the shared drives on the network without connecting to the VPN. Having set up quite a few of these people from this company for working from home, I assumed the bookkeeper was off-site and trying to connect in. 

The email chain--

Me: Is the bookkeeper working from home or is she onsite? If she's working from home, she will need to be connected to the VPN any time she needs to access any network resources at the office. Unfortunately there is no way around that. Is she having trouble with the VPN?

Contact at Company: She's not working from home. She's in the office and working on the desktop PC in her office and still needs to connect to the VPN in order to access the shared drives.

Me: Does her desktop have a network cable plugged in or is she accessing the network wirelessly? It's possible she may be connecting to the wrong network.

Contact: She's not connected with a network cable. We have to use the wifi hotspot on her phone to connect her to the internet so she can VPN in to the office network to access the shared drives. I have a network cable we can try if you think that'll help?

Me: Yes, please plug in her computer with the network cable to the wall jack that should be located on the wall next to her desk. Let me know if that fixes it.

Contact: It worked! All we did was plug it in and it reconnected to the office network. Whatever you did remotely before we plugged it in worked!

Me: Glad to help. If I may ask, was her computer connected to the office network with a network cable before? Did it get unplugged somehow, or was it removed for some reason?

Contact: It was connected before she left, we took the network cable out of her office when she came back because she'd been working off a wireless network at home and we didn't want to confuse the server.

Me: Well I'm glad it's working now, have a great day!",3424,0,1
That time it was 2015 in 2020,"So this is going back to January of this year when I started at my current job.

Backstory:
Mid-sized digital center - every room has a multimedia PC linked to a screen, you can wirelessly cast to them and they are controlled by an android panel embedded in the walls, the android panel communicates with a 'brain' that can then send commands via serial to whatever devices it needs to control. It sends these commands over the LAN.

So we have these tech contractors out trying to solve an issue.
Apparently, this had been going on for months. One of our controllers would lose connection to the 'brain' it's assigned to, resulting in a loss of control of the room.

For months the Brain had been RMA'd and tested over and over again, at the supplier's workbench it worked fine, on-site it would stop working after a period of time.

I decided that I would spend my time trying to help them out, and I noticed that in the logs the brain was spewing out, they were timestamped with dd.mm.2015@hh.mm.ss.

I pointed this out to the tech, who said it shouldn't matter - but the connection the controller and brain require an SSL certificate to link - which is only valid for a certain timeframe - the brain thinks it's 2015, the controller is set to 2020.

It turns out that ANOTHER supplier, our networking installer had blocked access to  pool.ntp (a timeserver) that all of our devices used - apparently this brain just has really bad time precision/a bad crystal, or can't save time (hence 2015).

Still wrapping my head around why you'd block access to a timeserver...

It's been resolved now - but it such a bizarre issue - I'm still convinced our network is haunted.",760,0,1
Don't outsource your support business to your ISP...,"Years ago I worked for a major ISP in my country who found that they could monetise the customers who thought that ""Anything remotely computer-y == ISP"". So instead of turning them away because the ISP didn't provide the printer/CCTV/iPhone/Xbox etc they were sold a support contract and passed to us. Our remit was ""fix the problem"" they didn't care how.

An important point to note is that our ""Total Support"" contract covered up to 3 computers and any number of peripherals/consoles/phones etc, but while our ticketing system would log a unique ID for each system it wouldn't flag that we had worked on more than 3 for the same customer.

To set the scene, we are currently getting a very high number of calls about computers getting ransomware (nothing like the modern stuff, this was just a full page that would flash a Police badge and demand money through Liberty Reserve or the heavies would pay you a visit).

Dramatis Personae

* $Me: Our Hero
* $Buddy: A senior tech friend of mine who was walking the floor the day this happened
* $Chancer: Our plucky luck-chancing customer

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;$Phone: \*Rings Obnoxiously\*  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: Hello and welcome to the Helldesk^(tm) How can I help?  
&gt;  
&gt;$Chancer: Yea I've got that police virus thing on my computer.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: I'm sorry to hear that and I should be able to help you out, let's get you into Safe Mode and onto our remote access tools...

&amp;#x200B;

I guide the customer through getting into Safe Mode with Networking, download our Remote Support tools and get onto the machine.

At this point I kick off our tools and tell the customer they can leave the machine with me and that they can speak to me on live chat rather than on the phone.

I take a quick look at the customer account and notice a large number of tickets, many of which have been closed and re-opened multiple times by various agents. We provide a 30 day warranty on work done so this does happen if the same issue recurs but not to this extent. I dig deeper and list out the ID's of the machines we have worked on.

The list is long. Much, much longer than the 3 PC's the customer is supposed to be limited to. There are around 50-60 entries. This is not normal, so I call over my $Buddy and point it out to him. $Buddy tells me to keep on with the work and he will look into it.

Not 10 minutes later I'm called over to the manager's desk where $Buddy has a Facebook page up. The name on the page is $Chancer, and he is advertising ""Malware Removal Services"" for much more than we are charging him. The sneaky bugger was taking an infected PC home, connecting it to his network then getting us to do the work of cleaning it up!

I was ordered to finish the work, then cancel his support contract with us. Oh joy.

Once I was done I pinged $Chancer on live chat.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;$Me: Hi there, Ive finished up here but I noticed some irregularities with your account. It seems you have had us do a large amount of work for you on computers you do not own while taking payment for that work. Unfortunately I have been informed that this is quite a serious breach of our Terms of Service and I will need to cancel your Support Contract with us.  
&gt;  
&gt;$Chancer: What? How dare you accuse me of wrongdoing! I demand to speak with a manager immediately!  
&gt;  
&gt;$Me: I'm sorry but this has come from management, if you want to make a complaint you can contact our complaints department on (number) or if you wish to speak with someone here you can call our team on (our number). I have to disconnect this session.

&amp;#x200B;

I expected our frontline agents to get some angry customer noises but the notes on the account would curtail any issues with managers. What I did not expect was for $Chancer to spam our remote support service with connections. For context our remote support service authenticates a customer by having them log into a support app with their ISP credentials, if they are an existing customer they are routed directly to the techs. Our side of the app was limited to 10 customer sessions at a time which was soon filled with sessions from $Chancer who had some very colourful things to say to us.

The deluge lasted for about an hour and caused some pain and delays to genuine customers, in addition to crashing some of our older workstations. It only ended when our management got hold of a VP who could authorise the immediate termination of $Chancer's service with ISP; Phone, Broadband and TV.

So, if you're going to outsource your tech support to your ISP; be subtle about it. And take it on the chin when you inevitably get rumbled!",2162,0,1

**DC**: HI,

I have 2 servers on 2 different systems which just drop off the network for no good reason. A reboot solved the issue on every occasion but it's becoming annoying.

1 of these it happens so often, we have moved the iot devices to a new server but have to leave the original server there for the licenses.

The Latest version of the server and client applications, other servers on other systems are ok.

Any ideas what I can do?

**Me**: Hi DC,

How do you connect to the servers? Via the LAN or WAN? Via the desktop application or the mobile application?

As a local user or a remote user?

When dropped off from the network, what does it mean?

Unable to be reached? Does it continue to communicate with the IOT device or are they unavailable as well? Can you ping the server?

Did you check the logs?

What do you consider to be the latest version? v1 build 123 or v1 build 321 or another version?

Lots of questions, I know. Please take notice of our fixed topic where you can find where we list the information we need to provide you with the best possible support.

If you keep this in mind and provide such information, it will be easier for us to suggest a solution.

**DC:** Some of these questions are either irrelevant or obvious, which is why I left them out.

* Devices are connected over LAN
* Both local and remote.
* The server DROPS OFF the network, meaning the licenses are gone, the connection is gone it's all gone until there is a reboot. Lights are on but you cannot ping it, you cannot see it via clients and devices fail over to other servers
* no it doesn't continue to communicate, its gone, it has ceased to be, its metabolic processes re now history, it is bereft of life
* Nothing in logs
* 321.as I said the latest

This has been happening to the servers since they were released, It used to be someone would log in and do their thing and it would be fixed. I would just like to know how to resolve it myself. I don't have time to write war and peace on it, providing info that has no bearing on the solution or the problem. 

**DC**: THE VERSION IS 123, AS I SAID THE LATEST AVAILABLE

**Me**: Okay login to the device through SSH and execute command X, Y and Z. After these commands, please upgrade to version 321, the latest available version.

One Of The Good Ones,"Hello everyone,

I wanted to share a positive story, one that happened to me yesterday. 

I had a user call in because her direct access wasn't working, I'm unsure if other companies use this but to cover my bases it's a VPN that is basically always on from initial login. 

Well it's not that it wasn't working, but it just wasn't on her computer at all.

But anyways, she called in because she couldn't access network drives at home. She told me that she called in a few days prior and she was told after troubleshooting done then that she would need to go into an office for further troubleshooting. Usually when people call in under these circumstances they're usually frustrated and more than willing to share that frustration, not this lady though.

The call ended up lasting about an hour, during this time I went through all the troubleshooting at my disposal (making sure her computer was in the proper group in AD, making sure her group policies were up to date, running software cycles) and basically all the other troubleshooting we had listed for this type of issue. The whole time, she was incredibly patient and understanding, and she kept actively trying to initiate small talk (a rarity from the users we support). 

After getting a fresh perspective on the issue, we were able to get her taken care of and she was so appreciative for the help. That call, while close to the end of my shift, made whole day.

He assumed this was because he unplugged it while it was booting and his OS files got corrupted (partially true, but we'll get to that). He wanted us to reinstall windows (I think...tbh I'm not entirely sure what he expected us to do). We booked it in for diagnostics because we don't do anything unless we're sure what the issue is. 

We run some tests and lo and behold, his hard drive is failing. Just to be sure it's not a fluke we always run a second test. Failed again. So I call him to explain this to him and offer to replace it with an SSD, upgrade him to windows 10, and transfer his files (or he could buy a new computer because as stated in the title, this one is over 10 years old). He immediately gets pissed at me because he ""knows for a fact"" that his drive is ""perfectly healthy"" and that just his OS files are corrupted. He then proceeds to regurgitate to me what he probably read in the first article to pop up after googling his error code. I then explain to him that it's common for failing hard drives to be the reason for corrupt files but he's convinced I'm lying to him to take his money. 

After a bit of back and forth with him he decides he's going to come and pick up his PC. He shows up and we get into another argument because he wants a refund because we gave him a ""bogus diagnosis"" and ""didn't do our job properly"". He's convinced that there's no possible way his 10+ year old hard drive (that was over 90% full) is failing and he refuses to give us anymore money. Eventually my manager gets involved and gives him his refund just to get rid of him. 

He leaves and comes back later to buy the SSD I attempted to sell him earlier. I assume he's going to attempt to replace it himself. Something tells me he'll be back.

Moral of the story: I hate people. 

Tl;dr: guy brings in his computer thinking his OS files are corrupt and wants it fixed. We find out his HDD is dying but he doesn't believe us and argues his way to a refund, only to end up buying a new SSD anyway.

"""It's not HIS computer, it's OUR computer!""","Long time lurker, first time poster. We'll see how it goes... :)

This happened back in 2006, when software was still delivered on CD-ROM and installed on Windows XP home computers. I worked as the only support rep for a small company making learning software for kids. I got a call from a nice, slightly older lady who had difficulties installing our software. The conversation was quite pleasant... until we figured out what the actual problem was...

*Me:* Okay, so the error you're getting says that you need to be logged on as an administrator to install some additional packages that our software relies on. Normally, you should be able to install them automatically. But are you trying to install this in the Windows profile of your child?

*Lady:* No, this is my own profile.

*Me:* Ah. Are you normally able to install software?

*Lady:* I dunno... my husband usually does this stuff, but he's at work now.

*Me:* Well, perhaps we could try installing a different package. *\*proceeds to help her download Teamviewer just as a test. Same error occurs.\**

*Me:* So, it looks like your profile may have insufficient rights to install these components. Are you able to log on to the other profile on this computer?

*Lady:* No, that's my husband's and I dunno the password for that. Look, what do you mean by *""insufficient rights""*?

*Me:* Er... the most likely cause of these is that your computer is set up so that only the administrator's profile can install programs.

*Lady:* What?! Why is it set up in that way?? It's my own computer!!! I should be able to install whatever I want on it!!!

*Me:* Okay, so maybe you could ask your husband to look into this when he gets home.

*Lady:* Oh, I definitely will! This is ridiculous! It's not **HIS** computer... it's **OUR** computer!!!

*Me:* Umm, yes, so I'm sure he can change those settings so you can install the software for your child. Do you require any further assistance at this time?

*Lady:* No, thanks, you've been very helpful. And I'll definitely take this up with my husband as soon as he gets home! ""Insufficient rights, *sure*!"" 

*Me:* Alright, um... have a great rest of your day then.

I felt slightly bad for that poor unsuspicious husband, who had to come home to an enraged wife ready to have a strong talk about restricting her access to their computer. I hope things worked out for them :).",2657,0,1
I need a loan unit NOW!,"Friday afternoon had a ticket from a customer having issues with his laptop. It won't turn on and he says it is dead.

I tried getting more info. The guy sounded agitated over the emails and kept saying the Laptop died and he has a lot of work he needs to finish over the weekend and needs a loan laptop straight away. I could not get any information from him regarding how the laptop died.

I get a call from a manager who says client company's boss called and asks me to just drive there and give him a loan machine then swap the HDD. The loan will be the same model so he should be able to continue working without any issues. (guy had complained to his boss who called my manager why we wouldn't give him the loan since they are paying for the service as part of their contract).

Already 3:30 on a Friday. They are an hour away, I should still be able to finish at 5 so I left straight away.

When I got there he shows me the laptop that wont power on. Starts on a rant about how one of our techs were resolving an issue by remoting into his system a few days ago which killed the laptop. I press the power button and nothing. I try checking the charging cable and the DC plug is very loose. The connector is entirely wrong, the brick is not even for a laptop charger (24v). 

&gt;Me: Where did you get this? Where is the original.

&gt;Him: The original sparked and burned. I found this somewhere in the office. 

&gt;Me: Why... Didn't you say so when I was asking about the issue over the emails.

&gt;Him: We thought it was the laptop.

I plugged the proper charger. Laptop started charging, testing everything to be working.

His boss comes over to have a look since he wants to know why we are being stingy with providing them with the loans, a service they pay for. I explained how the charging brick died and how his employee plugged in the first power brick he could find where the DC connector didn't even fit properly. The boss's mood changes and starts grilling his employee who answers sheepishly while trying to not make eye contact with anyone.

Before leaving I continued stressing why this is the reason we ask questions regarding issues.",534,0,1
My computer won't boot up after installing a hard drive!,"Ok, this one is way back in 2002 (I think).

I was working for a now defunct computer manufacturer in their tech support call center.   
I got a call from someone that was reporting problems adding a hard drive to their computer.

For reference, this is back before SATA hard drives.

This person was trying to use 4 hard drives in their computer. Not usually a problem, as the computer had two IDE channels to hook drives to.  
As I dug into troubleshooting with this person, checking jumpers, cables are secured, etc, I thought their IDE cable was bad, when they said that couldn't be the problem as they had it made for them.

My mind was like...wait, what?

I asked them to clarify what they meant by that. They confessed they had an IDE cable made to support FOUR drives on one chain. For those that aren't familiar, IDE connections can only support two drives per chain, a primary and a secondary drive!

Turns out this person had blown the IDE controller on their motherboard at least 2-3 times before.

Told them I'm replacing it this last time, instructed them to never use that cable again, and that I was putting notes on their account that if they use this cable again and it fries another IDE controller that we were voiding the warranty. (Honestly, it should've already been voided, but I was just starting out and feeling generous. If this happened now, I wouldn't hesitate to void their warranty now).

Told my co-workers and we all shook our heads.",691,0,1
I can't read work emails from home.,"Hey, whilst not strictly being tech support, I work on the tech department of my company.  

We recently migrated from using G-suite to Office 365, so everyone got new emails and cloud storage so we had to deal with all that. It went easier than I thought it would, the only ""problem"" was discovered about a week later. I overheard this conversation happening between two people from customer support.

**Me**: me  
**CSA**: Customer service agent  
**CSB**: Customer service boss

&gt;**CSB**: Hey, I need some help. My colleague has an email I need, but he is out sick today so we can't get to it.

&gt;**CSA**: Oh damn, well I'll just ask him for the password so we can login.  

*This is where I jump in*

&gt;**Me**: Hey, I don't really like sharing of accounts, can't he just forward it to yuo from home? If he isn't too sick I mean, it would only take like a second.

&gt;**CSB**: Well he can't get into his work email because he isn't at work! You should know that.

*We had no restrictions on the email accounts, you did not need a vpn or anything whilst at home, so this took me by surprise.*

&gt;**Me**: Why not? 

&gt;**CSA**: Well, since we changed from our old emails we can no longer login from home, isn't that how it is supposed to be?

&gt;**Me**: No there is nothing stopping you. I understand that you maybe don't have Outlook installed at home but you can always log in through a web browser.

&gt;**CSB**: No, it just says ""Couldn't find your account"", it's been like this ever since the switch.

*I say the magic words*

&gt;**Me**: Show me.

*CSB opens up a laptop, opens chrome and goes to login. My heart sinks.*

&gt;**Me**: Hey CSB, it's fine I already figured out the problem.

&gt;**CSB**: How I haven't even tried yet? Didn't you need to see the error message or whatever.

&gt;**Me**: Remember how we changed from Google Drive to Sharepoint and Onedrive?

&gt;**CSB/A**: Yeah.

&gt;**Me**: And how you downloaded Excel and word from office.com?

&gt;**CSB**: Yeah we all did that, what is the point?

&gt;**Me**: The point is if you go on office.com and press the outlook symbol, you get into your email. You can also go directly to outlook.office.com and login there. That is how we login to our emails without installing outlook.

They had tried to login via gmail.com, like we used to before the change.  
CSB had told everyone that it wasn't possible to login from home anymore since she couldn't make it work, so they all just accepted this and tried to work around it.

I showed them the correct way and made sure that they told everyone else that might get the same idea, and then wished that drinking at the office wasn't so frowned upon",1892,0,1
My host rebooted!,"Hey guys, I'm back again with another fun tale from today!


I got a call today where the triage agent who sent it to me was told it was identical to a previous case that we (my company) had worked with another agent, and the customer wanted to clone the case and just keep trucking.


I looked over the old case, and found that their Nutanix node had rebooted unexpectedly, and they wanted to know why. No one could find a reason, but we found that their firmware was sorely out of date, and requested that they update using the LCM/Prism. They said they couldn't do the updates yet, and they would do the updates at the end of the month. Cool. We got their buy in to close the case at this time, and they could reach out when they were ready.


Cue today. They call in, the triage agent is confused because there's a language barrier on the customer's end, they keep saying they want to clone a case, the agent doesn't have a button to do so, so they send it to me. I realize what's going on and take the case.


So I ask the customer when the last time the machine rebooted unexpectedly is, and they go, ""June 24th.""


....Okay....if this case matches the last case, why are we dealing with a reboot from 6/24? 


And they then proceed to show me that their ESXi host has dropped out of vCenter and they want to know why and how...okay, so it's not at all related to the last case.


So I try to reconnect the host to vCenter, and it fails, telling me, of course, that the host may have droppped out of vCenter, there may be networking issues, or management services may have frozen.


So I explain this to them, spin up a LOM connection so it's like I'm sitting in front of the box, and find where it very clearly states that hostd is locked up. Tap F2 to try and drop to console and restart vpaxd and hostd, no dice, no response. 


So I explain to them that they need to reboot that host, that's the only way to get the management services to let go. They can't do that, because it's a bad time and their VMs are still up. 


Cool, you need to reboot that host as soon as possible. ""Okay, but can you confirm there are no hardware issues?""


""Of course, I've already checked the hardware logs you provided, and there are no issues.""


I let them go with the understanding that they'll reboot the host and follow up with me on Monday, or call in if they need anything.


I hang up, take my next call. 10 minutes later, I get an email from them going, ""We have VMware on a Zoom bridge, can you join?""


""Well, no, I'm on an active call.""


They then email my management, as well as half of their own team for some reason, asking for someone to join a Zoom bridge with VMware. My management gets someone on the bridge, and aparently, they had rebooted already and were able to get a VMware Support Bundle, that they then want analyzed to see why their management services are locking up.


It...it couldn't possibly be due to the out of date firmware you have running on your system, could it, Mr. Customer? Could that possibly be the cause of your issue that we tried to have you address two weeks ago, and you pushed us out for a month?


More to come if you guys are interested in updates.",246,0,1
"The ""mystery"" of the third display","Here's a fun one, not necessarily too facepalmy given the circumstances, but I thought it was a fun easy one nonetheless.

One of our nice, elderly users called in to our Tier 1 saying that her system was showing a third display but she's only using 2 monitors. After exhausting all possible settings they could think of, T1 passed it off to us.

Once the ticket gets to us, it's typically hardware related and we'll need to put hands on it. As the majority of our user base is working from home during these times, I emailed the user to let her know she'd have to come in and have us look at her system. I also told her to bring everything with her as it sits on her desk so I could get a more accurate idea of exactly what's going on. 

She arrives a little while later and we start lugging everything inside from her car...and that's when I see what the issue is. The one external monitor had 2 display cables running from it to the docking station (she was using the laptop's screen as the 2nd monitor). Sure enough, we fired everything up, I checked the Windows settings, and there it showed 3 displays. I unplugged the VGA cable from the docking station, the screens flickered, and then only 2 displays were present in Windows. Voila.

I advised the user as to what I did and she was happy with the outcome. It wasn't exactly something that Tier 1 could've seen over the phone or even a remote session so I can't really blame them. It's just assumed that they would only have one display cable per monitor plugged in.",273,0,1

"Scheduled upgrade, gonna call and say tech didn't show","So I currently work for a company that supports a wide variety of hardware and software products for clients. I had a scheduled upgrade to one of these units (software upgrade) to begin at 5am, so I'm on site at 4:50am.

I waited outside their front door for 40 minutes before getting annoyed and contacting their helpdesk to get them to contact this particular client. The helpdesk replied with, ""Funny, as the person on site just contacted us to see if you were even coming as she said you weren't there yet"".

I swear... What rational thought goes through these people's head? If you aren't even going to check the front door looking for the technician, why would you bother reporting a no show when you are absolutely going to get called out on your bullshit...

This person is lucky I contacted the helpdesk, as these get called off if the change isn't started within x time, and you can be sure this client would have been charged the cost for travel/labour had we had to come back.

Why I shouldn't tell people where I work,"Not exactly a story from work but it was a very weird/random situation to provide tech support. Situations like this is why it's best sometimes to not tell people you work in IT, a principal I will now be adopting permanently.

I got a haircut today, for the first time in a while due to lockdown. Like the stereotypical IT guy I'm a bit of a socially awkward person and I'm especially not the type to chat to my barber, however it was one of the few times I've left the house since lockdown started to lift and that I'd been around random people so I guess I was missing human interaction a bit.

I'm half way through my haircut and barber asks me where I work, I mention that I work in technical support. Barber suddenly stops cutting my hair and says ""oh really? One sec"" he walks off, I'm sat there confused not really knowing what to do. Is he coming back? My haircut needs finishing!

3 minutes later barber re-emerges with his iphone and a car forum pulled up in the web browser. He asks me ""how do I install this app to my phone?"". The forum was about a bit of software for Windows that was something to do with tuning a BMW or something, clearly it was a sort of how-to guide on how to get a cracked version of the software for free. I didn't really know what to say, I just wanted my haircut finished.

From the glimpse I got of the forum it seems it wasn't as simple as clicking a .exe to install it. I'm sure if I looked over it for 10 minutes I could have given him some pointers on how to install it, but the last thing I wanted was to accidentally assist my barber in installing Ransomware or something, and then for him to 'slip' during my next haircut out of spite. To be honest the last thing I wanted to do was anything IT related at all, I just wanted a haircut.

I told him I wouldn't recommend downloading illegal copies of software off the internet as it could be a scam or virus, and that it wasn't compatible with his iPhone anyway. He seemed underwhelmed by my comment, but luckily that was the end of the it.

Moral of the story: if random people, acquaintances, or even some friends ask where you work, tell them you work in sales or something, because otherwise you instantly become free tech support.",352,0,1

We don't recommend migrating from Dev to Prod,"Working for a MSP for financial institutions, I have many stories. One of our responsibilities is web hosting. To be explicitly clear, I am not a developer. We provide the environment and lock it down with specific permissions. As a result, I work with the client and their developers to get them set up and the developers and clients take care of the rest. When its time to go live, we can swap databases, update DNS if applicable, etc. etc. As far a content, we don't touch it.

TL;DR - New website was constructed in a dev environment. Upon moving to production, client had customers come in with print outs of low interest rates and questioned why I moved a development database to production. The developers said that was a bad practice.

Now to the story!

Client was looking to update their website and requested a development environment be set up. No worries! I spun it up, provided the creds to the client, who passed them to their dev. Fast forward a bit, things were going smoothly. The dev would have a permissions issue, I'd assist. The client and dev added content and its always cool (to me, at least) to be able to see the new website come together. So far, no issues.

Time to go live! We scheduled the go live and I made it explicitly clear that all I would be doing is migrating the current database in the development environment over to the production environment. In this case, that is all that actually needed to be done.

It went smoothly, and just like that their new site was live! Of course, I had the client and dev confirm that everything on the site looked good. (click all the links, check the pages, just make sure it works and looks good,ya know?)

""Looks great! All is well!' said the client. ""Fantastic! Thanks for working with me throughout this process!"", I said.

Fast forward a week. I get an email from a manager questioning what I did because the client (a bank) now had customers coming in with a print out of (apparently) a very old, low interest rate. I explained what I did (again, just swapped the database from development to production and had the client verify all looked good).

The manager continued talking with the client, who then claimed they were unaware they needed to completely review the site's content before going live. They questioned why I migrated the database from the development environment to production and asked if that is the standard process. I assured them that it was. They came back by saying ""We talked to our developers and they were unaware that you would be migrating the content from the development environment to production. They stated that is bad practice as the content may be outdated"".

""Um. Wait, what? But you asked for the dev environment to begin with... and you said you checked the site after going live .... and weeks working in the dev environment....where did you think the content was coming from.... ????"" -My thoughts

After I was finished dying from laughter, I respectfully apologized to the client for the miscommunication. I didn't get in trouble or anything; I didn't do anything wrong.

I love memes as much as the next person and I'm just left thinking of that Jackie Chan meme. It seems to be the best way to describe how I was feeling.

Next time, the client is going to have to take a page from Bill O'Reilly and say ""F\*\*\* it, we'll do it live!"", I guess.",214,0,1

I Can't Login To The Computer,"Hello all,

I have another story that just happened yesterday and I might have found the most computer illiterate person that works for the company I support.

The cast:

* Me: The narrator of this story once again
* CIE: or computer illiterate person

The user calls into the helpdesk for assistance logging into a computer. 

To give a little background on this matter we have certain computers that users normally log into a local account on the computer. The user name and password for this account are two very easy words, but users need to put .\\ before it this is the tricky part for most. This is the reason CIE calls in.

&gt;Me: Thank you for contacting the \[company redacted\] help desk my name is EonThief how can I help you today?  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: \*in a loud shrill voice\* Hello, I need help logging into the computer to log meds.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay, I can help with that are you logging into the local account?  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: The what?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: The "".\\user"" account.  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: Yes I'm logging into the ""slash user"" account

Remember that ""slash""

&gt;Me: Okay well what are you typing?  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: I'm putting the dot then hitting the C A P S (she actually spelled out the word) button then the slash.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I'm sorry what button?  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: The C A P S button the one on the left side.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: No ma'am that's the wrong button, you need to hit shift then the ""\\"" button.  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: Shift? The helpdesk told me it's the CAPS button.

I checked with everyone on my team and no one spoke to her, no tickets made nothing. But I don't say anything to the user for fear of anger that I called her a liar.

&gt;Me: Well ma'am who ever told you that is wrong. You need to hit shift.  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: Okay

I hear typing, then the user comes back to me .

&gt;CIE: Okay I tried it, I hit dot then shift ""slash"" and user.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay which slash did you hit, the one that starts top right then the line goes down to the left? or the one that starts top left and goes down to the right?  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: I hit the ""slash"" with the line on it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay ma'am, that didn't answer my question.

I proceeded got the same answer, I tried FIVE more times with different variations wondering if I wasn't being clear enough. Then I gave up.

&gt;Me: Okay ma'am you haven't answered any of the questions I asked, describe to me the line you typed in, what does it look like?

I figured that this would be easier then trying to ask the same questions fruitlessly.

&gt;CIE: It's a slash.

At this point I told her to hold on for a minute, I muted myself and hit my head on my desk.

&gt;Me: Ma'am, that didn't answer my question. Describe the line to me, does it start on the top left or bottom left? Does it go up or down from it's starting point?  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: Sir, it's a line I don't know how else to describe it.

I'm genuinely stunned, I gave her more then enough descriptors she could use. I was silent for a few moments but had one more thing to try.

&gt;Me: Are you looking at the keyboard?  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: Yes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay, the symbol you're looking for is under the backspace button.  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE:  Okay I'll try that.

A few moments go by and I hear her typing.

&gt;CIE: It didn't like the username.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Which one did you hit?  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: The one with a line on top, a long line then a line on the bottom.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: What?  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: Yeah, that's the line you were talking about right?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: \*I'm defeated at this point\* No, no it wasn't.  
&gt;  
&gt;CIE: Ya know what? I'm just gonna wait for someone with more computer knowledge then me to do this. Have a good day!

To preface, we had a 1 hour training session on how to use $ContentFeature of $MarketingSoftware. In this training session I taught a group of people some best practices for managing their content and some high level process stuff - nothing crazy and it was high level so I expected some questions after the meeting.

Sure enough we got $Client coming in with 4 long winded email questions. She had a few totally valid questions in the meeting but... You ever have that one person who you can just tell the moment they start talking they're not technical? Like, not even that she asked a dumb question, I just had that feeling.

Well this email confirmed it and would have been well worth a meeting but, if I can avoid a meeting to focus on my other meetings I will do that. So, I segmented each question individually and wrote my responses. 

**$Client -** How do I upload images? It says they're all pending. How long until they're approved

**$Me -** (Understands that some software require image approval) No worries, you approve it yourself. Just click publish underneath the image and you'll be good to go! -Insert link with guided image walkthrough of doing exactly this-

**$Client -** I just tried uploading again and it's still pending... How do I get my images in there -insert screenshot with publish button clearly on the screen in the same spot as the walkthrough-

You never know until you try!,"Around ten years ago My grandfather (80 at the time) was given an E-reader. The adjustable text size basically gave him back books as a hobby.

He asked me to teach him how to download books from the library. To me, easy, to him, a learning commitment. 

I gave him a desktop shortcut to simplify things, and then there were maybe six or seven steps to follow. He wrote down each step, as well as what the computer was supposed to do with each step.

The relevant notes to this story were, “plug in USB cable (rectangle) white side down, ‘KOBO’ folder appears.”

After a couple of months successfully consuming the library’s online selections, he calls me for help. It’s not working right. When he plugs it in, the folder doesn’t appear. I go over to check it out, and my grandparents feed me before they let me look, and ask me to guess at what it might be. “Do you think I need a new computer? Will I need a new Kobo?”

Nothing so drastic. I restarted both, and poked at things until it worked. To be honest, I don’t remember how I fixed it.

What I will always remember is his attempted solution.

The Kobo was unplugged, but there was a KOBO folder right where it should be.

He knew there was supposed to be one, and when it didn’t populate, he made a new folder and named it appropriately.

Of course it didn’t work, but the fact that he had the confidence to try to solve it himself, that he came up with that plan, and worked out how to execute it...

That made me really proud.",749,0,1
It’s time sensitive but I don’t want you. You need to escalate the ticket.,"*No lives were at risk for this problem.*

Background: I work for a 3rd party help desk. I got a call from someone telling me they need administrative privileges to download some software, we’re able to do this. Due to not normally getting calls from them or needing to remote in I didn’t have the remote software up and running. To do so I have to use Citrix (ugg) it takes forever for it to load for me. I informed them that it will take some time to load. When if finally loaded (2 minutes max) I asked them to navigate to a site so they can enter a session key. 

Them: I’ve never had to go to a site before they always just can do it. I’ve worked here for 20 years.

Me: Well this is how I’m instructed to do this.

Them: this is time sensitive and I don’t have time for this can I talk to someone who know what they’re doing

Me: (not allowed to actively transfer calls and knowing it’s wound’ve taken me 30 seconds more to download it) Well I can do it, but I can get this escalated for you

Them: Yes this is time sensitive and I need it done 

Me: (knowing it could be a few hours if not the next day they would get back to them) okay I’ll get this ticket escalated for you 

TL;DR I could’ve solved the “time sensitive” problem in another 30 seconds, but since they asked for it to be escalated it will be a few hours if not tomorrow till it’s looked at.",1971,0,1
The Trick,"I am a software developer. While not strictly tech support, you seem to like my stories. This story is about one particularly difficult client. 

A few stapled together papers landed on my desk. I looked up. It was my boss. 

Boss: Good morning, u/geon ! Can you take a look at these requirements and give me an estimate? We might have a new project for you.

Me: Sure thing, boss!

My boss is the best boss ever. It could be that he is just and rational, wanting to keep me employed because I’m good at what I do, but I don’t think so. He is also a great guy. 

The requirements were nothing special. Collect some data. Display some reports. Stuff like that. Simple. The client was happy with my estimate, so we go meet them.

My contact at the client is a tall, large man in his sixties. I am tall myself, but he is towering above me at yet another 4 inches. His handshake is firm, bordering to abusive. When he speaks, the whole room resonates with his bass voice. He has a gravitas that forces you to take him seriously. If this was the stone age, he would be the clan leader, and no one would think of questioning it. A true Alpha male. 

“Hello, u/geon , I’m Alpha.”, he says.

Once the room has stopped resonating, and he has given my hand back, I involuntarily compare myself to him. I am lanky with a creaky voice. I had a baby face until I turned 35, and can barely grow a beard. Good thing I base my sense of self worth on my professional abilities instead.

We land the project, and a couple of weeks later we have another meeting. Having built most of what the initial requirements asked for, I was proud to show the prototype of the interface. The client seemed mostly happy, but had some additional features they wanted to add. This went on for a couple of weeks. Each of them in isolation wasn’t a big deal, but they started to add up. We call this phenomenon “feature creep”. The creep of features eventually slowed down, but not until they included a complete customer relationship management tool.

Alpha was not happy with the rate of progress. Unfortunately I did not have much to demo, since I was working on the underlying structure rather than the user interface. I suggested I would add parts of the UI as mock-ups; non functional interfaces to make it easier to visualize the end product.

This made Alpha happy, but he was still impatient. He suggested that he would make sketches of the screens for me to implement. This was a great idea, because having something visual makes it easier to communicate and reason about the project. It is a tool I have used a lot.

A couple of days later, Alpha comes back. He is exited. He has drawn up sketches in Powerpoint for about 10 screens, and even added links on buttons to flip to the target sketch. This is great!

I immediately notice inconsistencies. That is OK; it is just a sketch. The whole point is to sort that kind of issues out. So I start building the mockup ui based on the sketches, but with my own correction. In some places, the sketched are a bit nonsensical. That is OK too; not everyone is a professional user interface designer. I just adapt the sketches as needed.

I show my progress to Alpha regularly, but he seems less satisfied each day. Eventually he makes it clear that he expects me to follow his sketches exactly. There is no room for my interpretation.

Whoa! The sketches have suddenly become a specification. Inconsistencies and all. What is worse, Alpha has become so emotionally invested in the sketches that I have to argue for each and every change.

I can sense that this is a delicate subject, but I feel it is my duty as a professional to try to reason with Alpha.

Me: Hey, Alpha? The sketches are great starting points for talking, but not great UI. Perhaps let me do the actual designs? I am a professional.

Alpha: Pffft! I have worked on successful software projects for *decades*. I think I know what I’m doing!

I need a way forward, so I Talk with my boss. He is baffled as well, but suggests we try to give Alpha what he asks for, since reasoning with him isn’t working. I put aside the UI I had been working on, and start over fresh.

When I tried to deduce the underlaying data structure from the designs, things like contact info would be wildly inconsistent. Sometimes there would be multiple phone numbers or none. Same with names and email. Physical addresses would have random parts missing. OK. I let Alpha know about each issue, and built them they way he sketched them out. All of his “completed” designs were broken and half baked.

Alpha actually seemed happier after this. But he complained about the size of the screens. He had to scroll to see all of each screen. He does not like scrolling. I prodded him about the actual issue. It turned out he had designed the user interface (in Powerpoint) to fit each screen in it’s entirety on the computer at once. His computer.

After more questioning, I found out that he has a 14 inch laptop. The end users have either 24 inch desktop monitors or smartphones. *Sigh*

Part of the problem is that Alpha has invented his own UI paradigms. “Screens” would have a fixed layout, with no scrolling. Web apps don’t work like that. I believe his decades of experience was from terminal based mainframe systems, like the airports and banks usually have.

Alpha wanted to use input fields to display output data. To make input/output textfields distinct, they would have differently colored borders. I explain that a separate output layout for input/output is much more compact, easier to read and actually had a hope of fitting on his laptop screen. But he was not interested. 

He did not know what a pop-up modal dialog was. You know when you save a file, and a dialog asks for a location and a file name, and you can’t continue working until you click OK or Cancel? He instead insisted on creating new entries by selecting “New” in a select box that would also select an existing entry for editing (or display). This is bad “separation of concerns” and leads to horrible, messy code. It is also tricky when there is no existing entry, and you can’t detect when the “New” option is selected, because it is the only one. All of this made the development take at least 4 times as long as necessary.

Somehow the project chugged along. After completing all mockups, it was time to add the actual functionality. Keep in mind that nothing so far worked. It was all façade, like a western movie set.

I began to explain the methodology we like, that I personally as well as most of the software industry believes in; minimum viable project. In essence, you start with something tiny and expand on it, making sure you always have something working. 

This is important, because the alternative; to plan everything out in detail and start building it all at once very rarely works, is expensive, slow and can’t handle changing requirements. And requirements *always* change. This kind of mismanaged projects can easily kill a company. 

Me: So as you see, we should start small, and expand the project one feature at a time, to ensure we stay on track. 

Alpha: No. Since we have little time, it is important that you complete one powerpoint screen at a time and NOT go back to it. When it is done it is DONE. I absolutely do *not* want to hear that you are rewriting code that has already been completed.

At this point I tried to explain about “technical debt” and how it affects software projects. Basically, when you write code, you make assumptions, and as you make changes to the code, the assumptions are no longer true (if they ever were), so old pieces makes less and less sense. So the pieces don’t really fit together that well anymore. This needs to be fixed, and if you don’t, you accumulate “technical debt”. Once this debt grows too large and you have weird looking code all over the place, and making any changes becomes very time consuming or even impossible. The fix is to constantly rewrite code so it makes more sense. This is called “refactoring”. 

But Alpha brushed me off, clearly not interested in excuses. My boss glanced at me with wide eyes. Once Alpha left, I asked my boss about the no-rewrite rule. 

Me: Boss, you do know I constantly rewrite code, right?

Boss: Yeah, what is his problem? Don’t worry about that for now, just do your job the way you decide.

This all took a great toll on my mental health, giving me a lot of stress. I got headaches from clenching my jaws, and had to take painkillers every night.

Later, Alpha complained about my people skills. My boss, knowing this was bullshit, decided he would be our contact person, shielding me from Alpha. He also contacted the client CEO, to talk about the communication difficulties. The CEO apologized and told Boss that Alpha had had a freakout with their own people recently, but had “promised” to behave. I also found out their hardware person, also managed by Alpha was on the verge of burning out.

Luckily for my mental health, I was needed on anther project, so an older colleague took over. We spent some time together, bringing him up to speed and solving issues he ran into. During one of these sessions, we ended up talking about my frustration. 

Me: It was hard, you know. I wanted to do my best, I take pride in my work. But he just wouldn’t let me succeed.

A wistful air somehow engulfed us, like sunlight through a window on a bleak November morning. He looked into my eyes, searching for something, like he was looking directly into my soul. 

Older Coworker: I remember what that was like. Feeling proud... Even these days, it still happens from time to time.

Me: So how do you handle it? The unreasonable demands? What is your trick?

Like a burst soap bubble, the moment was suddenly over and the wistfulness in his voice replaced by a somber tone. 

Older Coworker: When they won’t respect my professional opinion, I just stop giving a shit.

In the end, Alpha became so difficult to work with that my boss refused to work with him, and dropped the client.",1459,0,1
My computer Keeps Beeping," So, a few days ago I had a user that sent me a message that their camera was not working and that the computer keeps making beeping sounds, I was in the middle of a meeting, I told her to please send in a ticket and I would get back to her.

Never got a ticket, so I thought the user figured it out.

Today, I get another message from the user, asking for help.

I really wanted to tell them that “chat,is not submitting a ticket...”, but that was not a fight I wanted to have.
Give them a call and sure enough the windows (device connected / not connected)sound is singing away in the background. 

(I knew they were using whatever cheap docking station they had at home, cause COVID...)

Me: Okay, can you please disconnect
Everything you have connected to your laptop for me?  

User: The beeping stopped.  

Me: Okay, now please reconnect everything to your laptop again. 
  
User Okay, I have, and the beeping has stopped. And my external camera is working again.  

Me: Good, make sure you have everything firmly connected to your computer, as the “beeping” was the windows tone signaling that a device was connecting / disconnecting.   

User: Oh! Got it, thanks.  

Me: No problem.

I then created a ticket for the user, in the closing notes I wrote, please send in a ticket if you have additional questions in the future, but I doubt this user will the next time.",233,0,1
But...it doesn’t...NO!,"Long time lurker, on mobile so please excuse my errors.  I work in a small insurance company.

I am the only IT support for Windows in my office.  I have created multiple Spreadsheets in excel which even some Microsoft Professionals have said are nearly impossible. (Think database style program in a spreadsheet.)

Mind you, I am self taught out of self defense.  I had to learn all this to assist my bosses with running the business.  

This particular tale involves an Oracle Database Connection to one of our main programs.  The boss I work directly for (Dee for short) has her perfect baby (Jimmy) working as lead sales. 

Jimmy:  Hey OP, I need a report from XYZ system in excel, can you work your magic? 

Me: Sure, give me 25 minutes to modify a different Access Database to get that.

15 minutes later: 

Me: Hey Jimmy, is this what you were wanting?

Jimmy: Yeah, but the amount is missing for this column, you know showing that the employee is entitled to the max amount.

Me:  if this is a core benefit (Employer paid life insurance IS) we don’t keep track of the max in XYZ program.  They would need to refer to their a Plan Documents.

Jimmy: Can’t you just...like...program it so it puts that amount in?  

Me: Sure, for this group I can.  15 minutes and you can run funname.accdb and get you report.

2 hours later

Dee: OP can you come to my office please?

I arrive to find Dee and Jimmy waiting for me.

Jimmy:  OP, the program you wrote is wrong.

Me: Sorry, what is wrong?  I will gladly fix it.

Jimmy: I told you I wanted the max amount in this column. 

I run the database from Dee’s computer.

Me:  It is putting the max in for everyone.  What is the issue.

Jimmy starts the database and runs it using a DIFFERENT client than previously communicated.

Jimmy:  See it is putting in the wrong amount!  

Dee looks.

Dee:  I was in on the emails and he made it clear we need the max amounts for each employee.

Me: Yes, and I did explain we don’t track that in XYZ program.  I hardcoded the amount for Client A.  He is running it for Client C.

Jimmy:  Can’t you get anything right? Just fix it.

Me: Okay, but since we have over 200 clients, it will take me about 8 hours, and every time you Jimmy change the max for a company it will take an additional 30-45 minutes.

Dee:  I think OP has better things to do.  The employee can look in their Plan Documents.  OP go back to your desk, I think you have work to do.

Clear the Money,"I'm sure by the title some of you may know where this is going. But it's short and sweet and it definitely made me chuckle. 

Quick backstory: Sys Support for large medical supplier. We have a known issue on the website with item searches turning up blank results. The work around (until the devs feel like figuring it out) is to clear the cache. 

A nurse calls encountering the aforementioned issue. I remote in and am trying to clear her cache but for some reason their internal IT has it blocked. While I am on the phone with her she calls their IT helpdesk on a different phone and has us on speaker together. I start telling him what needs to done, etc. I'm trying to do this while the nurse is also (unnecessarily) trying to explain what she needs to do. Then it happens. 

Me: 'blah blah blah, clearing the cache will allow her to search again, yada yada yada'

Nurse: ""She just needs you to clear the money""

Me: lets out a very slight chuckle as I try not to literally LOL

Other tech: pure silence because either he didn't hear it or, as I like to imagine, he was having the same reaction as me.

So that's it for my morning so far. Fingers crossed nothing too annoying happens today. Have a good day everyone :)",352,0,1
"A successfully skirting of all rules, with a very cooperative customer.","Alright, buckle up peeps, the booze has been flowing, and I just remembered this story. long time lurker, first time post whatnot… you know how it is. Language warning (again… booze). TLDR at the bottom.

The Cast:

Me: Duh

Dude: the customer

QA: Quality Assurance Reviewer

DM: Dumb Manager


The scene:

Like normal, this story is from YEARS ago... I had just been fired from Blockbuster, so I took the next available position, a third party call center for a large ISP. You know the one, the one everyone loves to hate. It was brutal. Shit rolls down hill, and we were at the absolute bottom of the hill. The company went out of business damn near 10 years ago, so I hope this isn’t still happening to customers.

So, we’re first line support, customers have to go through us in order to talk to someone that works for the company they pay out the nose for. Customer’s first was plastered all over the hallways.

Now, I had the dream shift of 4x 10 hour shifts, split two days on, one off, two on. It was amazing at the time, but near the end of a ten hour shift, it got a little grating.
We also had “totally attainable goals and metrics”… no more than 4 minutes sign on/off outside your shift, no more than 15 minutes for breaks, 4 calls “qualitied” (reviewed by a QA person) per week, and the kicker… a 4:15 average call time. Can you fix someone’s connectivity in less than 4 mintues? I’d like to see you try. Anyway… now for the call.


&lt;beep&gt;

&gt;Dude: hey, before you say your thing, please say you actually work for $company

&gt;Me: (per script), Yes I represent $company, how may I help you?

&gt;Dude: Jesus Christ, still not a real employee. Can I be real with you? This is my fourth call, and my router isn’t the problem, I don’t need someone to come out, and I don’t want to be put on hold. I run IT for a small company, and have two identical laptops, one can connect to the internet, the other one can’t. Are you down for trying to find the problem with me?

&gt;Me: This sounds like an interesting problem, but is out of the scope of your service’s terms and agreements. My official word on this matter is that I cannot support third party hardware. However, in the case that we get disconnected, may I have your phone number in the unfortunate case we are disconnected?

&gt;Dude: huh… interesting my number is ___

&gt;Me: Just making sure I have this right &lt;repeats number&gt; **---UNPLUGS PHONE---** (more on this later **)

--PHONE REBOOTS &amp; I call the customer back—

&gt;Dude: Hello?

&gt;Me: This is $me with $company, we got disconnected.

&gt;Dude: holy cow, you actually called me back, that’s a new one. So what’s the deal?

&gt;Me: let’s troubleshoot this…



We go through all the standard troubleshooting step by step:

Can we ping out on both? – Yes

Can we reach $company website on both – No

Internet options exactly the same on both? – no, a few minutes later and a reboot, yes, still no dice

Got him to download another internet browser on the working laptop, move it to disk, and install it on his other laptop – no go…

We get into adapter settings to make sure we’ve got exactly the same adapter models – Yes, we do.

Not only are the settings and options set the same on both laptops, they are identical down to the hardware. The motherboard serial numbers are 1 single digit apart, these things might as well be the same machine.

&gt;Me:  Honestly, we’ve been on the phone for a while, and I’m at a loss. The one laptop proves we’ve got absolutely perfect working connection, it’s not hardware, it’s not settings, I’m literally at the end of the line on what I can think of.

&gt;Dude: You have actually been the most thorough, educated, and helpful person I’ve been on the phone with. 

&gt;Me: the only thing I can think of next would be to…

&gt;Dude: yeah, it’s time to reinstall windows

&gt;Me: yup, I know it's extreme...

&gt;Dude: I've got the disks handy, but before I do that, I want to try one thing with you, the one that doesn’t have internet has this dumb weather app, do you think that could be it?

&gt;Me: that seems so incredibly dumb, what $app is it?

&gt;Dude: It's this annoying weather $app, it keeps like the 10 day forecast and makes ladybugs appear randomly when you accidentally click on it.

&gt;Me: The guy sitting next to me has that installed, he was just telling me about all it’s cool features, gimme a second. (to cube mate: when’s your break? Now? Can I use your PC while your on it? Hell yeah dude). I’ve got access to that app, want to walk through the settings with me? Keep in mind that we've been on phone for a while, it's totally up to you to see if it works.

&gt;Dude: holy shit, really? Let's do this. Don't hang up on me, I want you on the line through this whole thing. There's no way I'd call back and get you again.

--furious usage of strange weather app ensues—

&gt;Me: everything I’ve got on this end matches what you’ve got on your end, and still you can’t connect to the internet. The computer I’m on is working just fine.

&gt;Dude: we’ve been at this for a long ass time, do you want to give up and kick me off the phone?

&gt;Me: In all honesty, you were cool, so after I got your call back number, I unplugged my phone in order to end the call. I called you back because our outgoing calls don’t count towards our metrics, so you’ve got me as long as you want to talk. ** (told you there was going to be on this later, did you think I forgot?)

&gt;Dude: You sure? that’s brilliant by the way, this call would have tanked your metrics. I want to try and uninstall this stupid weather app.

&gt;Me: Let’s do it

--one long uninstall and reboot later—

&gt;Me: so, skip to the meat of it, can we get to $company website?

&gt;Dude: holy hell, we did it. It was that stupid weather app this whole god damn time.

&gt;Me: anything else I can do for you?

&gt;Dude: I’d love to speak to your supervisor… this has been an epic journey and would love to put in a good word for you.

&gt;Me: that’s not needed, and usually takes more than an hour to get one on the phone, even if I can physically see walking the hallways.

&gt;Dude: okay cool, have a good day.


---the aftermath, or pt2.... oddly set 4 days later—

“All calls are recorded for call quality and training” isn’t fake, the call system automatically recorded calls, up until (surprise!) that 4:15 average call time limit. Any call past 4:15 was automatically deleted. Apparently, there just wasn’t space on the servers for anything longer. Because of the 4x10 shift I was on, it was hard for the 5x8 quality team to find me, somehow because I came in before them, left after them, and was there for 4/5 of the days they worked. Whatever. I'm normally REALLY long on calls, partly to avoid the QA team because they kind of suck, but also because call time is the one metric I can't get fired for. The calls under 4:15 have to be perfect, but it's a game to me.

So my ~3 minute phone call with this guy, up until I yank out my phone cord is what gets reviewed.

&gt;QA: that’s quite a suspicious cut off on the call, it sounded like you were messing with your phone, and then the call ended, I think you pulled out your cord.

&gt;Me: you can see from the notes that I properly logged the phone call as being disconnected, and managed to call him back

&gt;QA: also suspicious, calling out isn’t counted towards your metrics

&gt;Me: really? I didn’t know that!

--QA rolls eyes at my fake surprise and calls in DM—

&gt;DM: what’s up?

&gt;QA: $Me pulled the plug on his only QA call for the period

&gt;DM: did he get a call back number?

&gt;QA: well yeah, but…

&gt;DM: (to $me) did you call him back?

&gt;ME: Yes, and I resolved his issue.

&gt;DM: (to QA) is that what the ticket says?

&gt;QA: yes, but…

&gt;DM: Let’s call the customer and settle this… write down the number from the recording... !TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM!


--in the conference room—

&gt;DM: Hello $dude, this is $DM from $company, you had a call with $me a while ago, it looks like it got cut off, did $me end up calling you back?

&gt;Dude: what? $me? I called $company about a pair of laptops, maybe I talked to a $me

&gt;DM: most importantly, did your problem get resolved?

&gt;ME: It’s $me, for context we’re talking about the issue with $app

&gt;Dude: HOLY SHIT $ME… YOU ARE AN ABSOLUTE SAINT, THAT WAS THE MOST ABSOLUTE BAT SHIT PROBLEM EVER.

&gt;DM: $cough, seems $me certainly helped out $dude

&gt;Dude: yeah, I was on the phone with $me for like two hours, it was epic. $me deserves a fucking raise if you do that sort of thing around whatever company you work for, because we all know you don’t get that kind of service from $company

&gt;DM: uh, Thanks?

--wrapping it up—

&gt;DM: So, that settles it, full marks for customer rapport, and making it a one-call resolution.

&gt;ME: thanks, and do I get a customer comment card reward for his feedback?

&gt;DM: &lt;&lt;shocked Pikachu&gt;&gt;…No actually, your call time…

&gt;QA (now with a twinkle in their eye): which was outbound so doesn’t count

&gt;DM: *cough* your following protocol for telling the customer we don’t’ work for $company

&gt;QA: which he never did, the customer came to that part himself, we have that part recorded

&gt;DM: *cough* your, uh, um... fine. You get the customer comment award this week.

"""Um, you didn't try the brightness buttons before you took the PC apart, did you?""","I recently started a job at your friendly neighborhood computer repair shop. This particular story revolves around a laptop with the usual ""C/S machine powers on but screen is black"" ticket. I received the ticket, powered on the PC to confirm the black screen, and saw an image but with no backlight. I relay this across the desk to my boss, who came over, looked at it, and said ""Yep! That's a bad backlight!"" and then showed me the procedure for ordering a new screen.

Meanwhile I get sidetracked with a different task, and he begins disassembly of the PC.

Eventually the part arrives, but Boss is out of the office that day, so I'm the only one in the PC repair department. I grab the PC from the back, replace the screen, and get a nice little dopamine shot when I see that the new screen works as intended and I haven't broken anything in the process.

So I'm fiddling around with the screen, testing it. I move the mouse, log in and get on the internet. I have achieved victory!

Then I mess with the brightness buttons, moving it from its brightest to darkest setting. As the brightness hits its lowest setting, *my heart drops*.

The backlight shuts off. 

Apparently on this model of PC, you can completely shut off the backlight. I had never considered this to be a possibility. It's totally impossible to read the screen without the backlight, so.... What use case could anyone ever have for this??? 

I sheepishly text my boss: 

\&gt;Me: Hey, sorry to bother you on your day off but, did you happen to mess with the brightness keys on this ticket before you took it apart? Apparently you can completely shut off  the backlight on this model for some reason

\&gt;Boss: No, I didn't know you could do that.

I'm reeling. What if the screen worked the entire time, and we just never thought to hit the ""increase brightness"" key? What if we cost this guy all this money, had his computer away from him for all this time, and did all this work because we just didn't think to hit the button to increase brightness?

The guy had to have mashed the brightness buttons at least a couple times before he thought to take it in to a shop, right? I don't know, we all know how end users are. The PC is already reassembled at this point so I'll never know if that screen was truly faulty. This will keep me awake for the rest of my life, cold sweats running down my face. I'll never know...

Three short tales,"**Keyboards are too diffiult**

First one was a phone call I got this morning. A user had misplaced the URL to one of our webapps.

So I started telling her: Go to [www.thisisyourapp.com/cms](https://www.thisisyourapp.com/cms)

She starts typing and halfway through she says ""I just don't understand this"". So, patiently I direct her ""Just type [www.thisisyourapp.com/cms](https://www.thisisyourapp.com/cms)"". Which thankfully she managed on the second try. And she logged in afterwards.

**The case of the mismatched password**

A user mailed me from her private account that she had trouble logging in to her company e-mail. She didn't know her password. So I reset her password to some random string of symbols and numbers and sent it over to her. I think it was something along the lines of  =/=THQ84!

I got an email back from her: ""I typed in THQ84 and it doesn't work. I don't know why!""

I told her that she needed to type in the password exactly and haven't heard from her since.

**Message in a bottle**

This one's still ongoing technically. I got en email in the helpdesk ""I have a question about how to work in google drive can you contact me?""

No idea what the question is, so I reply: ""As per your request I'm contacting you via e-mail. What is your question?""

Because really fuck that nonsense.",142,0,1
Why would they even make that button?,"So I'm not Tech Support by trade. I'm a Network Engineer but as a person in a technical job that makes me support for all technology for everyone I've ever met. I try to fend it off and succeed most of the time but close friends and family sometimes slip through the cracks. This happened last weekend and made me think of this sub.

A friend of mine was coming over to hang out and asked if she could bring her laptop. Her college needed her to be on camera for the entirety of her final and she tried to test her camera and it wouldn't turn on.

To her credit she tried a bunch of things including factory reset. None of this worked. I assumed it was a faulty driver and all I would need to do was download a new driver and call it good.

A half hour into the laptop telling me the camera is unavailable and me trying to figure out why the drivers aren't showing up on the device manager I decide to check the BIOS.

Of course she doesn't know what key boots to BIOS I start mashing the usual suspects. On my second attempt I look at the keys and see a blue camera icon under the F8 key. 

At this point I give up on BIOS and literally, physically facepalm.

Of course the laptop has function keys to shut off hardware. Because why wouldn't it.

So after booting into Windows and hitting function + F8 I open the webcam manager and show her it works. I then proceeded to show her everything that the function keys can shut off in case she runs into a similar problem again.

Now my shame is public and I accept the ridicule.",191,0,1
"""Right-click on my trackpad isn't working! I'm completely unable to work!"" -The woman with a USB mouse attached","Literally just got off the phone with this woman.

Client: ""My trackpad is broken and I'm completely stuck! Please fix it!""

Me: ""Ok, are you able to type on the keyboard as well? Is it just the trackpad that's not functioning?""

Client: ""Yeah, the keyboard works fine, and I can move the mouse around on the trackpad, I just can't right-click.""

Me: ""Do you happen to have a USB mouse nearby we can use in the meantime?""

Client: ""Yes, I do."" *wiggles mouse, cursor moves*

Me: ""Oh, it's attached already?""

Client: ""Well, yeah it's my mouse.""

Me: ""I just want to clarify, right-click isn't working on the trackpad or the mouse?""

Client: ""The trackpad. I right click when using our programs, I can't work without it.""

Me: ""Does right-click work on the USB mouse?""

Client: ""I haven't tried. Should I?""

Me: ""Yes please."" 

*Right click works*

Me: ""So if right click isn't working on the trackpad, it's possible it's a hardware issue and we'll have to contact Dell for a warranty repair. I'll get the ball rolling on that and let you know what the next steps are.""

Client: ""So I'm just not supposed to be able to work?""

Me: ""No, you should be able to work just fine. You---""

Client: ""I CAN'T WORK WITHOUT MY TRACKPAD, MR. IT.""

Me: ""Ma'am, you have a working mouse in your hand. You can work using that.""

Client: ""...""

Me: ""...""

Client: ""Ok, so you'll let me know about the warranty thing?""

Me: ""Yes ma'am. I'll send you a follow up email with all the next steps.""

Client: ""K thank you. Bye.""

This job is hilarious sometimes.",1364,0,1
Nobody wants to follow instructions,"Recent stories of simple fixes held up by unwilling users reminded me of a story I experienced a long time ago.  My previous job I was a field tech for a copy/print/ship company.  We were less than Level 1 really, we did the physical troubleshooting and deployment stuff for the most part on a regular visit cycle to each retail store.

This takes place well over a decade ago, close to 15 years ago.  I was based out of Downtown Los Angeles, somewhere between the Disney Concert Hall and Staples Center.  I had a nice little office I created out of an old storage room on the second floor of the building we were in.  One Friday afternoon I get a call from my boss, a regional tech.

&gt;Boss: Hey are you available to go to $notyourlocation to take a look at a network problem?  All of the rental computers are down there.

At the time each VLAN was a physically separate switch.  I don't know if it was that way out of paranoia or because they couldn't do VLANs per port on the equipment but we had multiple switches per site dedicated to their own VLAN.  The rental computers (you could come in and use our computers to do whatever and we'd charge you per minute plus printing) all were on their own separate switch.

&gt;Me: Sure, but it's Friday and they're not close.  Traffic is going to be a pain to get out there.  I probably won't get out there until close to 5 so are you approving OT?

&gt;Boss: No don't worry about it.  They haven't opened a ticket, they just called me and I told them to open a ticket.  Plus they're refusing to troubleshoot with me over the phone so let them wait.  When I see the ticket I'll let you know.

So I waited, and it got closer to when it'd take me close to 2 hours to get to this place.  Finally my boss calls back.

&gt;Boss: The ticket just came in, it's too late now.  Please go there on Monday first thing and take care of it.  I'm pretty sure it's an easy fix but since we can't see anything it's hard to say.

So on Monday I drive out to this location I've never been to before.  Introduce myself to the Assistant Manager on duty and she gets the key to open the network closet.  This location had a big room for the network, 3 dual post racks with the switches in the middle rack.

I look at the 3com switch (all of the rental computers were on the 3com switch, everything else was on HP switches) and all of the lights are on, solid on, no blinking and the fans are spinning.  I walk around the racks to the back of the switches and press the red button next to the power cord to reset the switch.  Walk back around to lights coming up and blinking.  I wait a couple of minutes and go back out to the computer area.  Sure enough every computer now says ""Online"".  I let the Assistant Manager know the problem is solved.

&gt;Assistant Manager: What did you do?  Your boss was talking to us on the phone on Friday but we didn't understand what he wanted.

She follows me back to the network room, follows me around the racks and I point to the red reset button.

&gt;Me: I pressed this button to reset it.  I could have just pulled the power cord out and plugged it back in too but the button is easier.

I called my boss and he laughed.
&gt;Boss: I told them on Friday what to do and they refused to do it.  I wonder how much in lost sales they had over the weekend.",234,0,1
You don't know how my account is setup!!,"So... Today was eventful. Language warning.
I received a call from a colleague at a different support desk (I work in a large MSP with multiple offices/client bases).

Me - duh

OE - Other Engineer

Knob - customer



T-Minus 15 minutes until the end of my shift: *Phone rings*

Me - Hey dude, you alright?

OE - Yeah mate, got this dude on the line from $company, won't listen to me, can you speak some sense into him?

Now a short backstory:
$company moved to the other desk for dedicated support, but previously were one of the customers that I supported.

Knob - Hello, yes ticket number is xx-xx-xx

Me - Perfect just pulling that up. It says here that you say that you bought a Microsoft 365 E3 license when you started at the company? 

Knob - Yes!! That's what I explained to OE! Local IT told me to buy it on $notcompany domain.

Me - Sir looking at your 365 account here, you definitely don't have an E3 license, you only have an E1 license.

(Not unheard of, but definitely not usual. E1 licenses come with Exchange for emails and not much else, no Word or Excel)

Knob - Well I can't open Word, it tells me that I need an extra license. I renewed it last week!

Me - Well by the looks of it, you've bought a license on your own tenant, not one that we manage. $company should be giving you an E3 license if you need access to Word. I can contact the local IT team if you need us to apply this for you. An E1 license doesn't come with Word.

Knob - NO!!!! I renewed the license last week!!!!! My account should have one on it already!!

Me - Sir, $company will provide the license for you, you don't need to spend your own money on it.

Knob - You don't know how my account is setup! This is fucking bullshit! I'm going to speak to local IT!

Me - They'll tell you the same thing that I have told you. I am not sure why they didn't provide the license for you, but they definitely wouldn't have told you to buy one.

Knob - They did! They said it was a requirement when I started!

Me - well I'll have to leave this to onsite to handle. Have a nice day.

Knob - Not fucking happy.....

*Click*

I have no idea what he wanted me to do to be honest, he bought it on his own will and $company is renowned for being the reason for the word PEBCAK existing.

Muppet.


TL;DR: dude buys his own M365 license and gets angry because he won't accept that he bought the wrong license and that we can't help him as it's not our tenant.",261,0,1
How to go From FOM to Jail in 5 hours," 

This tale is long, and I hope you forgive for the length.

This tale is set in the time of COVID

It would not have been written without the strong encouragement of the users of the tales from the front desk discord

The player are the following

Texan= Me

NG= New Girl

BB=Front office Manager (in charge of the front desk)

OS= Owner Son

O= Owner

FD=Front desk staff

GM= General Manager

AGM= Assistant General Manager

Guest=Hotel Guest

This day started like any other day I awake and jump in the shower, I jump out and check my phone and notice that there are 45 Emails from this morning alone from BB asking if I am awake and on the property to assist guest with their Wi-Fi connection issues and electronic doodads, I respond back to her latest email stating that per ( email I sent yesterday I do not do guest IT support unless I have time and sadly today I do not.)

Texan=I go down from my hotel room to my office, upon reaching there I am greeted by a line of people who BB sent for me to provide support to. Bypassing the signs that said employees only and Access restricted.

After helping the guest’s connect there craptops to the Wi-Fi network I start on my project for the day which was to do a network audit and find out exactly how janked up the network was from being hobbled together and held together by prayer and silly string with no IT staff for twenty years and every computer /user having local admin access.

(Get a knock on my door from a hotel guest)

Texan: How may I help you?

Guest: uh BB said to come see you about getting my firestick to connect to the hotel Wi-Fi.

Texan: OH, I am sorry BB was incorrect. While it is true that I help guest with Wi-Fi issues on days I am not busy or slammed with work. Sadly, today I have too much to do today but I can see what I can do to assist you. Is it giving you any sort of error?

Guest: no BB told me to come here first before I tried to connect it to the network)

Texan: (Gosh Darn its BB) Guest please try to connect and if you have any trouble feel free to go to the FD to ask for help

Texan: (types email reminds BB that I do not do Guest IT support as I am regional IT Support for the 11 Hotels that owner owns)

BB: Responds to my email with the following (How dare I. She a FOM and I am a lowly regional IT Tech she will not direct the front desk staff to stop sending guest for any tech related issues to my office as I don’t have any authority over her since you’re a regional IT tech and I am a FOM of this property and I rank lower than her on the COC (chain of command).

Texan: I respond with the following email(Per my last request dated (yesterday date) requesting you to instruct the front desk staff to not send guest to my office for support with connecting there electronic devices to the Wi-Fi. And per your response dated yesterday date stating that you refuse to comply as you are above me per your email sent yesterday (email attached). I have no choice but to escalate this as the customers are breaching a secure area which breaks a couple dozen different security regulations and business regulations. I am unable to ensure that appropriate measures are being taken for the security of the computer hardware and such will be forced to if measures are not taken to resolve the security lapses Remove the ability to take credit card and other sensitive financial data due to lack of security ) per brand name security regulations which clearly state that PCI data and other sensitive data must be secure and all computer hardware must be locked down to prevent theft) per your response of refusing to do so because I am just a “regional it tech” and per your email I am below you. I am CCing your manager on this email (AGM and the GM to inform them of this fact that it measures are not taken I will be forced to remove the ability to process credit card payments per brand name regulations and other business regulations)

Texan: I go out into my little lobby area to sign for the delivery of the new WIFI AP and network hardware. And see AGM and GM walking into BB office with murder in their eyes)

BB (starts sweating and yelling at AGM and GM about how she was not consulted on my hire and as a manager she should have been consulted)

GM: Texan operates at a regional level the owner hired him as a field IT Tech

BB: Texan should report to me since I am a FOM and I am MANAGEMENT while he is just a TECH

AGM: BB Texan only reports to the owner or the owner son no one else. He was doing you curtesy by assisting the guest YOU sent to his office even thought HE told you he was to busy today to assist guest as he is upgrading the computer and the network here.

BB: that does not seem fair. He a regional tech he should be below me and have to report to me and he should do what I tell him to do including assisting guest with there Wi-Fi issues

AGM: He does not have to do that he is above you in fact I think if he wanted to he could fire anyone here and I could not stop it I think as he is the equivalent of a regional director.

BB: Texan should not be allowed to say no to me, and he should help every guest I send to his office and swipe in

GM: (calls every front desk agent into BB office)

NG: prints out the email I sent and then BB email telling them to ignore me as I have no “authority” and I am below her in rank

BB: NG you are supposed to be on my side why would you print out the emails

AGM: reads the paper NG handed her and asks BB for her response

BB: Texan is below is me in authority I am not going to tell me front desk staff to not send guest into an employee only area for tech support. That what Texan was hired for anyways (I was not)

GM: BB since you can’t understand how serios this is I am going to demote you to front desk agent 1 at front desk agent 1 pay scale (12$ an hour demotion )

(Shortly thereafter about an hour or so) I hear from the front desk BB complaining that Texan Cost her job and does loyalty not matter anymore she spent 10 years with the hotel as a FOM?

Texan:( Notices in the span of 10 minutes there are 10 P1 tickets in the que from BB saying she is unable to stream Netflix or Hulu on her phone) (P1 tickets are all hand on deck major system outage and or check in system offline not for trivial matters) all P1 tickets are sent to the anyone above an AGM at the property in question including the owner and his son and starts a 15 minute response window

BB starts yelling at NG for not defending her in there and placing the blame on her and saying that she is a bad employee for CYA. (in front of I would say about 10 guests)

NG: runs away crying to the lady’s room

Guest: Ask BB may I please speak to the AGM or GM

BB: asks what for

Guest: your conduct and your pettiness and airing your dirty laundry in front of people checking in

BB: (shocked Pikachu face) and summons the GM to the front counter

OS: calls me and ask what these P1 tickets are about since there where 10 in in 10 minutes time

GM: chews out BB for bad mouthing me in front of guests

OS: I am coming to the hotel to straighten this out

(short while later) OS arrives

OS: (goes into the former FOM office and calls the GM and BB into it)

BB: start defending her actions and saying she was within her right as management and she deserves to be FOM

OS: is not buying it

Bb: is fighting with the GM and OS saying she should have been consulted on the hiring of an IT person since it within range of here “responsibility” (it is not)

OS: is saying that that is his dad’s responsibility to hire for IT

BB: is saying that that do not matter as a Hotel management she is above all regional staff

OS: that is bull shit she was only hired as a favor to the GM. And as part of the hiring of the GM he had to hire his wife

OS: per the contract you were only supposed to be kept hired as long as you and your husband where married and he worked for us you had a job

OS: But thank you for letting us know that you guys are not married

OS: We can settle this

OS: One of two ways you are fired and ill paid the rest of your shift with your FOM pay

OS: OR you are demoted to overnight FD and only if you apologize to Texan

OS: you have your choices you have 30 seconds to make it

BB: what do I have to do to get my FOM job back?

OS: you will never get FOM again you abused regional staff and abused network access and privilege. You bad mouthed regional staff in front of guest and caused us to have at least 10 complaints sent to brand about us

OS: your 30 seconds are up what do you choose

BB: are there any manager positions I can have?

OS: make your choice

BB: I guess I will take night desk

Bb: can I get my old pay back?

OS: ok you are on probation and if I hear you causing ANY trouble, I will personally fire you. IF there is even a single compliant about, I will fire you. Do you understand?

OS: I will tell IT to reinstate your access and NG is the new FOM

BB: fuck that bitch I quit

OS: ok well thank you for serving (company for 10 years) we will mail you your final paycheck. You have 5 minutes to pack your desk and locker before security will escort you off the property

BB: was escorted off the property and returned later and proceeded to destroy about 1.500 dollars’ worth of computer equipment and may or may not have bit a cop.

Texan: Coming back from taking a lunch/dinner break and notices that there are 2 police cars parked at the front door.

Texan: (wonders what happened and who called the police officers? And grumbles that someone stole his parking spot)

BB: going savage on computer equipment and trying to break down the door of the IT closet

Texan: just my luck I came back at the wrong time. (I Wonder if it too late to slip out to my truck and escape)

BB: gets arrested (surprise Pikachu ) and fights with the arresting officers and may or may not have bit a cop while she was being dragged to the squad car",3737,2,1
The Divine Tech Support,"I don't work in tech support, but people often ask me for help, since, IT is my speciality. This story happened last year.

One evening, around 10:30 PM I receive **a text message** from A.

A: Hey M, I have a problem. I've connected my desktop PC with my TV via HDMI to watch a movie on big screen. *(I've seen the TV, it's like 50 inces, ridiculous)* But the sound won't go through the TV, it still goes over PC's speakers.

M: That happens sometimes. If you wan't I can come in a minute, it's easier for me to do it in person. 

*You guys know how hard it is to do it remotely, but over text...*

A: Better not, my parents are asleep and I don't want to wake them up, they get mad easily.

M: Why would we wake them up?

A: Never mind that, while I explain the situation, they'd send me to bed. Can't you explain it to me like this?

*His parents have met me, they're good people and know that I am to. I suspect he has a girl over, so he's making excuses. That's fair.*

M: Hahah, okay. Let me think for a moment.

M: Now, I haven't done this before, but there are two possible solutions. Try this first. It's Windows 7, right?

A: Yes

*I knew it. He refuses to upgrade, is a bit lasy. But he'll call me for that too.*

M: Right click on the speaker icon in bottom right corner. Then Volume mixer. Is there an option by the main switch to choose the sound source?

A: Yes, like an arrow.

M: Try it.

"Where's the ""1"" key","A couple of years ago while working for an MSP I took a call from a medical center we supported. The user was having problems logging in. Whenever her password needed to be changed this particular user was notorious  for badgering our techs into just setting the password as the same password every time. I was not overly opposed to this but when I reviewed the account I explained HIPAA regulations and that her password had to change. We agreed to the same password with the number 1 after it (seriously I didn't need to put in another 30 minutes to get her to pick another password). After she agreed, I changed the password for her (not worth the added time to get her to enter it twice). I asked her to login and she kept saying the password wasn't accepted. I connected to her computer and counted the characters she had typed. Once I figured out she had left the 1 off of her password I pointed out to her that she needed to press the number 1 on her keyboard. Her response: ""Where is that"". This was not a laptop or any special type of keyboard. This was your typical Dell keyboard with a 1 in the top row of the keyboard and on the number pad. Since her number lock was likely off, I decided to direct her to the top row of her keyboard. After a minute or two of explaining it was above the letter Q she finally found it. Once she logged in I closed the ticket and took a very long break.",313,0,1
"A secretary's ""features"" were activating unwanted features on the equipment.","Think this one is from the year 2k, back when most of the copiers we serviced were still analog and had actual buttons for all the different features.


We got a call from a church saying that the copier was malfunctioning when they tried to use it. It would duplex copies or zoom when none of that was selected, other random stuff as well. When dispatched to a call our standard troubleshooting procedure was to ask the person who had the issue exactly what happened when they used the machine and then try to get the same error/issue and go from there.

When I arrived at the church only the pastor was there and he told me the secretary was the one having issues, he explained basically the same thing from the call. Random things were happening when the secretary used the copier, he had not had any issues.

I give the copier a once over, checked to make sure all the features were working properly, checked the main wear and tear sections (feed rollers, PM counts, etc), gave it a quick clean up and couldn't find anything wrong with it. Showed the pastor it was working the way it was supposed to and closed the call.

Next day we get a call back for the exact same thing. Again I headed out to the church to be greeted by only the pastor. Repeat of yesterday, all features worked correctly. Showed the pastor again, no issues and closed the call. I asked the pastor if it happened again to please make sure the secretary would be there since she was the only one having issues and gave him my cell number (yes, I know worst tech move ever. Never give a customer your cell number)

On the way back to the office my cell rang and it was the secretary. She was rather upset (I'm being polite with that description), the machine was still having issues. I told her I'm only about 40 minutes away and asked if she would please stay until I got there so she could show me exactly what was happening. She said yes and I pulled a U turn while calling the boss to give an update.

When I arrived at the church I finally got to meet the secretary and have her tell me exactly what was happening. It was the same issue the pastor described.
*slight eye twitch*

The following conversation is what I can remember, it's not verbatim but it's the general conversation in total.

M: Me
S: Secretary

M: Ok, what exactly do you want the copier to do?

S: I want to make copies of this and have it do XYZ

M: Ok, let me try and make the copies for you.

I set it up to do what she wants and lo and behold... it does exactly that...

S: What the? It always messes up when I do it. What did you do?

*urge to beat head off wall rising*

M: I just loaded the document, pushed X, Y, and Z, told it how many to make, and pressed start.

S: That's what I do, but it keeps messing up.

*sigh*

M: Ok, why dont you show me exactly what you do when you make a copy.

She got up from her desk, came over, programmed the copier, put her document in the feeder and hit start. Lo and behold it did random things. 

At this point I FINALLY knew what was happening. Now the secretary was about 5' 5"" and had rather large shall we say ""features"". When she stepped forward to put the document in the feeder, said ""features"" were pressing the copiers buttons that controlled its features, thus causing the randomness.

*internal monologue* OH BOY... how do I address this... think think... ok...

M: I think I know what's going on. First when you go to make copies put the document in first, then step back and press reset, then setup what you want the copier to do and press start from here (standing about 6"" away from the control panel).

S: You mean I'm standing to close? How is that causing the issue?

*internal scream* SHIT!

M: Tell you what, show me exactly what you do again when you make copies.

S: FINE! (She was definitely getting pissed off)

She setup the copier and put the document in the feeder

M: Stop

S: WHAT?!?

M: Um, look down...

She looks down and it took about 10-20 seconds of her looking down till it sunk in.

S: OH MY GOD! *face beet red* How are you going to write this up? Please dont say, well... THAT!

*side hurting from holding laughter*

M: Tell you what, I'll just say it was a training error and that I showed you how to set the features correctly. That sound ok?

S: Lord yes.

I wrote up my paperwork, got in the car, drove about a block, parked and started cry laughing. She was so embarrassed and apologetic while I wrote up the paperwork. Never told any of the other techs in case they ever went there. Didn't want to embarrass the poor woman anymore then what she got that day. I can still see her bright red face everytime I think of this story.",3004,0,1
Another will work for food/booze story from my local market .. could have been epic but no big deal thankfully,"So about a week ago a mentally ill person basically attacked my local market/liquor store/deli about 2:00 in the morning breaking out the windows and tearing down the point of sale in the liquor store side.. which is impressive since another buddy of mine built it .. heavy duty.

So the locals in the town managed to subdue the person without too much injury (Buckey got a cut thumb from the guy who also had a shovel he was swinging around).  Nobody got shot.. the police finally came after like 40 mins and didn't shoot anyone either.. thankfully.. and the fellow was sent to mental health services somewhere.  Best of luck to them.

Anyway.. the point of sale in the liquor side is a mish mash of Ethernet piped in from his office through the walls.. the guy tore it all out.  They got it all put back together but couldn't get enough lines to run all the stuff.. my buddy calls me in.  I brought my tester and all this expecting to rebuild cables.. maybe run new ones? Who knows what stress those cables got or damage to equipment .. could be anything.. so I go in hot

The'd got a few of the systems working by the time I got there by talking to vendors tech support but were lacking 2 connections.  Hours and hours on tech support etc and no go.. something is seriously wrong.. thus my call

All those are down are connected to a basic switch .. which got unplugged during the rumble.  I tested all the connections.. and then.. plugged it back in to the wall .. and KABLAM.. you are a GENIUS OMG why didn't we call you sooner ;0
it took like 30 mins at the most.. so i got a huge deli sandwich and a bottle of lairds applejack as compensation and a few bucks.

Remember kids.. if the lights aren't on .. check the power ;0

You feel like a fraud when they all think you are so smart for plugging something in.. but what the fuck right? It's a job",165,0,1

&gt;Me: ""OK, what's going on with the computer.""

&gt;User: ""Well, it's just at a blue screen and we can't see any of the patient rooms.""

&gt;Me: ""OK, can you reboot the computer for me?""

&gt;User: ""I've already done that.""

&gt;Me: ""Let's do it again.""

&gt;User: *5 seconds later*  ""OK, it's done.""

&gt;Me: *to myself* ""Of course she would restart the monitor""  *to the user*  ""Now, you did that by clicking the start button and clicking restart?""

&gt; User: ""Yes.""

&gt; Me: ""... OK, what's it doing now?""

&gt; User: ""It's still just the blue screen and it doesn't show any of the patient rooms.""

&gt; Me: ""Close the program for me.""

&gt;User: ""OK.""

&gt;Me: ""Now re-open it and tell me what it does.""

&gt; User: ""It's the same thing.""

&gt; Me: ""OK, I'm going to come in and see what it looks like.  It's going to take me about half an hour to get there.""

&gt; User: ""OK, thank you.""

So I get up, get dressed, and drive to the hospital.  I make my way to the kitchen and walk over to the computer that they're having trouble with.  The blue screen she was talking about?

Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to log in

I stared at it for a few seconds, then logged their user in.  The user walked over at this point, saw the desktop load, and asked:

&gt;User: ""What did you do?""

&gt;Me: ""I logged in.""

&gt;User: ""What do you mean?""

&gt;Me: ""I mean I logged into the computer with the password you guys use to log in.""

&gt;User: ""Oh, well, I don't know anything about no password.""

After spending all of one minute in their kitchen, I said ""Have a good day"", walked out, groaned loudly in frustration, and went to my office to type several drafts of an email to their manager before settling on the following: 

&gt;[Manager], this morning [User] called reporting an issue with the computer in the kitchen.  The only thing she could tell me over the phone was that there was a blue screen and she couldn’t see any rooms.  I asked her to restart the computer and it sounded like she powered the monitor off and on.  I asked her to close the software and she said she did, and when I asked her to re-open the software she said it was back to the blue screen and she couldn’t see any rooms.  I assumed this meant she was in [software] and that it wasn’t working correctly, so I drove to the hospital to take a look.  
 
&gt;The problem ended up being that there was apparently a power outage last night and the computer had restarted and was waiting for them to log in to Windows.  The employees were apparently not aware that they needed to hit Ctrl+Alt+Del to log in to the computer before using it.  Please disseminate this information to all the [food service company] employees so this sort of issue can be avoided in the future.",294,0,1
User thinks that the computer should know who is using it without logging in!! :(,"I work for a place where my primary assignment is not I.T, however; because of my background in I.T and the lack of I.T actually showing up most times, I am usually called upon for these services.

Well, this happened a few days ago. I arrived for work to see an employee who usually works at another building across town. I rarely see him so I was surprised that he was there. He is known for his lack of knowledge when it comes to techie anything.

So, he is sitting in the back room, where we have a system set up for anyone in the company to use if they decide to work back there for whatever reason. So, he is sitting there, tapping away at the keyboard, I notice he is on the web looking stuff up for research for an upcoming presentation he is giving. I sit down at the other end of the table, get out my laptop and start working. Well about 5 minutes goes by, he looks at me and says, “I think we have a major problem with this computer.” I ask him what the issue is. He explains, “Well, anything I am saving is not saving to my network drive, it is saving to Amanda’s network drive.” I look at him, and ask, “well did you sign in as you or….?? He says, “No, it was signed in already and shows Amanda’s name.” So, I tell him, Yes Steve, you have to log out of her profile since she forgot to log out and you have to log in as you.

He looks at me all confused and say’s, “That makes no sense to me, I am the one using the computer now, it should save stuff to my network drive.”

I explain that since it is still signed in under Amanda’s login, that is where anything saved will go to, and again tell him to log out and sign in under him.

He is still confused, but logs out of the current profile, logs in under him and tries it again. Well what do you know, it saves it to his network drive and now shows “his name.” I then again explain to him that in order to see his network drive when he uses the system he needs to log in as him. He states again that he does not understand why that is. He said all he knows is that it should know he is using the computer when he sits down to it. I did not explain anything further. I just grabbed my laptop and went to work somewhere else, wishing him a great day on the way out.",1259,0,1
Password restrictions are there for a reason.,"This was from last week. I'm new at my current job and a lot of the work is password resets. 

Back in March restrictions were increased on the AD (Active Directory) passwords because they were paltry before as you'll see later in this story. 

This story is about one of many a user that has avoided changing their password for months. 

Me: HelpDesk this is Absinthe speaking. 

User: My password reset and I can't change is for some reason. 

Me: How long is the password you're attempting to use? 

User: 8 digits. 

Me: I'm sorry but the password policy ""recently"" changed to 15 characters. 

User: 15 characters?! How are we supposed to remember something like that. 

Queue 5 minutes of walking the user through long password creation. 

We are now on the 7th try by the user to change their password. 

Me: You wouldn't happen to be using any words in your password, are you? The system recognizes almost any common word and they can't be used. 

User: there's no way the system recognizes the word I'm using. 

I spell out all of the requirements for the password such as no incrementing numbers, words, the need of a number or special character etc.

2 more failed attempts later. 

Me: please refrain from using any words. 

User: The system isn't going to recognize Yahweh!

Me:.... That's the 3rd most recognizable name for God. The system will catch that. 

User: Nuhhuh! My old password was Jesus123 and that worked. 

Me: this is why we changed the password policy, because we're dealing with PHI and those passwords worked before, but won't now. I know it's difficult, but it's better for our users and our client safety.

Queue 10 more minutes of the user attempting to change her password and swearing. 

Me: are you still trying to use 123 in your password?

User: you mean I can't do that either? How am I supposed to memorize this?  I'm gonna have to write this down now. 

Me: (dear Yahweh why, please no, that's worse than jesus123.) If that's what it takes, just know that that's a security risk and you've admitted to it on a recorded call.

User: -click- 


Some people just don't like security when it comes to other people's Medical information.



Edit: The comments turned into mostly about how the password policy is flawed. 

I will be bringing it up to my management. 

But then we're going through the Red tape of changing the passwords again. 

And then the process of changing 2000 passwords to the new policy because Security likes expiring everyone at once. 

The couple hundred that were missed were field reps who weren't connected at the time and AD failed to reset their credentials. 

The main point of this story was the dogged fighting of 

""Do this for your password policy."" 

""It's not working.""

""Made the same point"" 

""What that doesn't work?"" 

I will try to fix the password policy issues but the change won't come for at least a year or two. 

And that's after I fix the end user facing instruction issues, of which there are numerous.",110,0,1
Monday morning wake-up,"So I started as a Linux sysadmin in a research lab in April (during lockdown). I haven't met most of my colleagues in person, only via IM.

Rather naively, when I was looking up background, I saw the organisation was only 2 years old. Whilst this was technically right, the lab itself has history going back 40+ years, it's the overarching management organisation that's only 2 years old...

So with that in mind, you have 2 types of historic computing establishments - the ones where there is no documentation, management or clue, and everything is done by the seat of your pants, versus the much rarer ones where someone has gone to great lengths to lay down solid foundations with all the right tools, write processes and have everything managed, automated and controlled.

Turns out there's a middle-ground. Combine all the right tools and procedures with seat-of-your-pants day to day working and you have this place.

There is config management. There is automated deployment. There is extensive asset tracking. There are automated network scans. There is a wiki.

And none of it can be trusted because it's not been maintained. Most of the config profiles are broken or production machines are sandboxed, taking them out of central updates. Automated deployment takes longer than spinning up a machine by hand. Asset tracking is varying degrees of inaccurate. The wiki contains several pages written by me as I learned how to actually do things from conversations with colleagues.

I could go on and on with gripes about misuse of tooling, but the title refers to one specific incident that happened today. Last week, I was spinning up a new VM for the task I was given (it took literally an entire day). As part of this, I had to assign it a MAC address. There's a script on one of the management systems to generate valid MAC addresses for the VMWare cluster, yay.

Run it, and it immediately mentions HyperV. Turns out, there's a HyperV cluster too, and this script is a copy-paste job. It also prints out MAC addresses which are dash-separated rather than colon-separated, which VMWare's web UI doesn't like. Okay, annoying, but I can probably do something to help out here, can't I?

I opened up the script from `/usr/local/bin` \- it's Python. Great, I'm good with Python. Sure enough, it's using a library to represent MAC addresses, and there's a config option to switch the output format. Easy peasy. Oh wait, it's a managed machine (production at that) so let's do this the right way. I poked a colleague:

&gt;$me: ""So these scripts in `/usr/local/bin` on $MANAGEMENT\_SYSTEM, where are they deployed from? &lt;Explains formatting issue&gt;""  
&gt;  
&gt;$colleague: ""I'll just check -- these scripts SHOULD be put there by $CONFIG\_MANAGEMENT.""  
&gt;  
&gt;&lt;time passes&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;$colleague: ""Hmm, the scripts don't appear to come from $CM and weren't put there by an RPM. This is not good. Can you check with $admin?""

That doesn't bode well.

&gt;$me: ""So on $MANAGEMENT\_SYSTEM there's a collection of scripts in `/usr/local/bin`. however, when $colleague checked yesterday, they don't seem to be managed anywhere. any ideas?""  
&gt;  
&gt;$admin: ""Hmm, good question. I suspect they were hard-and-fast migrated (i.e. using rsync) from the previous server""

I check the dates. The files were created about 8 months ago, all at the same time. I leave it for the weekend and then we resume the conversation this morning.

&gt;$me: ""Right. What should we do about them?""  
&gt;  
&gt;$admin: ""I guess they should really be merged into $GIT\_REPO and packaged from there.""  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: ""Okay, I can do that.""

So I `scp` the files across from the live server into a working folder. Sure enough, there's several matches and all are modified, along with another dozen scripts that have been added since. The repo shows a last-commit date of several years ago. A lot of these scripts are doing things I don't really understand due to my newbie status. I try to discuss some of the changes with $admin prior to committing, but $admin has their own work to do. So, perhaps rather neglectfully, I do exactly as suggested, and ""do the standard git thing, fork it and open a PR.""

&gt;$admin: ""Well shit, some of those have hard coded passwords. There goes my day.""  
&gt;  
&gt;$me: &lt;checks one of the value-retrieval scripts&gt; ""and happen to log into $SQL\_DB as `root`.""  
&gt;  
&gt;$admin: ""fuck.  
and now they are on the internet""

Whoops.

So that prodded several teams into action, changing passwords and figuring out what the hell these scripts are doing. Of course, we're now expecting further scripts to break due to changed passwords, but on the bright side, it'll highlight those using `root` when they really shouldn't be.

Nothing like publishing your organisation's admin passwords for the whole world to see to light a fire under people into setting things up the right way, huh?

Side note: I deleted everything I created while the others did damage control. I probably should've gone through and sanitised them first, but I can't help marvel at how effective it was to get people to take things like drifting config seriously!",139,0,1
When was the last time you restarted your machine?,"I was working as an IT Team Lead at the time, so I didn't often take calls until they were escalated to me. On this day however we were overloaded so I got a taste of what tier 1 desktop support agents have to deal with on a day to day basis.  


Me: Standard Opening + How can I help you?

User: My calculator is not working.

(Now at this point since many of our users are engineers, I assume it is some sort of advanced calculator software he needs for whatever his job is.)

Me: What is the name of the software you're having issues with?

User: Uh... Calculator? 

Me: Do you mean like Windows Calculator, the small one that comes on every computer?

User: Yes. It won't work. It opens slowly, but won't do calculations.

(Great, this guy's computer is so messed up that the most simple program imaginable isn't even working)

Me: Okay, I understand. When was the last time you restarted your machine? It may have some updates to perform.

User: \*under his breath\* ...winter of last year was how many months ago... \*then at normal volume\* I'm not sure, maybe 9-10 months ago?

Me: Wow, okay. If you don't mind go ahead and restart your computer for me.

User: Sure.

\*\*A few minutes later\*\*

Me: How are we lookin'?

User: My screen still says 'Windows Update: 1%'

Me: In that case, I'm going to give you your ticket number and you can call us back if the problem persists after your machine comes back online. Also, for the future I'd recommend restarting your computer more often.

(I checked back on that ticket every once in awhile, and we never heard from him again. Problem solved.)  
TL:DR, Please people do not wait 9 months to restart your computers.",1532,0,1
"Out of scope, out of mind","In 1995 I took my first job with an IT consulting company.  I'd had non-IT jobs and done IT consulting on my own before that.  Having someone else negotiate with the customer was a big change.  This is the story of one of my first times being sent onsite, to perform a specific task.

The customer had a new wall mount 19"" rack installed in their file room with a patch panel and twisted pair run to all of their workstation locations.  I was sent there to install a new Ethernet hub in the rack and connect it to their existing 10base2 thinnet.  In order to install a new device on a thinnet, you have to take down the entire network while you disconnect the coax and install a new T-connector.  With planning, the outage can often be limited to a few seconds, but in-progress transfers will often fail, so best practice is to arrange a downtime window.

Directly under their new rack was a DOS computer, monitor, printer, and keyboard.   That is where I would be extending the thinnet from to connect the new hub.  Shortly after I got there I had to get out of the way briefly so the office manager could start a batch file on that computer.  She hung around to watch it while I got back to work.  I talked to her while I worked, and she explained why they were upgrading their network.

They had a NetWare server on the other side of the file room that held their database.  The PC under the rack was the only one that could print.   Every time they needed to print a report, all their users had to log out of the database.  Printing a report took about a half-hour.  It used to be much faster, but had gotten progressively slower over the years.   They were paying their software vendor an ungodly sum to replace the NetWare server with a Sun pizza box that could print reports in just a couple minutes.  My downtime window would start when the printer finished.  Once I had the network back up she would start another report.

I glanced at the monitor occasionally as I worked and noticed that all it showed was files being copied.  I finished before it had started printing, so she took me to the next room over to show off their new pizza box.  When we got back the computer was still copying files, and continued to do so while we stared at it, until the printer finally started.  Only a couple pages came out.  I then extended the thinnet, connected the hub, and confirmed the network was working.   Having completed the work I had been sent there for, this is the point at which I probably should have left.  Instead, I asked her if I could take a look at the batch file she used for printing before she started the next report.  Keep in mind that at all my previous customers I was the one to decide my scope of work, in consultation with the customer.   She said that was fine because she had to queue up the report on her workstation anyway.

I had a hunch about the batch file, and was proved correct.  I'd seen this problem before.  People that were not familiar with NetWare writing batch files to run on NetWare servers.   Normally when you want to copy a file from a DOS batch file you use the ""copy"" command.  This works fine for stand-alone computers.  Data is pulled off the hard drive, into memory, then written back to the hard drive.  This does not work so well with networked computers.  In this case the file will be loaded from the server's hard drive into the server's memory, sent over the (10mbps half-duplex) network to the workstation, which will send it back to the server, to write back to the server's hard drive in a new location.  When copying files on a NetWare server you should always use the ""ncopy"" command.  This command tells the server to copy the file.  The server loads the file from its hard drive into memory, and then writes it directly back to its hard drive, without sending it over the network.

It looked like the batch file made a backup of the database before it printed the report.  It took me less than a minute to add an ""n"" before all the copy commands.  I waited for her to get back, then she ran the batch file.  It took a couple minutes to print the report.  She at first thought I broke it, but I watched it run and the ncopys looked like they worked fine, and she reviewed the report and confirmed it looked correct.  I left and didn't even think to mention the extra 10 minutes I spent there to my boss.  Never heard a word about it or went there again.

TL;DR: Customer spent an ungodly sum to replace their old server to print a lot faster.  I spent a couple minutes making a software change that accomplished the same thing on their old server, for free, shortly before it was decommissioned.",205,0,1
FBI fax LOCKDOWN!,"After my ""black magic fax"" post the other day I got thinking about some of the other more interesting jobs I had as a repair tech. Tried posting this a few days ago but bumped the X button and lost an hour of typing. For the love of user frustration reddit, add a save draft feature. Anyway here I go again.


Our company got a call from a small FBI field office about 40 minutes from our store. They needed a tech to fix a Panasonic fax machine that had jammed up and they couldn't get it working. They said the reason they were using us is because we were an authorized dealer and it would be faster then getting one of their techs with clearance on site. I got picked since I was still one of the newer techs and I was probably the most qualified Panasonic tech other then the 2 lead techs. Everyone else was either more network/pc focused.

I called their office and got all the info I could on the error/state of the machine, as well as recieved intructions on where to go &amp; who to talk to on arrival. They also sent over a form I needed to fill out and return so I they could process a background check on me and get me temporary clearance.

I was honestly a little weirded out by the background check but figured I was standard protocol since it was an FBI office.

Cut to 2 days later, I grabbed everything I could think of part wise to try and make sure this would be a onetime trip, loaded up the car and headed out. Upon arrival it was a standard looking business building with it's own parking garage. I grabbed my tool bag and paperwork portfolio and headed in, got off the elevator and went to the only labeled door on that floor, rang the bell and got buzzed in. I was buzzed into a small waiting area where my tool bag and portfolio were searched then a gentleman came out and said he'd be my escort to the machine.

*OK Feeling a bit more nervous now*

I'm shown into a small room with a small table and chair, one door controlled with a keypad, no windows, and 2 cameras up in opposite corners. No machine, just the table and chair, I looked at my escort with a *wtf face*. He said have a seat and the machine will be brought to me.

*OK...*

Started unpacking my tools and grabbing the usual suspects for teardown. About 2 minutes later the machine is rolled in on a mail trolley and placed on the table.


Escort: Ok, here you go. If you need anything else just ask the guard. I'll be back if you need me.

*wait guard? WTF!*

He darted out of the room before I could say anything and in steps a MIB agent minus the shades. He says nothing and just stands there.

Me: Guess I'll get started

Guard: . . .

I powered on the machine, after its standard boot up I'm greeted with the tell tale grinding sound of broken plastic and an error indicator for jam in the fuser. Yay... I started opening all the doors and looking inside to see what was stuck where. Saw the trail edge of paper stuck in the fuser. Popped open the back cover and no paper was on the other side of the fuser. Sadly I knew exactly what this meant. This particular model had a tech bulletin regarding the fuser drive gear breaking and causing paper to either accordion in the fuser or wrap around the hot roller. Added fun fact was this model also needed to be completely ripped apart to get to the fuser. Luckily I had a replacement gear in my tool bag.

Me: Pretty sure I know what the issue is but it's going to take about 3 hours to fix just so your aware.

Guard: *head nod*

*DUDE! SPEAK! FFS!*

I start ripping off all the covers, pulled the doc feeder off, scanner housing, and finally part of the frame till... Fuser access at last! I removed the mounting screws and pulled the fuser in two, *angelic tone* the lone jam and gear pieces in site. As I go to grab the jam I get.

Guard: SIR!

*JESUS CHRIST MAN!*

He scared the crap out of me so bad I accidentally threw my screwdriver over my shoulder.

Me: Yes?

Guard: I'll take that

He reached over pulled out the paper and then stepped out for about 30 seconds then popped back in.

Guard: Ok, you may proceed.

Me: . . . Ok

I replaced the gear, cleaned out the busted plastic, and proceeded to put this pain in the ass back together. Got everything reassembled and it was time to power back up.

*Side note:* I hate full machine teardowns mainly for the large amount of connections and ribbon cables you have to fight with. One to many things to go wrong if you're not careful.

Plugged in the machine and after boot up it was looking for paper to print the fax still in memory. *Whew* No errors or god awful noises, should be good to go.

Me: Ok, everything looks good. Um, I need some paper to test it. It's still trying to print the last fax recieved.

Guard: One moment

He steps out and back in along with the escort. They pull the machine towards them and add the paper. The machine does its thing and prints out about a 14 page document. The guard takes it and leaves.

Escort: Ok, looks like that's that anything else.

Me: yeah I still need to make sure everything is working correctly. I just need to make a few test copies to test the doc feeder and scanner. What was all that about? If I may ask.

Escort: Classified doc, sorry.

EDIT: A user pointed out that they do not fax classified documents. This happened around 2003-2004 so I'm going from memory. He most likely said confidential and in my brain that meant classified.

Me: Kind of thought so, you could of warned me. He scared the crap out of me when I went to un-jam the machine.

Escort: Oh, sorry. Didn't he say anything.

Me: No, not really... it's fine.

I finish my tests, pack up my tools, and start filling out my paperwork. As I'm doing that I start turning the machine so I can get the serial number for my paperwork.

Escort: What are you doing?

Me: I'm getting the serial number. The company keeps track of model and serial numbers to keep track of call backs and repeat issues.

Escort: Actually... you can't have that. We'll keep an internal log incase we need to call you back. If your boss has an issue have him call over and we'll explain.

Me: Ok. Sign here please.

I'm escorted back out, tool bag and portfolio rechecked, got to my car, called the boss to update, took lunch and just zoned out to the wtf was all that. That was definitely one of the strangest more stressful moments I had on that job.

A lot of folks are saying that was standard protocol and I dont disagree. It's just as a civilian your not expecting things to play out like a mission impossible scene, it was just surreal.",2068,0,1
The sprinkler system malfunctioned. Can you fix our machine?,"Short but amusing one this round.

The court house in our county was getting some renovations and upgrades to the various offices there in. About 2 weeks after some of the floors opened up we got a call saying there had been a sprinkler system malfunction and they needed us to check their copier.

I showed up and immediately said NOPE the second I saw the machine. The copier was COVERED in black crap and reaked. Incase you didn't know, sprinkler systems are not nice and clean like they're shown in the movies, they have all kinds of crap sitting in the pipes from years of sitting there and stink to high heaven from stagnant water. The whole office was covered with black sludge and just smelled like toilet water.

The office IT guys got super lucky since most of the systems were under desks or hutches so they were either completely safe or had a little bit of water hit them, also they were on good surge protectors so none of them got fried. The monitors and keyboards were scrap at this point. 

They asked if I could fix the copier and if not they needed a full report on what it would cost to repair to submit to their insurance. I immediately said fixing it now is out of the question since this thing was out in the open and basically had went through a down pour. I started trying to see if anything was salvageable and tried to get an itemized list of what all it would need. I lifted the doc feeder to find about an inch of water inside the optics (scanner) section, opened the main doors and the inside was completely covered with black sludge. This thing was not on a surge protector because reasons? I take about 15 minutes to look at this thing and tell them we'll send over a repair estimate.

Talked to the boss about what all I should put on the list and he said just make a list of every board and main section in the machine, get prices and I'll send the insurance a cost to repair vs cost to replace. Insurance will always go the cheap route and replacement was definitely going to be cheaper.

Eventually we get the go ahead to replace. Was a good upgrade for them too since the replacement boards bought individually are a fortune and that drove the repair price through the roof. Also made sure there was a surge protector on the new one.

No idea why replacement boards are so expensive. You can literally buy a working used machine (same model) for cheaper then replacing the main boards like 90% of the time.",285,0,1

K: BUT YOU'RE IT, THATS WHY I RANG YOU. AND 
NOW YOU TELL ME YOU CANT HELP!

N: Wait, did you ring me because the power was out, or to fix the internet?

K: BOTH!

N: (At this point I'd run out of energy to question further) Okay Karen I'm going to put you through to your internal property department, have a nice day.
*click*

Then I proceed to go into the bathroom and cry for 40 solid minutes.

I was nosey so I asked someone a bit nicer at the site why the power was out. They said one of their drivers drove straight into the power box. I don't know what it is with these drivers, do they specifically aim at the power boxes? Because this happens at least once a week with this customer.



Anyway I hope my first post humoured you, lmk if theres any improvements I can make in future stories :)",2164,0,1
It's not really an emergency...,"Here in Australia, we call 000 for emergencies. This will be important later.

This was 1996-ish; we had the web, just, home internet was pre-56k dialup, and corporate offices were connected with ISDN &amp; Sprint. Our office had a PBX system where you dialled 0 to get a line out, then dialled the number you want.

Our regional operation absorbed the Hong Kong office and we had to hook them into our systems.  The HK office however, didn't have ISDN; we had to use a dial up modem. So I set up our email system to dial the HK office once an hour to collect email. 0 to get a line out, 0015 to prefix an international call, 852 for HK, etc. etc.

This was 25 years ago now so I can't remember how I fucked up, but I remember very well the stern expression on the face of our office facilities manager as she approached my desk on Monday morning. *""Ratsta, I don't appreciate being called by the police at 10pm on a Friday night...""*

It turns out that the modem was connected to a directly-connected outside line, and not a PABX line. So my dial string of 0-0015-etc. was going straight through to emergency services. It would try 3 or 5 times then give up until the next hourly task would kick off!",347,0,1
"The Tale of the SSO, that was really a database, that was really a script","Hello, and welcome. I’m back with a story, this time, involving a single-sign-on application that crashed, or so I was told.

This story starts with our valiant multi-role specialist, **$Space**, happily asleep and dreaming of greener pastures. Or really, pastures that look strangely like the inside of a gym, hanging 20 feet up off a wall by their fingertips.

The phone goes off.

&gt; $Space

No reply, there are snores about.

&gt; Our single sign-on is down

Currently, they are trying to figure out how to climb down from a wall in their dreams.

Another notification appears. This time, from a different user.

&gt; $Space, our website is down

Our technologist continues to slumber.

Eventually, he awakes, after having climbed sixty or so feet horizontally, rather than the twenty feet to the floor. Why? Nobody knows.

He checks his notifications. Sees that the single sign-on is down. Or so he was told.

&gt; Hmm, that’s weird. It’s been rock solid ever since I fixed the database bug.

The single sign on application is custom-built, but has been extremely robust and fast, or so our engineer thinks. The truth lies somewhere left of field.

Our engineer checks the single sign on. It offers up the proper page when he opens it on his phone.

&gt; That can’t be the issue.

He slowly catches up on his messages, not entirely sure about what was down. He checks the status of the main user portal that supports a couple thousand members. That seemed to be online as well. He then opens up the cloud dashboard, and sees all the servers are online, except for one he crashed the night before.

&gt; I should fix that.

Everything looks normal. He asks $WebsiteDeveloper, who built the user portal, what happened.

&gt; $Space: What happened this morning?

$WebsiteDeveloper is an intelligent engineer who has built this entire application from scratch. So, it is safe to say, they are a very competent person.

&gt; $WebsiteDeveloper: It looked like our site was running off a database change from April that only just got deployed. I think it crashed the site, so I reverted it.

This database change was made to allow all the sites to access the database through the local network, rather than hopping through two firewalls to access each other - no more access rules needed to be in place. In fact, the old setup no longer functioned at all, as the firewall rules that allowed such access had been removed. Reverting this change would be a Very Bad Thing.

&gt; $Space: Hold on a second, let me check something

He checks the software. The website has been using the new database since April, and it was not just deployed, as he was told.

&gt; $Space: I hate to say it, but we’ve been running on the new database for about three months now

&gt; $WebsiteDeveloper: Yeah, I thought it was that, but it was actually the deploy script.

The deploy script is used by our applications to automatically start themselves when they are spun up on a new machine. This script has not been changed for at least six months.

&gt; $WebsiteDeveloper: It seemed to not migrate the database properly. So I updated the script, and it all works now.

&gt; $Space, internally: _Gee, thanks for telling me that I didn’t need to panic_

&gt; $Space: Cool. So everything is set?

&gt; $WebsiteDeveloper: Yup. Everything is online.

&gt; $Space: When do you think we can move to the new version of the user portal?

&gt; $WebsiteDeveloper: $Testers have been finding some bugs, and $ProjectManager still isn’t happy that we don’t have that search API. When do you think you can have it available?

&gt; $Space: I guess I have to get that started, don’t I?

And thus, our tale is complete. Everything ended up fine, and our valiant engineer was not needed to fix anything major. Only the server that they crashed the previous evening.

**TL:DR**: The SSO was down. Except it wasn’t, the database was actually down. Except it wasn’t, the deploy script was broken.",151,0,1
"The Tale of a Non-Standard VoIP Infrastructure, or IP phones still confuse me"," Greetings TFTS! I think this is my second post here. This story takes place during my internship last summer. It was written after my internship was over but I forgot about it until now.  I'm still learning, so there may be some mistakes in what I say. Please feel free to correct me or offer your thoughts on the root cause of the issue.

Anyway, let's get to the story.

It’s a normal day halfway through my summer internship working at the main office of a global waste services company($Company). $Company grew rapidly in the late 90s and early 2000s through a series of large acquisitions and no one thought about consolidating any of the 500-odd pieces of software used throughout the acquired companies or about standardizing our network. As a network engineering intern, I was working with the network team on their yearlong network standardization project. 

I had a site to do that fateful day. As a diligent intern, I always checked up on the current setup at each site before the activation. Months before, $Company decided to stop doing site surveys before each activation so, like the proverbial box of chocolates, I never knew what I was gonna get. 

This site had 3 switches listed in our monitoring service, 2 3600 series and one SF300 small business switch. Per my usual routine, I ssh into each switch to copy the old running config in case we needed to back out of the change. I copy the configs of the 3600’s no problem but when I try to ssh into the SF30… no dice. I try all of our username/password combinations after trying tacacs and even find some old usernames/passwords from coworkers and still no luck. I knew nothing about this switch series so I decided to ask my good friend Google.

It turns out this small business series, (now the SG300 which I encounter in a later story) is meant to be “user-friendly” in that you can manage it with a web interface. I try the interface, but Teamviewer is stealing traffic on port 80. That rules out changing the config of that switch, so at this point I figure we can just get rid of it. There are a ton of unused ports on the core switch and I check a few times throughout the week to make sure they remain unused.

We finally get to the day of the activation. It’s a conference call with me, a remote tech from our MSP, and a tech contracted by our MSP to be onsite (This particular site was about 300 miles away). The MSP tech configures their new fangled SDWAN device and then I get to reconfiguring the LAN.

I have no issues. We configure both switches and I have the onsite tech move any cables on the SF300 switch to the core switch. We do user testing at the site and everything is good. People sign things confirming the change is okay and we begin the strange and awkward process of saying goodbye to people on a conference call.

The next day:

I come into the office to an email for our site contact. There are seven phones that are powered but can’t call and one that is completely dead. It just so happens that I moved 8 cables from the SF300 to the core switch. What a coincidence.

I look over the new configs I put on the switches and I see no issues, so I take a look at the old configs. There were two vlans configured on the switches: vlan1 and vlan2, for data and voice respectively. The IP for the data vlan, per our standard, remained the same but most of our switches had only have one vlan configured. We add a voice vlan (among others) when we reconfigure switches at all the sites. 

Well, the old voice vlan was a 192.168.0.0/24 subnet and the new one is a 10.0.0.0/24 subnet. This is a problem, but I realize that it’s only these 8 phones that don’t work. 

I ask the site contact to send some pictures of the network room and make some interesting discoveries (that could have been found with a site survey). There is a 48-port unmanaged Netgear switch and a the phones are running off an old IP-PBX from a company that was likely contracted to install phones without approval from our telephony team. The PBX is connected to the Netgear switch which is then connected to the core switch. Here’s a fun little diagram: \[PBX\]---\[Netgear\]---\[3600\]. There’s a nice sticker on the PBX with a 192.168.0.1 address on it. Interesting…

At this point, I am in way over my head and this issue may be related to networking, but I’m breaching telephony territory at this point, so I ask some coworkers on the network and telephony teams. They’re as confused as I am. The telephony guys recommend putting in a request to replace the entire phone system (which we did but the company is having money troubles so anything like this requires senior executive approval).

In the meantime, we bounce around some ideas on how to make sure the phones can reach the PBX to make calls. All the phones that are broken are on the second floor connected to the IDF switch, so maybe it’s a routing issue. 

We decided to get in touch with the site contact again but we can’t reach them for a few days via email, IM or phone. The contact finally decides to email us back and happily mentions that the phones are working normally as of a few days. Great, thanks for the notice. I’m glad I didn’t spend more time trying to solve the issue in the interim (sarcasm).

Now all the phones are working except the dead one. I email our contracting company to send a tech out to patch the phone back into the switch. The morning the tech is out there, I get a call on my way to work (keep in mind I’m one time zone behind). Surprise! It’s the tech we sent out to the site. He patched the phone back in, but it’s not pulling an IP. 

I remember seeing in the old running config that the port connecting the core switch and the unmanaged Netgear had a description of “Uplink to Netgear phone switch.” I tell the tech to plug the phone into the Netgear switch and Bam! It’s got an Ip and can make calls.

I tell my team about this interesting revelation, that the 192.168 subnet is still active our network. We have no idea how the rest of the IP phones are communicating with the PBX.  We also realize that, should a phone restart and lose its previous config, it would probably stop working altogether. We start pushing harder for the site upgrade, which is probably going to be 16k or so.

At this point, the issue of out of my hands so I forget about it. But lo! A text on my personal number (which I gave out for the contact to send pictures of the site) that a phone just stopped working after (you guessed it) it restarted. Still, I can’t do much about it now. The request is pending approval from senior execs and it’s not even in my team anymore. Plus, this happens on my second-to-last day, so I don’t want to add this to any last-minute tasks. 

In the end, I left before exec approval on the request. My coworkers took me out for a nice dinner on my last day and overall it was a rewarding experience. I’ve been offered the same position next summer so I hope then I can find out what happened then. 

TL;DR - Network upgrade (and some poor judgement on my part) causes phones to stop working and we could have planned for this if the company continued surveying each site before each upgrade.

P.S.

Since last summer, the company cancelled the internship program due to COVID, and no one else is really hiring interns :(",46,0,1
"Phone is ""Out of Service""","This is a fault call I got sent to this week.

Customer reported that one of their IP phones was out of service since they returned to work post lockdown. I'm assuming that our 1st Line support guys couldn't resolve it and this is why it was passed to me, a field engineer. I called the customer to try and see if there was any chance I could resolve the fault remotely first before going to site. One of the first things I asked was if the phone was completely dead or if anything was being displayed on the screen? The customer told me that it was displaying ""out of service"" on the screen. Based on this info I advised them that I would indeed need to come to their site to investigate further.

On arrival I was taken to the faulty phone and immediately could see that it was, in fact, dead. Luckily the network cabinet that the phone was patched back to was located in the same room just a few feet away. Turns out that the switch was dead too. Now, the company I work for only looks after this customer's phone system and they have another vendor that is responsible for their network equipment. So I shouldn't really do anything further as the fault is technically not our responsibility. This phone was also the only thing patched to the switch. There was no external explanation for the power to be down to the switch as the power bar was lit up and the kettle lead to the switch was connected. I tried the power button on the switch and nothing happened. I thought the switch itself might be faulty but tried one last thing. I Unplugged the switch and plugged it back in again and for some reason it now booted up successfully. Of course the phone then booted up as well and connected to the server. 

A simple fix in the end but just goes to show why you can't always trust what the customer tells you. By rights I could have palmed it off and told them to contact their network support to look at the switch but I know they are based somewhere that would require them to fly someone over as they don't have any engineers based where we are.",150,0,1
"Oh, Nancy...","Hello friends, second-time poster here. This happened moments ago and I have to share it with somebody. 

I do database/server administration for a relatively large application. My job description is a little fuzzy so people (developers, testers, end users...) tend to ask me for help when they hit a wall and they're just not sure who else to ask. 

I get an email this morning from a middle-manager, we'll call him Kyle, that one of his users is having trouble logging in. When users log in, they put in their username and password, then it takes them to a second page where they put in a security code, either from an MFA authenticator app if they have that set up, or else they click a link and get the code in their email. Apparently this lady, we'll call her Nancy, is not receiving the email. Kyle says he has been manually overriding the security code so that she's been able to get logged in and work. 

First of all I do a double take, because I didn't realize that was something he was able to do and it's more than a little concerning. But I put that on the mental backburner and start looking at this security code issue. Nancy's account looks okay, it's only a week old, and it has an email address associated to it. I check the email logs and... there are no emails to her address. So it's not that the emails with the codes aren't sending, they aren't even getting generated and queued. Next I check the security code logs, sure enough, there are no entries associated with her account. 

Now I start to get the creeping sense of dread that I know exactly what the problem is. See, I don't like to assume that when a user has an issue, it's because they're doing something wrong. I feel like that makes people feel dumb, and that's the easiest way to get on their bad side. It doesn't help that I'm going through middle-management, because in addition to offending the user I run the risk of offending him for overlooking something simple. So I look through some more logs, I dig through the code for the login page, I try it myself and check the result... I don't want to believe it's something so obvious, but the only conclusion I can come up with is that Nancy just isn't actually clicking the link to generate a security code at all.

So I type out an email as carefully and diplomatically as I can explaining this. I hit send and then I don't get much work done for the next 20 minutes while I anxiously await an angry response. Kyle responds: ""This was indeed the issue. Apologies for not catching that myself.""

I sigh with relief, then laugh out loud. Sometimes users can be dumb, but at least some of them are nice about it.


Update: So apparently what he did was not actually override it, but he got Nancy to give him her one-time-password key, which he put into his authenticator app to get a code, and whenever she needed to log in he would just email her the code. Definitely a *facepalm* ""don't do that"" moment, but at least he doesn't have elevated permissions by accident or something",1537,0,1

Inventory leads to theft reveal,"It was requested that this comment be expanded upon into its own post, so here it is in all of my terrible writing ability.    

I'm not an IT professional and this whole event took place more than a decade ago, it was attempted to be recreated as best as myself and one of the other parties could while still maintaining anonymity.

The company I was working for at the time was looking at selling, before that can happen a full inventory had to be done.  One of the IT managers, Jimmy for purposes of this story, was given the responsibility of checking all of the equipment we had in our various offices storage rooms making sure that everything was accounted for and in working order.

During the inventory Jimmy began to notice that over the last year quite a bit of our equipment was being damaged out but that nobody was signing the forms. Being properly concerned over this he went to our CTO Don with explaining that either someone was either lazy, or perhaps as a worst case stealing the equipment and reselling it. Allaying his fears Don told him he would get with the corporate security team and check the logs to see what was going on.

Fast forward a couple months and all the general managers and heads of teams are flown into the main office for our end of year meeting and Christmas party. Mike, the corporate sec team lead from my office, and I are hanging out down at the open bar making our appearance before we are allowed to leave when Jimmy comes over and asks Mike if he knows what happened to all of this missing equipment. Mike of course has absolutely no idea whats going on and tells Jimmy to email him all the information he has and he will look into it when we get back to our office.

Mike hits me up about a week later and shows me this list of missing equipment and the stuff that just came from our office. Mike says hes already gone and checked the things issued to our people and that anyone who had one of the missing laptops was given a significantly older model. It was also during this check that he noticed some of our equipment was straight up missing like a whole server and its rack that had been supposedly shipped to us from the main office right before we went to the party.

Mike got with Jimmy and had him check the main office storage area where he found the missing server. Mike reached out to his boss about what was going on and grabbed a plane heading to the main office where he got with Jimmy and installed a GPS tracker that we usually used for our fleet vehicles as well as some cameras both in the hallway to the storage area and focused directly on the rack. About a week later the rack was gone and Jimmy sent over the video file to Mike and his boss where it showed our CTO Don grabbing the equipment and loading it into a local delivery company.

Jimmy checks for paperwork and all it shows is that that server had still been delivered to our office, of course none of this is evidence that Don was stealing from our company and not just shitty paperwork so Mikes boss sends a couple guys down to Jimmy and has him check the tracker. Tracker shows it at a business not too far away. Mikes boss contacts the legal team and police and a happy little group of people all meet outside the business in question. Investigation ensues and the police determine that our CTO had been taking newer model laptops, some Monitors, and various other equipment. He would fix it up at home and sell it to his buddy  who was using it to build out his business that just happened to compete with ours.

End of the day Don got fired and arrested, I wasn't able to find any info on the sentencing but as far as I know he got out after a couple years as it was non violent.

Jimmy got a promotion and Mike got a nice little bonus that quarter.  Not that it mattered, not much after the end of the quarter the sale of the business went through and everybody but Mike lost their job.",1366,0,1
Why is it like this?,"Tl;dr: Customer refuses to contact anyone before performing a data destructive maneuver they are unfamiliar with, doesn't read the warning, and then shockedpikachumeme.jpeg when something goes wrong.


So, for background, I work for the third largest PC manufacturer (you know, the one that told you what brand you were getting), now as server support. 


I've posted here a couple times, nothing frequent, but I just had what I feel is the biggest rookie mistake that could cost someone their job come across my desk.


So the call comes in from triage, and the agent explains to me that they're having issues adding two new drives to their RAID array. Cool, checks out, bring the customer over.


The customer then proceeds to explain to me that they bought two new drives to expand their storage, and they wanted to turn these two drives into a RAID1 to complement the existing storage pool on the RAID10, but that they had tried to do this using the [initial setup software], which, as anyone who's used our hardware to set up a RAID knows....is a bad idea, because it just blows off whatever VD is there, and recreates what you told it to.


So I explained this to the customer, and he goes, ""Fuck! Why is it like that?!"" I then explained to him that the [initial setup software] is only for initial system deployments or decommissioning, and any other RAID restructures need to be done with our LOM software, or in another piece of software depending on what you want to do. [I didn't tell him that he missed the part of the [initial setup software] where it tells you it's data destructive].


So I got him calmed down, confirmed he had backups, and explained that the only thing I could do is recreate the RAID10 that he blew off, and create a RAID1 for the additional drives that he had purchased (the RAID10 had SAS drives, the RAID1 was SATA, and his controller wouldn't let you combine across interfaces). He was cool with this, and I explained to him that once we do that, the only thing he needs to do is restore his data.


So we get that done, and he tries to get the data restored, and can't do it. He has to call Datto and have them remote in and restore his data for him, because he has no idea how to do it himself.


Yes, I get that mistakes happen, I get that he might have been new, and I get that he only lost an hour's worth of data, but that's the kind of hot dogging that will cost you and or your company hours or days of downtime, if not a metric ass-load of money to go along with it.",423,0,1
"""It's Company Policy"" ie how to get paid for doing nothing","I'd been in a contract role doing IT Support at a company for almost two years. Got on with everyone, did the job well, never any issues with the boss or colleagues. Great job, only 15 minutes from home and the pay was pretty good.

I'd spent most of my last few weeks working on a schedule of upgrades to our email system, had booked in all users for hour-long appointments to upgrade their machines during the coming month, and was generally as busy as a normal IT department would be. No slacking off.

Got pulled in to HR on 1st December at 10:00am, told that my contract wouldn't be renewed after 31st December and I now had 15 minutes to clear my desk and leave. They would however continue to pay me until 31st December, as per my contract. Why wouldn't they let me stay and work until then, tie up all the loose ends and carry out all the upgrades I'd scheduled with people? ""Company Policy"".

I was shell shocked as to why they couldn't trust me, and quietly returned to my desk, deleted a couple of personal files from my computer, gathered my stuff and managed to mumble ""seeya"" to my three colleagues who were equally as shocked.

My boss escorted me out of the building, and at the door I said ""I'd like to say it's been nice working here... but I can't right now"" and stormed out, seething as there had been lots of people there I would have liked to say a proper goodbye to, have Christmas drinks with, etc. Plus I realised I had left my favourite mug behind and dammit, I loved that mug, but there was no way I could go back in now.

What upset me most was the feeling that people would have been talking about me as in ""OMG 40somethingcommuter must have been doing something bad to get escorted out"".

Within five days of job hunting I had a new job starting on 3rd January! Spent all of December relaxing, not having to slog to work through snow &amp; ice and bad weather, and being able to see friends and family over Christmas without call-outs or weekend working.

They replaced my contract role with a permanent role. I suggested to a friend of mine that I'd worked with before, that he should apply. He got the job. Joke was on them - I knew this guy was lazy, took multiple long breaks whenever he could and wasn't really very good at his job. He stayed with them about three (incompetent) years! Did him a favour as he needed a job, screwed them over as I knew he would be rubbish :-)",2636,0,1
How Do You Plug In Headphones?,"I wish I was making this one up.

I'm a Senior Network Engineer in a school. Currently we are running a number of classes online via Microsoft Teams.

Today I was sitting in my office, when a member of staff poked their head in and informed me that they had a Teams call scheduled later in the day. They weren't a teacher so they wouldn't be running it, but instead providing support.

As they had never used Teams before, I showed them how it worked and told them they just needed to click the Join Meeting button when they were ready.

I (foolishly) believed that was the last that I would see of them.

5 minutes later.

User: ""Does the office desktop have speakers built in?""

Me: ""No it doesn't, but in the drawer next to it are a set of headphones with a microphone built in. Just plug them in and it'll all work.""

2 minutes later.

User: ""How do I connect the headphones?""

Now at first I think that maybe they're talking about default audio devices. The headphones are plugged in but not working or connecting to Teams.

So I go to the office, explaining how to change the default device as I go. When I get there, the headphones are on the desk, unplugged.

User: ""See, they aren't connected.""

I'm going to ignore the fact that they let me go through the whole explanation about default devices, without telling me that's not what they were asking about. If they're not familiar with technology I can understand that being a bit confusing.

What I'm not going to ignore is the headphones unplugged on the desk.

Me: ""So you can't... Connect them...?""

User: ""Yes. How do I plug them in?""

Me: ""You put the end of the lead in the headphone slot.""

User: ""...""

Me: ""The hole in the front of the computer.""

User: ""Huh?""

Me: ""The green circle.""

User: ""...""

Me: ""Next to the USB port.""

User: ""...""

Me: ""Do you see the little drawing of the headphones?"" - Points- ""This one here.""

User: ""Oh okay!""

Following Instructions is hard,"Got a call this morning.  A user (a lawyer in the legal department) need to install email software onto his personal phone to get his company email.

He didn't have the directions (FYI, our old email app was being phased out and today was the last day to install the new app).  I sent him the directions.  He thanked me and ended the call.  He calls back.  He says he is not getting the QR code to scan into the app to install the company info into the app.  I ask him about step 1 of the directions which has him log into a website on his PC to generate the QR code.  He said he could not sign in.  I remotely access his PC and watch him try to sign into a picture of the login page included in the instructions I sent him.  I click the link above the picture and he was able to sign in.  The next step was to click a link within the web page to access the page that would actually generate the QR code.  He again clicked on the picture of the link on the instructions.  We eventually got the QR code generated to scan into the email app on his phone.

A retirement bonus with a catch.,"Another recent TFTS post reminded me of this gem. 

Back when I was in college, I had a job as a part-time PC tech for a rather large regional IT contractor in the SF Bay Area. One of our bigger contracted clients was a large medical nonprofit, ""MedGroupCo"", that we maintained with a bi-weekly maintenance contract. Every two weeks or so, we'd send a handful of techs out to do a quick sweep for problems, tune-up their printers, and perform rotating scheduled maintenance on some of their leased PC's and networking equipment. They had more than 600 computers spread across several medical campuses, along with dozens of shared laser printers and associated network closets. We had a solid maintenance plan in place to keep up with everything and they'd been a happy client for many, many years. 

One day, out of the blue, MedGroupCo's CTO ""Tom"" called us up and asked to renegotiate the contract. The medical group was having financial problems and had just gutted his IT budget...he couldn't afford us any longer. After a long sit-down with our sales and support people, we placed the client into a new and cheaper contract. Rather than visit every two weeks, we'd shift them onto a semiannual maintenance plan. We'd come out twice a year to do regular maintenance, and all other calls would be handled on an on-demand basis. Equipment failures would be covered under the lease warranties, but anything beyond that would involve a per-call support charge. The maintenance visits would be more disruptive and require a larger number of techs, but the overall contract cost was substantially lower. ""Six figures annually"" lower. We warned them that moving to an on-demand based support model would be a bit of an adjustment. Because we'd been visiting every two weeks, the client had never used our ticketing system before. Their employees usually just jotted their computer issues down on a piece of paper and taped them to the sides of their monitors, knowing that we'd be by within a couple of weeks to get them fixed. We emphasized to the client that this might be an employee training issue, but the CTO insisted that he could get his users trained to use the new ticketing system and that it wouldn't be a problem. 

Fast forward five months. 

Our department manager had started to plan the first of MedGroupCo's semiannual maintenance visits and opened their ticket history to see whether they'd been having any recurring issues that might need special attention. Nada. And by ""nada"", I don't mean ""No recurring issues"". I mean no issues at all. The company hadn't filed a single ticket. That was...unlikely. At a minimum, they should have statistically had at least a half-dozen PC crashes during that period, and their printers should have required some maintenance. In hindsight, the manager later admitted that we should have followed up with the company sooner after the contract switch, but we had a LOT of clients and support was spread across several teams, so nobody had noticed that one of our biggest clients hadn't logged a single ticket. Because MedGroupCo hadn't logged any complaints, there was a general assumption that the client was submitting tickets and that they were being handled by one of the other teams. 

Our department manager, worried about the discovery, called up their CTO's office and asked for Tom. He was even more worried when the receptionist responded with, ""I'm sorry, but Tom retired three months ago. Would you like to speak with our new CTO Dave? Can I ask whose calling? Please hold while I get him on the line.""

After a long time on hold, the receptionist came back on with a curt, ""Dave isn't currently available to speak with you and he said that we no longer do business with your company. Can I take a message?""

What? We just signed a five-year, $3+ million contract. You bet we'd like to leave a message.

CTO Dave called us back the next day. He dove right in and wasn't kind: ""Your company violated our contract and we fired you. When I was hired, we had more than 50 computers that weren't working at all, nothing had been maintained in months, and our printers were a disaster. Every single user had support requests that had never been addressed. This was the most unprofessional thing I've ever seen...you completely abandoned us and we've contracted with CompetitorCorp for our maintenance from now on.""

What again?!?!? Our support manager patiently explained to their CTO that we hadn't abandoned anything and that we had a signed contract stating that we'd only be doing onsites every six months. As for their claims that we'd failed to support them, we pointed out that the company had never logged a single support ticket. We'd have happily fixed anything they requested, but they'd never asked.  The new CTO, looking over a freshly emailed, newly scanned copy of the current, signed contract, was dumbfounded. He'd never seen it before. He'd...have to call us back.

Two days later, our company leadership, CTO Dave, MedGroupCo's CEO, and a bunch of lawyers sat down for a meeting. Apparently, MedGroupCo had a ""cost savings benefit"" they offered to their employees. If you find a way to reduce operating costs, the company will credit the first-year savings to the employee as a ""bounty"". Literally, if an employee found a way to save the company a million dollars a year, they'd give the employee a million dollars. I'd want that deal! CTO Tom wanted that deal too. As it turned out, there had never been any budget cuts. Tom had simply known his retirement was approaching and renegotiated the contract to shave nearly a quarter-million dollars off MedGroupCo's IT maintenance contract...neatly pocketing that quarter-million-dollar ""bounty"" for himself as he headed out the door. 

This deception left MedGroupCo in a tough position. They still had four and a half years left on their five-year, $3+ million contract with our company. And they'd just signed a new five-year, $4 million contract with CompetitorCorp.  Both contracts were binding. MedCoGroup was stuck. 

Because they'd been a customer for so long, our CEO had a bit of sympathy and made them an offer. He'd allow them to end their contract for $1 million, on the stipulation that they sign an agreement to rejoin our company when their 5-year contract with CompetitorCorp expired. He even sweetened the deal by offering to credit the $1 million to their new contract when they returned. They'd been a profitable customer for a very long time, and he was willing to take a short-term hit in exchange for getting them back in the future. MedGroupCo loved the offer and would have signed the agreement right there, but one of our managers picked that moment to bring up another issue by asking, ""Did your contract with CompetitorCorp include equipment? Because if you're not under contract with us we'll need to retrieve all of our leased computers, printers and networking equipment.""

Alas, CompetitorCorps's agreement DID include hardware. And printers. And networking equipment. They'd already swapped everything out with shiny new hardware maintained under CompetitorCorp's own leases. And what had CompetitorCorp done with our hardware? As the story was later told, CTO Dave had told them, ""They abandoned the equipment...just wipe it and send it all to the dump.""

And with that, a $1.4 million dollar equipment loss fee was tacked onto that $1 million buyout, which was promptly refused by MedGroupCo's CEO. The lawyers on both sides went to work feverishly pointing at various clauses in the contracts, trying to negotiate higher ground and paint themselves as the victims in this debacle. Lawsuits were filed. Countersuits were filed. Law enforcement was called in to investigate. Newspapers ran stories about the mean IT company that was trying to fleece money from the poor, poor doctors. And, in the end, MedGroupCo cut us a settlement check for $2 million.   

And CTO Tom? Last I heard, he was enjoying his retirement. He was never arrested, charged, or sued for his role in any of it.",2363,0,1
The computer is broken!,"This happened a *long* time ago. Like 1981 or so. I worked as a ""student consultant"" assisting people with using university mainframe computer systems, but there is not a Tales From Student Consulting subreddit, so here we are. And the moral of the story (see TL;DR) applies to Tech Support. Anyways: These were real mainframes; not minicomputers. Most of the cases I handled were users of a Control Data Corp. (CDC) CYBER 17x proto-super-computer, designed by Seymour Cray before he left CDC to found Cray Computing (but I digress). This was in the days when you submitted your ""program"" to be processed (often on punched cards) and the results were printed on 11 x 14 inch green-bar paper, and delivered to you.

The actors:

**$me:** lowly undergrad hired to this job before my first day of class because I'd already learned the CDC compute environment while I was in High School by sneaking onto college campus and ""obtaining"" access and hacking away until I was quite proficient.

**$gradGuy:** Grad student, older than me, English as a 2nd language, in an unknown program (Math? Physics? Don't know.)

**SCENE**

**$gradGuy:** *(After waiting in line for assistance briefly, and my desk is free, walks up and plops down a three inch think printout on green-bar paper of his FORTRAN program and its output.)* **The computer is broken!**

**$me:** *(Thinking but not saying, this is a mainframe shared by hundreds of people, I think we'd notice if it was broken. What?)* How is it broken?

**$gradGuy:** The computer is broken! I ran this program yesterday fine! Today, *I did not change anything* and it doesn't work! The computer is broken! I did not change anything!

**$me:** *(Trying to calm him down so I can get rational answers.)* Okay. Can you show me why you think it is broken?

**$gradGuy:** Here! Right here! *(Flips to bottom of 3 inches of green-bar output and points to a line in the print-out)* This is not right! Yesterday -- I did not change anything -- it gave right output!

**$me:** *(I begin winding my way through three inches of printout of his FORTRAN code which has produced this bad output. Eventually, after 5 or 10 minutes, I point to a single FORMAT line of code and say)* Here -- this FORMAT statement -- you **must** have changed this today. That is the only way I can see that the computer would have produced the output you are showing me. Did you change this today?

**$gradGuy:** Oh -- that line of code? Yes. I did change that today. *(Picks up three inch printout and silently walks out of consulting office. No apology or thank-you, of course.)*

**TL;DR** and **The Moral Of The Story --** This was probably the first time I learned the First Law of Tech Support: *The customer always lies*. Maybe not intentionally (though sometimes), but almost always. So don't trust what they tell you.

*I dedicate this post to the memory of Joe Tait (RIP), my manager in Student Consulting at the time, a few years my senior, and who hired me as the ""kid who was always in the terminal room and knew the systems and was helping out others in the room even though no-one knew who he was"" (because I was not a student yet and was hacking).*",143,0,1
"Fax machines use ""black magic""","Thought of an OLD one from back when fax machines were still newish and were the go to thing before scanning and email. This is about 19 years ago when I worked at an office supply/equipment sales/service type of store, not a major brand just a local company.

EDIT: I should have said still commonly used, not newish in the above sentence.

We had a customer come and wanted a fax machine for his home office, nothing to major just a plain fax. We had some smaller Panasonic models that used thermal film and had pretty basic features. I showed him the floor model and he said he'd take one. I explained it was a pretty easy setup just plug in the power cord and phone line into the port marked jack , thankfully this is also when companies were brilliant enough to cover the ""phone"" port with a plastic tab you had to break off to plug anything into it. I asked if he thought he'd need help setting it up and if so there would be a minor onsite setup charge, like $25-30 I think. He declined and said he could handle it, it sounded simple and he wasn't an idiot. I got him all set and wished him a good day.

Now normally this is where the story should end, but it wouldn't be in tales from tech support if it was that simple...

I want to say about an hour or two passed till the office gets a phone call from this guy and he is pissed. I take the call since I sold the machine and I'm also one of the techs.

Me: me, surprise
DA: dumb*** customer

Me: hello, this is Me I believe I'm the guy you spoke to in the store when you got the fax machine. What seems to be the problem DA?

DA: This thing doesn't work!

Me: Ok, what exactly is the problem? Is it not powering on? No dial tone? There should only be 2 thing plugged into the machine, are there any error codes on the display?

DA: Its powered on and no errors on the display. I'm not an idiot I set this up like you said. Its not sending my fax out.

Me: Oh, well that is a problem, do you have a dedicated fax line or are using a shared line for fax/telephone?

DA: Dedicated line?

Me: yes, does the fax machine have it's own telephone number or is it using your business phone number?

DA: It's on the same number as my business.

Me: Ok, it's a shared line. Is anyone trying to use the phone when you send a fax?

DA: No

Me: Ok, well why dont you try and send me a fax here at the office, here's the number. Can you call me back after you send it?

DA: Ok, but I'm telling you this won't work.

Me: Let's give this a try and if there's still an issue I'll come out and take a look. No charge if its faulty equipment. I'll bring another machine just incase.

DA: *sighing*  FINE... Let me hang up and try this, I'll call you back.

Me: ok

I wait by our fax machine and within a minute or two I get a fax from this guy, it's an invoice for a customer he needed to bill. I grab it and head to a phone,  waiting for his call back. He calls in and the secretary transferred him over to me.

Me: Hello, everything looks good on my end. Are you sure you had the right number when you tried to fax your customer?

DA: Bullshit, theres no way this worked.

Me: I'm sorry? 

DA: There is no way in hell you got my fax!

Me: Sir I'm not sure what you mean. I'm looking at the invoice you sent me. Why do you say it isn't working?

At this point I'm VERY confused why he's so angry and is dead set that the machine isn't working.

DA: There is no way you got my fax, I'm holding God damn thing in my HAND!!!

Me: . . . . . 

I honestly had no words, nothing... How did he think faxes worked. How do I explain this without pissing him off further? I was so caught off guard I must of been silent for about a minute when he chimes in

DA: WELL?

Me: Um, Sir... the fax machine doesn't send your paper to me. It scans it and sends me a copy that my machine prints out... I can send you the invoice back to your machine to show that I did get it.

DA: oh, no that's fine *click*

I honestly have NO idea how he thought the machine worked. Black magic? Sorcery? Was the machine supposed to teleport the paper through the phone line?

We had an anti stress gag poster on a metal cabinet in the back, the one with the big circle with bang head here till stress goes away.

When DNS is Mandatory,"First time poster, and just a bad typist, so be gentle....any issues were caused by the liberal application of Single Malt Support Lubrication Fluid used after the incident.

I work for a large GPS/cellular tracker company as a Support Engineer for the last 11 years. Last week a customer called in with units they needed to do a radio FW update on, but the update failed every time on every unit. Data to their server and our maintenance server worked fine, as did the initial checkin to start the update, but the file download itself failed.

After  much back and forth and finally obtaining a unit we could pull debug from, I determined that the unit was failing when it switched from UDP (the normal mode the units send data in) to FTP (required by the modem manufacturer to download their firmware file)

Usually FTP or TCP problems are simply the customer's IT or Finance department provisioned the SIMs/Private APN wrong and did not allow the appropriate protocols or ports. But today they managed to find a new way to break things. In order to save money on the private APN, they decided to not pay for DNS support on the network , and of course when we tell the radio where the update file was, we gave the URL for the FTP server along with one-time credentials. No DNS = No download.

Simple solution - we can create a temporary rule on our server to provide the IP instead of the URL to allow them to update their units. (There is a reason - a really stupid but necessary one - that we default to URL instead of IP address). So I request the changes from our ProdOps team and tell the customer to try again in the morning after we update systems overnight.

Ticket moved to ""Pending Resolution"" and on to the next.

The next morning I am greeted by a barrage of ""this is still not working - fix it NOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWW"" e-mails and as the customer starts their day 3 hours before me, there are quite a few. 

So I grab a friendly developer and hop on a conference call with screenshare to watch live debug as the customer attempts a update.

Units boots.....

makes Comm connection....

checks maintenance server...

receives \*you have an update HERE\* response with an IP address instead of a URL.... 

attempts to DNS the IP address.....

fails - ends update.....

Wait...WHAT?!?!?! I gave you an IP address WTF do you want a DNS server?

My developer throws up his hands and says once we hand the IP Address to the radio the entire update is handled by the radio itself without our processor interfering at all. So off to our vendor support number.

\*ring\* \*ring\*

\*explains issue\*

Vendor: Oh yeah - that is functioning as designed - if we cannot get a DNS server, how are we supposed to know the address of the FTP server? So we fail the update out if we cannot reach a DNS server.

Me: But we GIVE you the IP address and port

Vendor: But we still have to look it up to resolve the address!

Me: \*looks for bottle of scotch that is not empty\*

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have to explain to the customer why we need to get on a call with their carrier to see if we can convince them to temporarily enable DNS to get these updates done. 

And then begin the head to wall process of writing a ticket to our vendor trying to explain why this is NOT a very good idea....

"""My screen works fine!... When it's 2/3 down""","As previously mentioned, senior tech support for the fruit-based enterprise. Haven't felt the need to write something up for a while, but this one was fun.

Customer calls in about his laptop having screen issues. It flickers the more it is raised until it turns solid white. However, when the screen is about 2/3 shut, it works fine again.

Now, the model before his has a free repair program for screen issues but the symptom is a complete loss of backlight, you can only tell the screen is on by pointing a flashlight at the fruit logo to make an impromptu backlight. 

He had visited an authorised service provider who quoted him for an out of warranty screen replacement (laptop is 2.5 years old). 

He had called yesterday and told the exact same story to a colleague but he wants a ""different solution"" aka free repair because of the precedent set by the repair program of the previous model. 

After explaining to him that his laptop cannot be covered because it's not the same model neither is the symptom the same, he says:

""I don't understand the need to replace the screen when it's working fine when it's 2/3 down."" 

""Well no, if you can't use the screen it's upright then it's not working fine. If your car is stuck in 2nd gear it's running but it's not fine."" 

After a bit more insisting that we weren't going to cover his issue as it stands and there's no reason to cover the issue for free, he says:

""How do I make you open a repair program? Write up a complaint and let people that have the issue sign up. How many people does you need to open one?"" 

""It's not an per-demand thing, there either needs to be an assumed flaw or a large amount of people reporting the same issue and the same cause. A complaint doesn't do that because it's specific to you and there's no exact number of people that we require to open one.
If anything, you can go to our official forum and explain your situation. If there's a large number of people reporting the same, the mods may take it up the chain.""

""So your solution is to make a forum post instead of fixing my problem?"" 

""A solution has been offered and we support it, the issue to you is that it has a cost. We currently do not feel it's a widespread issue to the point it requires a repair program. If you feel it is, I'll write it down as a complaint on your end. If you want others to express their opinion, the forum post is the best option because we can take action upon it if needs must.""

A sound snafu leads to IT sending the office to sleep,"Hello, TFTS! My first ever post in here, so I hope I've formatted it ok!

I'm relatively new to the world of professional IT, having previously only done tech support for friends, family and myself - so I'm still kind of learning best practice and all that good stuff. I got a job as tech support at a small regional airline just before we locked down for Corona. I'm extremely lucky they kept me on - I'm considered business-critical because, while we're not flying much at the moment, there are still plenty of people working. 

Rather critically to this story though: some people who usually work at home are working in the office, and vice-versa; however it's not always obvious who is where at any one time.

Anyway, that's enough boring preamble.

**$User:** The user requesting my help  
**$Me:** Me  
**$UserBoss:** The boss of the requester

It was a slow day in the IT office, as it kind of has been for the last five months. Suddenly, I'm called into action. A Teams message crops up. It's from someone I'd helped with a sound issue a few months ago (their default output device had randomly changed to something else).

**$User:** Hey, I know you've helped me before - the sound thing has happened again. Can you take a look?

**$Me:** Sure thing. I'll remote in now and have a look for you.

I find **$User**'s PC and set Teamviewer to work. I fiddle about with the sound properties, see it's trying to play through the HDMI instead of the speakers so switch it back and fire up YouTube to test my handiwork. Relaxing whale music is the order of the day.

**$Me:** There you go, should be working now. How're the whales?

**$User:** Nope, sorry. I can't hear anything. What whales?

Haha, silly me. I must have forgotten to turn the volume up. I crank it.

**$Me:** How about now?

**$User:** Nothing. What whales?

Oh no.

I remember, **$User** is now working on a loaner laptop. Her usual desktop machine is being used by a home-worker in the office. My desk phone rings. It's **$UserBoss**.

**$UserBoss:** Hello. Something weird is happening down here. One of our PCs has suddenly started blaring whale music and we're not entirely sure how to stop it. Can you take a look?

**$Me:** Oh. Yeah, that's me. I'm trying to help **$User**, but I forgot she wasn't in the office. I'll kill the whales.

"Almost all of our things are broken, and have been for months... why haven't they been fixed yet?!","Hi all,

Service Biomedical Engineer here. 

We do preventative maintenance and repairs on medical devices. Things like ECG (EKG for the US) machines, patient monitoring (blood pressure monitors, finger pulse meters, syringe drivers (for delivering drugs).

We go to one site that we visit once a year for preventative maintenance.  We sweep through the hospital over a week and try to get everything on our list. We don't do everything, OEMs do a lot of their own gear with their own field engineers. 

Get towards the end of our list and we're missing almost all of one type of unit - infusion pumps. It's a unit where you hang a bag of something and it delivers into a patient via tubing. 

Some of these units also deliver morphine, via a syringe.  They have a lockable case and a push button for on-demand pain relief.

These units are usually everywhere. It's a small hospital and there's something like 30 on the list. 

We ask around and one NUM (nurse unit manager) says 'Oh yeah, we keep them in this locked room'.

Sweet, we head on in and we find almost all the missing units. 

But almost all of them have signs or labels on them saying 'does not work', has X alarm when inserting IV line / syringe. This is like 70% of their fleet of these things. 

Luckily a lot of the repairs look to be simple - the same error on the majority and a quick inspection show the same broken door mechanism that will give an alarm from the unit and prevent medical staff using the unit. It happens when staff are a bit too rough with closing the doors that cover the IV line when you insert it into the unit. 

We inform the NUM and are told they know.  An tech comes through every month or so to fix them up.

Not according to us - we visit once a year, and the hospital can log repair jobs online or call our office to organise repairs. Also, some of these labels are almost 8 months old.  If someone is fixing them, it's not us and they're not doing a good job. 

We ask who the tech is. They give us the name of a previous employee, who hasn't been with us for 2 years.  When he was on the books, this hospital was under a different contract, with hours to visit the site 2 days a month. 

Ok... This isn't good. I make a quick call to our supplier and get confirmation that these mechanisms are available.  They are and we can have them in 2 days. Enough for all the units and some spares. Other really broken units need to be sent to the OEM for repair - they really need to take better care of their stuff. 

I then make a call to my boss.  He tells me that the site knows what contract they have. His boss pulls up the contract to confirm. They've been on this current contract for just under 2 years.  One visit per year for preventative maintenance, all repairs to be raised individually, all billable. 

They probably changed to save money. 

I ask how to proceed.  My boss tells me he's going to inform the site contact that more than half their fleet of pain relief machines are down... And that they need to make sure that repair jobs are logged either online, by email or phone. 

And take photos of the room, clearly showing all the affected units, with the signage. 

I let him know we can get the majority of parts for most of the units within 2 days. We could probably re-commission half the units within 3-5 days. 

Do we take all the affected units off-site? Yes, they can't use them anyway. 

Ok cool... I finish my sweep and we load all repairs into our cars and take them back to the workshop. I order parts, and start getting the units to be sent to the OEM ready for dispatch. 

The next morning my boss gets a call from an angry director, asking where over half their fleet of pain relief machines are. My boss calmly informs them that they're under repair.  

The director says they are now out of machines and need some back now. 

My boss informs them that they don't work if they're faulty, we'll have some back tomorrow hopefully.  They should also know how many faulty units they had, and should have raised repair tickets earlier, as per the contract. They can also call sister sites under the same brand to transfer units. We don't keep spare units of this type. 

The director says that our guys are meant to be there every month.  

My boss informs him of his current contract.  One visit per year, breakdowns need to be raised individually.  Since almost 2 years ago.  Previous director signed it. 

He's going to make a formal complaint. 

My boss says that's within your rights, but we are within our contract. 

Luckily for us, these units are common, and some of the field guys might have some in their stock. I make some calls and come up with 3 units, the guy isn't far away and I can have them in a little over an hour. I let my boss know that I can most likely have 3 units back to them by this afternoon. The rest, we'll have to do wait. 

My boss let's the director know. They're not happy, but want them back ASAP.

My boss advises the director we'll need a PO for all the repairs but we'll have these three back today.

I get the parts, repair the units, re-commission them and drive them back to the site, and deliver them to the ward. The nurses are happy to see the units, the NUM from before isn't happy we took them all, but I let them know they *need* to tell us when stuff is faulty.  We're only here once a year.

We got all the units we could repair with a week.  That was over half the fleet. The rest sent to the OEM took almost a month.

We now get calls to go to that site for repairs almost every month now.",1524,0,1
Yes. That’s how it works.,"I work for a large international bank as local support. It’s not a bad job by any means but some things make me question my own sanity.

The PA of some executive comes to me telling me she has a question. Apparently she needs to upload a picture to a website and she “doesn’t want to give them our system”. I ask her to show me what she exactly means since whilst I do have a clue what she might be referring to, I hope with all my heart she isn’t asking what I think she’s asking.

She proceeds by opening a mail, opens a link waiting till the page loads in the bowser, clicks on the “select picture” button, continues to select the desired image, pauses stares at me and asks.

“So I don’t wanna give [Website] access to our systems! Is this even allowed?”

*Me trying to keep a straight face* “Well, that’s how it generally works yeah.”

*Looking annoyed at me* “Nono, but like this must be against company policy, they have to pick up the picture!” *frowns*

*Really trying to keep myself from not crying out of desperation and disbelief* “Ma’am, thats not how it works.... you choose a file to send them, they don’t have access to anything beyond what you actively select, they don’t pick up anything.”

After a bit more talking she was sufficiently convinced. She told me she never saw anything like this before (which I sincerely doubt), wished me a good day and went off to do god knows what for the remainder of the day. 

Worst thing is that these people make more money in a month than I do in half a year.",1556,0,1
My monitor can work on wifi,"Here is a quick one.

Just fielded a call from a user that said his monitor was no longer working.  It took about 10 minutes of me asking before he told me he changed something.

Turns out he went out and bought two Wifi USB adapters and plugged one into his monitors usb port and one into his PC.   Then proceeded to try and connect his computer to the monitor through wifi.  It took almost 15 minutes for me to explain that is not how it works even though he insisted it would (he is an accountant btw).  He then proceeded to sent me a link to a monitor that can connect via wifi as though that somehow proved his wifi adapters trick works and I just didn't want to help him figure it out.  Also got annoyed that he spent $140 on a wifi adapters and apparently can't return it (not sure why though and not sure why he spent $140 on it), he is going to be less happy when he finds out I am billing him for the time.

I bet he is going to spend the next few hours trying to get it to work with the chant of I can't wait to prove them wrong on repeat in his head.

-  C: hey yes this is C and this is my service ID, my internet and tv is not working 
- me: okay lets check your service please hold (I already checked and it should be working as far as I can tell but I cannot ping/get response from customers end point so I check if something major happened to the area. it seems tv and internet should be working as we did not receive any major overarching issue in the area)


- me: okay so have you tried restarting your endpoint?

- C: yes for the 3rd time but no dice
- me: okay could you please tell me what do you see when you try to connect to the internet?(I made a mistake here accepting that the customer knows basic troubleshooting)

-  C: well nothing much really...

-  me: okay lets try connecting now to our adsl service (for those who do not know adsl is internet service over phone lines that require username+pw to connect before using it)

- C: okay...(a minute passes hearing some muttered curses)

- me: may I help? what seems to be the problem? (setting up adsl connection was a free service but troubleshooting it was beyond my scope but I was trying to solve it without L2)

-  C: I cant connect to the damn thing and I need  to work! Even my damned monitor is broken now this...

- me: may I ask what happenend to the monitor?  (a sneaking suspicion starts crawling up my spine)

- C: umm yeah it was just all black, I came home plugged in my laptop and my monitor, but it wont show anything...

- me: sir, would you please try to press the power button on the monitor?

- C: Already tried it, I told you it must be broken it does not even light up!!

-  me: Sir, please try and turn on the lights for me in the room..

- C: hmm...it does not work either...

- me: Sir your internet does not work because there is NoPOWER in your house I think you should contact your power provider do you want me to search for their hotline?

- C:... please do...",382,0,1
That’s not how the world works,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I just encountered two of the most clueless users ever and I just had to share.

Background: I am working tech support in a medium sized company and most users are quite nice and helpful in solving their problems, but some just seem to have no idea how the world works. I met the same kind of stupid twice the last days, so this story consists of two parts.

#Part 1: My program is gone 

A nice lady asked me to install a program for her, as she can’t do it herself, because our users don’t have admin privileges on their machines. I gladly help her, it’s done in less than five minutes. Next day she calls me, upset, an tells me the program is gone. When I try to remote to her machine, it turns out she is using a colleagues notebook and login. So ... the program is not there because it is a completely different device.

#Part 2: My phone is not ringing

We are not using normal phones, but a software to call and answer calls from your computer. Works pretty well so far, until this user contacted me and told me the following. When he gets a call, it doesn’t ring, he just gets a notification, no audio. So I tried the obvious things first: does windows have the correct audio device selected? Is the audio device turned on? Are the software settings correct? I just couldn’t find the problem. It took me longer than I like to admit to figure that the user simply *isn’t using his headset*. Like, it’s on his desk, he just couldn’t be bothered to wear it and only uses it after answering a call. 

I’m still baffled. Just how do these people think that stuff works? Black magic?

Also, English is not my first language, so feel free to correct any errors and typos. 

Edit: typo

Edit 2 (a little late, but it was night over here): because it gets mentioned frequently, user 2 doesn’t have speakers on his computer, otherwise I would totally do what you guys are saying about letting the speaker ring. Also, he is using the system for over a year now, so either he never asked or just recently forgot how the system works.

Anyway, thank you all for the comments and your own stories, I really enjoyed reading!",1739,0,1
Serious Issue Sunday,"So, Sunday Morning at 10 am as I’m getting ready to head out for a day at the nearby lake, my phone dings. Subject: “Serious issue”

I was near my work computer, sat down, started to call the user, and I read the ticket the computer had blue screened.

The user had tried to shut it down for the weekend, but I guess it blue screened in the process.

(Crap, this could have waited.)



By the time I read the ticket all the way through the user answered. 

Me: (Mustering up my, “I’m not mad that you sent this in on a Sunday voice”) Hi there!

User: Oh, hi. I was not expecting you to call me today.  

 Me: …(internal sigh) not a big deal.
 Have you tried to hard reset it yet?  

 User: What’s that?  

 (Thinking to myself, This is why you get paid, this is why you get paid.)  

 Press the power button until the light turns off, and press it again to power it back on. 

User: Oh, it is powering up now, and I can sign in. Thank you for the call.  

Me: No problem, have a nice Sunday.     
   
 


All well, it was 5 minutes on a Sunday, that means 5 minutes I can use to create a Reddit post on Monday, right?",323,0,1
Sorta mature tech support,"Cast:
ME: me
BB: brainfart brother

Sorry for grammar and spelling, I'm not that good at English. And sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile.


Soo... Basically my brother has one last project for school this year (first year towards his medical degree) he has this problem with his laptop, and since I am quite good with PC's he asked me for help and the following happened:


ME: so, what is wrong?

BB: I accidentally deleted this file that contained almost all of my project.

ME: is it not just in the trash bin?

BB: see, that's the problem, the trash bin is gone.

ME: what do you mean the trash bin is gone? 

So here I just do a quick Google search on how to get your trash bin back (apparantely you can disable it).

ME: could you please let me on the PC for a moment so I can get the trash bin back?

BB: yeah, sure

I look in the settings and see it was actually enabled so idecide it is very unlikely that it is actually gone so I take another look at his desktop, and low and behold, the file is in  there.

ME: het BB, look, i found it, it is literally right there.

BB: dang, thanks man

So... Turns out this dude just spent almost an hour looking for his trash bin, and it was just there all the time.

TLDR: my brother spent an hour looking for his trash bin and probably glanced right past it like, 10 times.

Edit: spelling",162,0,1
In which a user's monitor is not working,"I am relatively new to the IT industry, and work as a service coordinator at a small MSP. I don't typically work tickets, but I do try to ask the easy questions and walk users through little things if I think it can be handled in 5-10 minutes. This morning I got a call from a user having issues with setting up a monitor. She had been working remotely and needed a second monitor, so she picked one up from the office and was having issues getting it to work at home. Her first issue was finding a cord to connect the monitor to her laptop, but thankfully she was able to track one down. That is where our conversation picks up.

&amp;#x200B;

User: I found a cord for my monitor, but when I plug it in both screens go black

Me: Ok, what kind of cord is it?

User: \*describes an analog cord\*

Me: Hmm, you probably just need to change the input on your monitor. Do you see any buttons on the side of your monitor?

User: No.

Me: What about on the bottom?

User: Yes, \*proceeds to describe said buttons\*.

Me: Great. Please press the menu button for me.

User: Nothing is happening.

Me: Is the monitor turned on?

User: How would I know if it's on or not?

Me: When you press the power button, does the light turn on or off?

User: Hmm

Me: ...Is the power cord plugged into the wall?

User: I need a power cord?

&amp;#x200B;

Once the cord in question was retrieved from the office, we were able to get her monitors set up the way she liked them without issue.",271,0,1
backup ... we have a backup!,"Hey it´s me again. The trainee from the coal plant that now works with industrial robots.  
I looked in my reddit-history and found out that I didnt post anything for a while.

Because I have plenty of storys, there will be a few in the feature.  
It´s the same spiel as everytime: I speak german as my first language, so you will find a lot of errors ;)

&amp;#x200B;

Okay let´s jump to the story:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

cast:

  
$me: plc and robot programmer for a while now  


$customer: company that has a lot of mills - mostly Haas (when you are from the US, you can know them).

&amp;#x200B;

story:

&amp;#x200B;

This customer has an robotcell from us, that we installed 3-4 years ago. My standard is to make a backup at delivery of the robotcell, and show the customer how to make the backups to an usb-drive. 

Fast forward to now. I get a call from the customer. I switched companys two times since then, and he used his old KGB-Skills to track me down. He has a problem - the robotcell is not able to read the programdata. Nice. I get to him, and have a look. In the robotcell is an old industrial-pc with windows xp embedded (shudder) which is running from an cf-card. (more shudder). The partition with the programdata is not readable, and I try a few things. I ask the customer for the latest backup... and gues what? He has a backup! He proudly strolls away to get it, only to find out that the latest backup is from 2 weeks after my initial backup. I ask him how many new programs he created since then, and he tells me about 25. Okay nice. You need about 3-4 hours to recreate a program - so it´s a lot of time lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tell him we can try a data-recovery - but the chance is not very high that it will work out.  
I give him the estimated numbers, and its a lot less und a lot faster then doing everything from scratch, but tell him again that the chance is not very high. I get the workorder from him, and begin working on it. 

First recovery-tool -&gt; Nothing

Second -&gt; Nothing

Third -&gt; Hey there is an drive... but data? nope!

I wanted to give up, but found another tool my luck. But i costs a few hundred bucks.

I call the customer, and get the go.

The tool works like charm.

&amp;#x200B;

The customer gets a new CF-Card and the newest backup and is happy again.

Fast forward a few weeks - I visited the customer, he tells me that there are 5 new products on the machine. I ask if he has an backup... he runs away and grabs an usb-drive... 

The day after I get a phone call - the IT-Admin. He wants to make backups of the pc every day now. We implemented it and verified the backups.

&amp;#x200B;

So we sort of have a happy ending here.",1295,0,1
The time I took a 4 hour job and turned it into 6 keystrokes and two button clicks.,"Obligatory this happened a few years ago and I'm not in I.T. but I'm a ""techy kinda guy"". Also - it's a bit of a long one... (sorry!)

A few years back I was a Production Supervisor for a manufacturing company. Part of the job involved booking batches into stock once they'd been completed, generally into separate parts (so for instance, one batch could make 30 smaller batches or 100 or so on). Once complete and divided up, this involved manually going into each ""Page"" for each separate batch and adding in additional info as to details of the batch.

This could take a while to type it all out...

After a couple of weeks of doing this (I'm a little ashamed it took me this long!) I got sick of having to type out all of the same info into each page. So I stopped what I was doing and thought about how I could make this easier for myself and how I could automate the process.

After some time playing around I realised that I could bring up all pages of each of the smaller batches at once - and could switch between them with CTRL+Up/Down and that wherever the cursor was it would stay in the respective field - so I could cut and paste it relatively easily. This was good - but would still take far too long. Frustratingly - I couldn't install any extra software as the I.T. Department has locked it down pretty well and was pretty restrictive (fair enough, but it didn't really help me).

After a bit of Googling around I figured out that VBS scripts might be my answer. For those who don't know - VBS scripts can ""imitate"" keystrokes, can be made in Notepad, and don't need installing. Having never made one before in my life I thought I'd give it a go.

I wrote myself a little template for the info and made it so that I would type the variable into the first fieldand hit go on the script. It would cut and paste the variable into the relevant places, type out the rest of the template, copy the entire set of text, save the record, and move down to the next page. After that it went onto ""Phase 2"" which was a case of: Paste, Save, Move to next Record, and so on.

I had to add in some ""Waiting"" time to allow for the record to save otherwise it would try and do things too quickly and mess up the order, but other than that, it worked remarkably well. All I needed to do was copy ""Phase 2"" part of the script and paste it about 500 times, so that it would keep running. Luckily when it got to the final record all it would do was overwrite the entire field and resave it, so it didn't cause me any issues.

Overall, took me about a day to teach myself what to do, and about half of the next day playing around and troubleshooting. But boy.... this baby saved me SO much time in the long run.

What used to take me 2-4 hours (depending on how many ""sub-batches"" there were, now took me all of 10 seconds and I could walk away, let the computer do it's thing, and do something else in the office.

Once, I nearly got caught using it when someone who sat nearby asked what my computer was doing moving around without me doing anything with it (I was working through a worksheet at the time and clearly not on it). I just muttered something about it had been playing up lately and I needed to take it to I.T. She gave me an odd look, but just left it alone.",3021,0,1
You should have INSISTED!,"Back in 2005, we did some random work a real estate type business. 4 PCs + central file/app server, and they used their ISP for email.

After doing a few fairly routine jobs (slow computer, can't print, that kinda thing), we worked out that they had zero backups, and no backup solution/plan.

Being a fairly responsible person, I let them know this, and they really should do something about it. I was just fobbed off at the time.

I even prepped a quote for 3 external drives and some basic scripting to handle their simple backup needs. Were talking sub AUD$500 here. Emailed with a note explaining what it is, how they could keep a drive offsite, and why it's a really good idea to substantially reduce the chance of disaster. Again, fobbed off. 

I'm guessing they really diddn't want to pay for something they ""diddn't need"". 

You can probably see where this is going. The inevitable happens. The (single) hard drive in their server fails.

After the usual ""how could you let this happen"", I point out how I mentioned this to them, and showed them the aforementioned email.

15 years later, and can remember what the owner of this company said to me next

""You should have INSISTED we need it""",385,0,1
Travelled 2 hours to fix a PC,"A good friend of mine asked for help with their broken PC. I work in IT and I am their systems admin so it's no big deal to help. I brought all my tools with me, screw drivers, installers, etc. Travelled 2 hous with another friend because it's a long trip. I don't have a car that time and we had to commute. 

Cut the story short, they said it just stopped working. Yeah. When we arrived it really isn't turning on. The AVR is powered on but the PC won't boot. Apparently the computer was unplugged from the AVR and that fixed everything. 

They wanna die of embarrassment.

Edit: The PC has been “broken” for months!",178,0,1
Something a little different concerning email,"A Self-Confessing Food Thief started our org's path down the limitation of our email distribution lists.  Here's how it happened.

We worked in the headquarters of a nationally-recognized organization, with hundreds of people and a ton of interns who were very overworked.  One day, as I was about to head home, I received an email addressed to everyone in the organization (way back in the 90s when that was still allowed).  It went something like this:

""Hi, my name is Joe Intern.  My manager had me working on a project that took me almost the entire day.  By the time I had finished, all the lunch street vendors had gone home and I did not bring a lunch.  I had not had breakfast, and in retrospect, I probably should have.  By this time, I was starving, so I did something shameful that I will now confess to.  I stole food.  I looked in the refrigerator, and there it was.  A shiny, delicious-looking apple.  I was famished and in a moment of weakness, I ate it.  I ate it all, even the core.  Only the stem was left.  So to whoever owned that apple, I am sorry.  Just let me know if that apple was yours and I will pay you back tomorrow.  Thank you, and again, I apologize.""

It was one of the greatest emails I had read in my life.  That dude also got more invites to lunch for the next couple of weeks than I had ever seen.  And oh, the head of the org had me shut down the capability of just anyone (like interns) being able to send an email to the Everyone group.",347,0,1
That time I got fired half way through rewiring a floor,"This is a year old, had to wait to talk about it

I was working for a company as this weird level IT Support. Like I couldn't do ANYTHING except the base level that a semi-tech savy person could do. Most of my work was mounting monitors since the building was still setting up in the early days, the most tech savy part was this story.  


One of the \*actual\* technicians (i.e. has a local admin password) asks me to map out the entire building's network ports, since we didn't have a port map for the building. After I've done this, word comes down to remap the entire floor with only odd ports needed.  


I organize it so people have wifi/work from a different area for a half day while I unplug a floor at a time and re-cable it. 500 ports per floor, roughly half a day once I'm done dealing with people calling to complain I killed their internet despite multiple warnings.  


I finally finish pulling out all of the 3rd floor (also the execs floor) cables so I can cable manage the new odd only set up, when my boss calls me into a meeting room and informs me I'm being let go.  
They escort me out of the building, no chance to fix up floor 3, which now has 1 active AP.

Install this urgent update! But I'm not going to give you a time to install it. Because I can't click a button.,"So I've lurked around here a while, enjoying the IT horror stories here and there. Figured it's time I finally started sharing some of my own.

It's a bit long so...

TLDR: PITA Accountant demanded I install an ""urgent"" update. Then fought me for over a week and wouldn't give me a time to install said update. Eventually got the update installed and then found she was fighting me over the install because she jacked up the accounting records and was trying to fix them before the update. Turned out she simply didn't run the report and it required clicking one menu item, one item in a list, and then one button to ""fix"" this and run the report.

At one job, had an accountant, who got promoted to controller (head of the accounting department), who was single handedly responsible for no less than 7 people leaving that place in a short few months (and several more after I left from what I have been told). Mind you this was a small non-profit with less than 50 employees. (This comes into play later). She will be referred to as PITA Accountant.

The accounting group had 3 people who accessed this one piece of software as well as another person in HR. The usual server software on our application software and the workstations have the client installed. To install an update meant everyone had to be out of that system. Any time updates would come out, she'd be harassing me the day of release to update it. Give her the usual why is this so urgent, blah, blah. Every time our director would say just get it done.  Ok... 

Me: I need everyone OUT of the software for a few hours so I can install your URGENT update. Let me know when that's done. 


PITA Accountant: Well we can't get out now we have work to do.

Me: Well I was told this was URGENT.

PITA Accountant 2 DAYS later in an email about 15 minutes before closing time: We're out of the software. You can install the update.

Me: No, I cannot. It is now 15 minutes before COB, and I told you I need a few hours to complete the update.

PITA Accountant: Why do you need a few hours? It doesn't take that long to install software.

Me: Listen, I don't tell you how to do your job, don't tell me how to so mine.

PITA Accountant: Well can't you just stay late and install it when nobody is in the office?

Remember I said it was a small non-profit? Overtime pretty much did not exist. And being the only IT staff, I pretty much had to be in the office when users were unless we had some major work being performed, such as server replacements.

Me: Seeing as how you are in charge of the finances for the entire organization, I am absolutely sure you are aware that we have been over budget for the entire year since the 1st quarter, since YOU decided to just create our IT budget on your own with absolutely no input from me. So to answer your question, no, I will not be staying late to install the software.

Didn't hear anything back for a couple of days again until I get harassed by the director about why this update has not been installed.

At that point went and talked to the other two accounting staff and the HR staff about scheduling a time to install the update. (These two I was friendly with and actually enjoyed personally interacting with)

Me to Accountant A: Hey. I'm trying to get this update installed and need everyone out of the system.

Accountant A: I did my monthly work in there last week. I don't need to touch it for another few weeks. We only run those reports at the end of each month.

Me: Hmmm. Really? Thanks!

Me to Accountant B: Hey. I'm trying to get this update installed and need everyone out of the system.

Accountant B: My work in there was done last week when we ran the reports.

Me: Great! Thanks!

Me to HR: Hey. I'm trying to get this update installed and need everyone out of the system.

I hardly ever touch that system. I only use it if PITA Accountant isn't here and I need to enter everybody's leave time.

Me: Thanks for your help!

Back to my desk to fire off a reply to the director and PITA Accountant.

Me: I was told this update was URGENT and have been trying to schedule a time to to install the update since last week. I have spoken to Accountant A, Accountant B, and HR. They have informed me they have completed their monthly work in the system and these reports are only run at the end of each month. As I told PITA Accountant, I need a few hours to complete the update. This first response from PITA Accountant came 15 minutes before COB indicating they were out of the system. I then reiterated I needed several hours to complete the update. PITA then asked if I could work late to install the update. I reminded her we have already been over budget for months and staying late and accruing overtime was not an option, which she should be aware of as she prepares our monthly financial reports.  

About another 2 days later, I finally get a response from PITA Accountant, first thing in the morning that everyone was out of the system and it could be updated. 

Complete the update and all is good. Yay!

Within the next couple of days I randomly stop to BS with Accountants A and B and come to find out that PITA Accountant was constantly in the system because she fucked up a number of records in the software and couldn't figure out why... Dollar amounts were thousands off from what they should have been...

Great... They're going to blame this on the update and on me...

Sure enough a day or two later PITA Accountant sends me and the director email with their reports that show the discrepancy indicating this was not an issue before the update.

Get up from my desk and walk to PITA Accountant's office.

Can you show me these reports? 

PITA Accountant proceeds to show me.  I see that she can also pull up all of the old reports that were run.

Me: Can you print out these two reports for me quick so I can go try to figure out what is going on?

PITA Accountant prints them. I grab them from the printer and take a look...

Takes me all of 20 seconds to see that there are pretty much exactly a months worth of transactions missing from this latest report.

Me in an email to PITA Accountant and the director: I see in the attached report that there are no transactions listed for the past month. Can you go verify that you did in fact run the report for last month?

About 20 minutes later...

Email from PITA Accountant: I verified that these transactions are entered but I still cannot see them in the report.

Great...

Walk over to PITA Accountant again.

Me: Can you show me how you generate these reports?

PITA Accountant clicks a single menu item and brings them up.

Me: Wait. This report has a flag on it here. It says you prepared it but didn't actually run it.

PITA Accountant selects the report and clicks the run report button.  

Numbers are now correct... 

I just let out a long sigh and walk back to my desk mumbling a very long stream of NSFW comments to myself...

So glad I left that place...",1403,0,1
Keep talking about WiFi and I’ll speak to your supervisor.,"This happened a month or so ago, I don’t remember verbatim what was said except for one part of the conversation that confused/surprised me. I work for an ISP that provides cable tv, internet, and phone services. On this particular day this customer called in because he was having trouble with this internet. 

Me = Me 
Grumpy = Customer

Me: Thank you for calling (company) name, how can I help you. 
 
Grumpy: I don’t have any internet and want to find out why.

Me: Sure, let me take a look for you. (I Pull up account and log into the modem here) I’m showing your modem is online.

Grumpy: But I don’t have internet....

Me: Which connection are we using to access the internet? Are we using a wired connection or are you connecting to the WiFi network? 

Grumpy: I’m using the internet to connect....

Me: I understand, but to access the internet we have to make a connection. Which connection are we using, the wired connection or the WiFi connection. 

Grumpy(getting angry for seemingly no reason):You Listen here, I’m trying to connect to the in-ter-net. I don’t have WiFi, I don’t use WiFi, I don’t like WiFi, and if you keep running your mouth about WiFi then I want to speak to your supervisor. 

Me: I apologize if we’re having an misunderstanding, what type of device are you using to connect to the internet? 

Grumpy: A tablet. 

Me:  And the tablet is wireless, right?

Grumpy: Yes.

Me: Can we make sure it’s connected?

Grumpy: How do we do that?

I then navigated him to the settings menu and then WiFi settings.

Me: You see, you ARE using WiFi and when you connect to the WiFi, you’re going to want to connect to the one that says (whatever his network name was)

The fact that he got so upset for asking if he was using a wired or WiFi connection baffled me. He was nice, if a little short with his tone at first, but then to blow up over mentioning WiFi.... I don’t get it. I savored the moment when he had to go into the WiFi settings to connect to his WiFi network. He ended up getting connected and was able to use the internet again.",2252,0,1
"Entitled user prefers decade-plus old system, gets RTFM'd by my boss"," 

It's hard for me to convey just how entitled this user was in simple text. Suffice it to say she shrieked, yelled, demanded, attempted emotional extortion, threatened and begged over the course of this incident. She would seamlessly switch tactics as each one failed, and when others got involved would start over in her playbook. Taken as a whole it was almost laughable, but if you came in halfway through it probably would have looked like she was genuinely in distress. Thankfully it was just me and another veteran in the trenches.

And so, on to the story:

We had just modernized our Citrix environment recently. Moved from a dusty closet three states away to a nice colo center 30 minutes up the road with shiny new servers. (Moving from 2008-era hard drives to PCIe SSDs that are literally 100x faster is probably the biggest upgrade, but  more, faster cores and a lot more RAM isn't bad either.) About 1/4 of  the company has been migrated to the new system and it's actually going  smoothly overall except for folks who didn't get the memo and are still  trying to log onto the old server. We started this Monday and the whole  company is due by Thursday, with Friday for last minute customer surveys and the weekend to fix any issues that crop up.

Since  I was on point for vetting all of our thin clients and was at least in  the call for most of the app testing if not on point, guess who was  catching most of the Citrix support calls? (So yeah, late night upgrades  to the thin clients I'd finally gotten automated followed by full time  support of the new environment. Then they furloughed me for a week once  things were calm which I actually kind of needed.)

I  go online at 7AM, this call came in at about 8:15AM, roughly 15 minutes  after our Entitled User signed on. At least she gave it the old college try. (Until this point he morning had been pretty quiet.)

Me: IT Helpdesk, ATG speaking. (Customer Service voice in full effect.)

Entitled User (EU):  I need you to move me back to the old Citrix. (Unless your entire department is unable to work that's not happening. We already tested  extensively, had test users for every app from every department.)

Me:  Okay... can you tell me what kind of problems you've been having this  morning? (From her number I knew she was in the most recent batch of  migrations.)

EU: I can't use the new Citrix.

Me: Let me just check here... I show you as logged in as a Power User. Are you having some trouble?

EU: I can't use the new Citrix.

I'm starting to get the picture.

Me: I'm sorry to hear that. Can we go over what you can't use?

EU: (Huffy) I can't log into &lt;ERP Solution&gt;.

Admin console says she doesn't even have the program running.

Me:  All righty. If it's okay with you I'd like to mirror your screen so I  can see exactly what's wrong. (She assents, I push the button.) I can  see your screen now. Can you try to open &lt;ERP&gt; and log on?

EU: I can't log on.

Me: Ah, all right. Can you try to log on so I can  see what error message you're getting?

EU: I can't! The icon is missing!

There  it was. We moved their files but not their profiles for obvious reasons. So yeah, icons compressed themselves to the far left of the  screen and weren't where they were yesterday. This was well documented  (with pictures!) and she was literally the only person out of the nearly  three hundred we'd moved over to mention this as an issue.

Me:  I see. If you'll let me control your mouse I can try and fix that for  you. (Assents again, another button.) Okay, if you look over on the left  here, all your icons are there  just they're jumbled up. (Sorts icons  by name.) Here's &lt;ERP&gt;, I'm going to create some shortcuts for you  on the taskbar and Start Menu so you can find it easier next time. Are  there any any other programs or files you need to find?

EU: No, I can't use any of this. You need to put me back on the old Citrix! (She's actually angry now.)

Me:  We're not really able to do that. Everyone's being moved to the new  Citrix this week and after that the old system is being shuttered  completely.

EU: What?! Appeasing Manager (AM) told  me that we'd be able to switch back if we had a problem! (AM is her  boss, and it was getting pretty obvious why he said that but damn, way  to throw me under the bus.)

Me: I  can't speak for anyone outside of IT, but the bulletin that came out  Monday has the whole project schedule. Next Monday we're shutting down  the old servers for good. (Unless there is a major, MAJOR issue, for  which PEBKAC does not qualify. Not telling her that.)

EU: (No joke it sounds like she's getting ready to cry now, but still angry.) I can't work like this!

Now  there's mumbling in the background, sounds like AM is trying to talk  her off the ledge. I really wish he hadn't because I can hear EU getting angrier and suddenly she's back on the line in full rage mode.  It takes years of training before you can learn to sweet talk (read:  blow smoke and BS) at my level, and he wasn't there yet.

EU: You need to make it so I can work again! I can't work like this, this is unbelievable!

Me:  Ma'am, even if I could move your files back to the old system (could do  that, but won't) you'd still lose your icon arrangements and favorites  again. That's just what happens when we copy you over to a different  server. I'm more than happy to take some time to work with you until  everything's back the way you like it.

Totally  not happy to do that, we've all got more important things to do than  play ""Hunt the Icon"" with EU feat. AM, but it's obvious  I'm not seeing the back of her til she's satisfied and married life has  taught me how that works. If I brushed her off she'd call again and get  someone else and ruin their morning, or call a VP or something and we'd  get it from both ends until we could explain our process for the  fiftieth time.

It takes about ten  minutes to get her away from having a tantrum because Windows Server  2016 terminals don't look exactly like Windows Server 2008 terminals and  onto actually fixing the problem. She was trying to shriek at me every  so often but hey, headsets have volume controls and she gave up on it  when I didn't react. She adamantly refuses to take control while I'm  doing this, just giving orders. Notably, she is not good at remembering  the actual names of files or programs - anything more complicated than  ""Excel"" involved opening all potential candidates until she recognized  the program or document.

EU: It's a Word file, it had all my customer transactions from last month.

Me: Can you remember any words from the file name? Like transactions, or customer?

EU: It was on the top left of the screen. (For the tenth time, I can't tell where an icon used to be.)

Me: &lt;Opens file&gt; Is this it? I see customer names and the dates are from last month.

EU: No, that's customer payments. (Note: File name included zero permutations of customer or payment. And it ended up being an Excel file.)

About  25 minutes of ""unbelievable"" and ""unacceptable"" and ""I can't work like  this"" later and her screen is an amorphous blob of icons in something resembling the order in which she thought things should be. Then comes  fifteen minutes of watching her log into every... single... solitary...  program that has a login to make sure it works. Then a three minute  complaint about how the Start Menu looks different until I show her how  to type and search for programs/files and how much faster that is. Then a  five minute tirade about how much work she's missed (wonder what that  feels like) and she's asking for my manager's name.

Because how else do we know she's entitled?

Now  the thing is I do not have a manager per se, because it's hard to  manage the longest serving tech in the company when you're asking him  how things work five times a day. I have people above me in the org  chart who give me policy to implement and otherwise leave me alone as I  write documentation and find processes to automate. Said IT Head has  been pulling just as many hours as I have, is less people oriented, and  has been in meetings with department heads since 6AM his time trying to  accommodate demands that actually impact more than one user. He knows I  work my butt off  to keep things off his desk but can't refuse a direct  request like this.

So I give her  his low priority, goes straight to voicemail, if you were important  enough to know his real number you'd already have it number. Then I IM'd him the situation without specifying a desired reaction. We're far past the point where that's necessary.

Wasn't  privy to the conversation later that day (I'm imagining no less than  five voicemails before he returned her call) but it ended up being IT  Head cutting her off mid-rant, referring her to the exhaustive, ""follow  this pictorial how-to"" documentation she hadn't read, then asking to  speak to HER manager with instructions that she would not be allowed to lodge another Citrix related ticket until and unless he had signed off on her reading and following said document. (We would know, setup steps left telltales.) Then came an email to the helpdesk citing this and a clarification that users be directed to the documentation for any Citrix issues unless the documentation was wrong or the issue was non-BAU like  a couple issues where wonky permissions caused the first logon script  to fail.

Harsh? Maybe, but  remember we'd tracked more than a hundred users not having any issues  and her entire complaint was ""Things moved around and I don't like it.""

Ultimately  though, the reception was really good for the new system. It's not,  like, desktop speed but compared to the spaghetti mess it replaced with  literally decade newer hardware and coherent systems design it's way  better. We actually had users emailing about how much better it was. Our  whole team pulled a lot of OT in the middle of a pandemic (mostly WAH -  thanks virtual environments!) making sure every duck was in its row and  every department signed off on being able to work before we pulled the  trigger. This was literally one entitled user out of about five hundred users to lodge a serious complaint when all was said and done.",388,0,1
"Needless to say, this is proving to be a long day.","This played out over the course of 50 minutes. The whole process takes less than 5, even for a client who encounters the issue here, and I usually only have to send them the template for resolving it. It was a chat contact, (XYZ) shall be my internal plight, Me is me, Him is the client. Caps lock is for placeholders to anonimize things. It has been simplified and a bit cut down due to translation, and field-specific language, but imagine that he had basically every detail wrong. It also arrived 5 minutes before I would have left on a break…

\*standard introductions from both of us\*

Him: I would like to add new THING to my company. I was told that I can do this on SITE

Me: Indeed, on SITE, under the company tab, after logging in.

Him: I clicked on send, but it says I need to add at least one electronic notification address. Nothing has happened ever since

Me: Yes, you need to go back to notification data step, click on THIS button, then Add New, and Save. You need not actually fill out anything.

Him: okay, hopefully it will work.

Me: \*after several minutes\* Was it successful?

Him: I logged in, but I do not see the notification data step.

Me: Please click on back from the final step, until you see it.

Him: I am in WRONG PLACE.

Me: Then please click on THING, and choose THING. It will be one of the first steps.

Him: Am I supposed to be elsewhere?

Me: Please follow the steps above.

Him: I am in RIGHT THING, my data, and the only thing I see is the Next button.

Me: One of the steps will be the notification data, it will literally not let you miss it. Just click next until you see it.

Him: Is it not supposed to write it on my personal data?

Me: (Is he actually on OTHER page that has nothing to do with this…?) Are you on WRONG PAGE right now, by any chance?

Him: I am at RIGHT PLACE, and there is no e-mail address here.

Me: (No one even said anything about an e-mail) Yes, just click Next.

Him: The next page only has THING and THING as well…

Me: (my descent into madness start around here, and only gets worse) The form has more than two pages, please hit Next again. You can see on the top, what page you are on, and which one you need.

Him: It says STILL ON SAME PAGE

Me: Hit next.

Him: Now I am at Notification data.

Me: Please click on THIS, then New Address, and Save. You need not actually type in anything.

Him: So, I do not have to give anything?

Me: No, please just follow the above steps.

Him: Alright, I am now on NEXT PAGE.

Me: I see. Can I help you with anything else? (You can tell, I really wanted to escape already…)

Him: So Should I choose THING THAT WOULD SENT HIM BACK TO STEP ONE AND IS NOT EVEN PART OF THE FORM from above? (No, why would you even think that?!)

Me: No, that would restart the process.  Please keep hitting next and then hand in the form.

Him: So should I add in the new things here that I wanted to do this for? (…….You should not be allowed to vote… )

Me: Yes…. Yes, you should do the thing you came here to do.(paraphrased)

Him: And should I click the Modify button?

Me: Yes, then keep hitting Next and hand it in. (Yes, press the button that actually does the change)

Him: It asks me to accept a LEGAL THING.

Me: Yes, you have to state that you are legally allowed to do what you do.

Him: It shows my new THING, so next?

Me: Yes…

Him: It says I am done with filling out the form and I can hand it in. I got here yesterday as well, but then it did not let me hand it in.

Me: Now you did the thing that allows you to hand it in, so it will work.

Him: It says the same thing as yesterday. FULL ERROR ID

Me: (……. I headbutted the table in half at this point) You did not do what I told you to do. Please keep hitting Back, and do the thing. (Paraphrased)

Me: (after several minutes) Did you succeed?

Him: There is no Add New at Notification data, only Add New Address.

Me: (….are you fucking kidding me….. nevermind how absurd that excuse is, I know for a fact that it is not so, but I am not sure which version I would first revoke your breeding license for)

Him: Anyway, I will click on Add New.

Me: (oh, no Address there suddenly?) Good, then click on THING and save, then hand in the form

Him: See? this is the information I was missing so far!

Me: (…. I told you 3 times this exact thing already…)

Him: So now I have to restart from scratch, yes?

Me: (………how did you even come to that conclusion) No. You already did the change. Just hit Next and hand it in.

Him: (formalities after success) This site is really not user friendly, and I should know, I have been teaching IT for years.

Me: (The site is very simple, but not quite as much as you seem to be……But wait… You do what…….?)

Me: Have a nice day, and thank you for contacting us. (I hope you swallow a toothpick sideways.)",222,0,1
What Do You Mean You Need To Talk To The Person ACTUALLY Having The Issue?!,"Hello all,

Long time lurker first time poster here in this wonderful subreddit.

So before the story begins I want to explain a few things to help you better understand somethings, I am fairly new at the company I currently work at, but have been doing IT support for 4 years total to this point.  All names are changed to protect privacy.

The cast:

* Me: the narrator of this story
* Karen: She's a Karen need I say more?

So the day beings as normal, calls come in and I take them so far no issues everyone I've spoken with up to this point was patient and just really nice.

Then Karen called, the following is roughly what happened on that conversation;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: Hello, thank you for contacting \[insert company name here\] can I have your employee ID?  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: Yes it's \[redacted\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Thanks how can I help you today?  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: So I have some users at my site working from home cause of the pandemic as you know. I need you to help them out.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay, if you could have them call in we can definitely assist them.

Now this sounds like a completely reasonable request right? Not to Karen it didn't

&gt;Karen: What you mean they need to call in?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Well ma'am we can't help them if they don't call in, as we would need to speak with them to confirm an issues and provide assistance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: Okay, well I'm having the same issue.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay ma'am I can definitely help *you* with this issue but the others will still need to call in.

She I guess ignores the last part and just remotes me in, and she did not seem to be affected by the issue she was describing.

&gt;Me: Alright, so unfortunately I'm not seeing the issue you are referring to on your device so there isn't much I can do for you. If you could have those other employees call in we can get them sorted out though.  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: I don't think you understand I was on hold for 30 minutes before I got someone on the line, so they'll have to wait too.

A bit more info to help the story, this was on a Monday and it was fairly busy. There were 30 calls waiting and more kept piling on so we had to bust out those calls before we could do callbacks.

&gt;Me: So we have quite a few calls waiting, I can't guarantee when I'll be able to get to calling them back.  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: Sir you don't understand I had to wait for 30 minutes, what if they call in and have to wait an hour that would kill their productivity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Ma'am again we have quite a few calls in our queue, and more keep adding. Depending on how long this keeps up I might not even be able to get to the call backs today. I am very sorry for this tho--  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: No they will not be calling in, cause if they do they'll probably be waiting for awhile before anyone calls them back.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Yes but if you have me call them back, there is no guarantee when they'll get a call back. But if they call in they can reserve a spot in the queue and be assisted sooner.

At this point she went silent and I thought I had finally gotten her to see the that she was being an idiot. Nope, not even close.

&gt;Karen: You know I've worked for a lot of companies in my years and dealt with quite a few different help desks, but none of them have fought me as much as you have.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Again ma'a--  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: \*mockingly\* *ma'am,* I need you to call these people back so they can do their jobs!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I never said I wouldn't call them back, I just said I don't know when I would have time to call them back. It would be quicker for them to call in.

Then she asked my favorite question.

&gt;Karen: So you're not going to help me?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: You don't have an issue I can assist you with.  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: Yes I do, I have some employees who are having problems.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Once again ma'am I would recommend you have them call in for assitance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Karen: You know what never mind, I'll talk to someone higher up in IT and they'll help me since you won't.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Okay, well thank you for contacting the \[insert company name here\] help desk, *have a WONDERFUL day!*

I then closed out the ticket and put in there that the user had no issue and that she was calling on behalf of other users, and I informed her to have them call in but she refused. She didn't seem to like that but users can't reopen our tickets so the only thing she could do was leave a note that ""her"" issue wasn't resolved.

That's really it for the story I hope you all enjoy reading it.

Edit: To clarify something the issue she called about was three employees at her site had some network drives disappear and needed them remapped. Not really a serious issue but she did treat it like the end of the world.",396,0,1
Fill in a form? I've never had to do that before!!!,"I was reminded of this the other day by some random chat by the guy on local radio who also spells his name this way. so thought I'd share.  


Years ago working on 1st line at an MSP I got a call from one of our frequent flyers. lets call him Mr Shouty. I think he was a car salesman and apparently good mates with one of our company directors... you know the type I'm sure.  
The call went something like this...

Me: Good morning Company Na...

Mr Shouty: (Cuts me off) Hi it Shouty, I've got a new member of staff I need to get them an email address

Me: Oh hi Shouty, how are you? That's no problem. I'll email you across our account request form. If you can fill in the details and send it back to me I can get that done in a few minutes.

Mr Shouty: Form? what form? is that new?

Me: No its been standard since i started here, so thats over a year at least.

Mr Shouty: I've never had to do that in the 7 (8/9/10 however-many) years I've been a customer I'm not starting now.

Me:(Rolling eyes while logging into his AD). Ok chief (calling people chief was one of his things) this time, but in future send us the form ok? Right whats the name.

Mr Shouty: I'ts Gary...

I used to work with a guy who spelt Garry with double R and was always having to spell it to people, so I stop him to ask...  
Me: Ok is that Gary with one R or two?

Mr Shouty:WHAT KIND OF F\*\*\*\*G IDOT SPELLS GARY WITH 2 R's!!

Another voice in the background on the phone: Umm actually....

Mr Shouty:Ok send me the form... (Hangs up)

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe not exactly tech but its one of those calls that still gets a laugh whenever I get the shouty types on the phone. thankfully I'm not 1st line any more so I get a lot less of them",1534,0,1
What do you mean they're gone?,"Teams message from a user who previously worked for us, quit, then came back last week and has been a perpetual thorn in my side since then.

Oh great, you're not really going to ask that are you?

""Where would they be backed up to? I had a lot of files and that info would be super helpful""

me: yeah, we don't do that.

"We're going to send you a new printer rather than replacing the cheaper consumable. Also, printer companies are shady.","**Update** Printer company may not be as shady as suspected. See edit at the bottom for more info.

------------------

I work IT for a small company. It's a little stressful being the sole support person but our employees are easy to work with and understand that it's just me trying to solve their IT problems. Far better than the call center support jobs I've had before.

About a month ago our shipping department submitted a ticket for their printer, which was producing pages with large faded splotches. Shipping is, by far, our heaviest printer users and this printer had been in use for some time so I wasn't surprised that this finally happened.

I brought them a temporary printer and took theirs back to the office for troubleshooting. After doing everything I could find online, I gave up and reached out to the printer company.

After an hour of chatting with them about the problem and doing deeper troubleshooting steps, like hand cleaning the drum and checking places in the printer, they decided that the printer was bad and that they would send me a new one under warranty.

Great! No more troubleshooting this, new printer, the shipping guys will be ecstatic! I'm still pretty sure it's just a drum issue but if they want to send me a new printer I'm not going to complain.

Printer shows up a few days later and I'm excited to get the printer out to the shipping guys so they can stop complaining about the less-feature-rich temporary printer. 

I open the box and go to load the toner cartridge and realize that there's no drum... I go ahead and throw in the old drum and it produced prints with the same problem as before. Clearly it's a drum issue.

I reach back out to the printer company they agreed that it was indeed a drum issue and we'd need to buy a new drum. I suggest that they just let me send the printer back and they send me a new drum instead but, they tell me that my warranty on consumables (like the drum) expired 3 days before I contacted them.

Ok... fine... you want to give us an expensive printer instead of a cheap drum? No problem. I go online and buy a third-party drum, get it the next day, put it in, BAM excellent quality prints!

The shipping guys are thrilled to have their printer back and thank me for taking care of it for them (nice warm fuzzys compared to being berated on the phone because a customer can't plug an ethernet cable into their computer).

Fast forward to two days ago, I get another ticket from the shipping guys saying the printer is starting to do the same thing and also has a ""replace drum"" error. I'm just flat out confused as to why a new drum would be having problems so soon and I can understand why the shipping guys are upset.

The prints aren't too bad yet so I ask them to keep using it while I look into the issue. I did, finally, realize that I had never reset the drum counter on the printer, so I sent them instructions to clear that while I kept looking into why the pages were coming out splotchy. 

A few minutes later I get a reply back saying that after clearing the ""replace drum"" error the prints were coming out beautifully again.

I shouldn't be shocked by this, but I am. It floored me to know that this printer company, a well known brand, would intentionally make their printers print poorly in order to get you to buy more of their consumables. I know about planned obsolescence, I know about DRM locks and ""genuine product"" checks, but this was something I never thought a company would do.

At any rate, the shipping guys are happy that their printer is good again, I'm happy that we got a free printer, and now I know that printer companies are even shadier than I ever imagined.

Bonus Story: Had a user complain their their laptop wouldn't recognize their thumb drive. I went to their desk and found the thumb drive in the ethernet port.

---------------

**Edit** /u/ClokworkPenguin commented below that printers change what voltage is applied depending on the age of the drum and that reseting the drum counter tells the hardware to go back to the ""new drum"" voltage which changes the quality of the print since it's the actual right voltage for it at the time. Excellent info!",454,0,1
There's no space!,"Obligatory not actually in tech support. Not far off though, I'm a software engineer. Anyways, I was helping my father copy some files around on his laptop when this took place. 

**Cast:** 

$Me = me.

$Dad = father, creator of me.

**The Tale:**

$Dad: Can you help me make 12 copies of this file?

$Me: Yea, but why? (*Quick sanity check*)

$Dad: One for each month. It's a form.

$Me: Yup. 

*Walking him through copy/pasting files. Showed him Ctrl+C and then Ctrl+V over and over to create new copies of the file. Blew his mind! Maximum son points earned.*

$Dad: (*Suddenly stops pasting at about 9 copies*) Is that all I can fit? Is it full?

$Me: What?

$Dad: The hard drive. Is it full? I've got no space, look.

$Me: You've got plenty... (*Realises what he means, start giggling to myself*)

He was using the details view for files in Windows File Explorer, so each pasted file went under the previous, taking up a line. The last file he pasted was right at the bottom of the window, almost touching it. He was asking if he ran out of hard drive space because it didn't look like another file would fit on screen underneath.

$Me: It's just a list of files, you'll just get a scroll bar, see. (*Pastes the rest of the copies and points out the scrollbar, and shows him how to see his disk capacity...*)

Gave me a good laugh. Bless him. 

Also, he asks me how to copy/paste about 3 times a week, and has been doing so for easily the last decade... :D",216,0,1
Congratulations! You are now IT/Tech Support!!,"So let me preface this story by explaining that I am a speech-language pathologist. A lot is involved in my line of work, so I won't go into much detail, but I will say that I work primarily with kids who have various speech and language disorders. I am not IT or Tech Support at all. 

You might be wondering why I am in this subreddit then, and that would be a very good question. I have been trying to figure that out myself, and if there was a starting point, it would be sometime in summer one year ago. I had been volunteering at my job before officially being hired and during that time, my colleagues realized that I was decent at using Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, etc. They soon started coming to me for answers about small issues they were having when working on assignments (like having awkward spacing because they would keep using the spacebar instead of the tab key to indent). By the time I was a full-time employee, I had found myself teaching them many things about Microsoft Office among other things.

Then, the pandemic happened this year and we were forced to work from home. This meant we had to use video/audio conferencing tools like Zoom. Problem was, we were not that well funded in general, so we had very little help from work with getting this done. I received a call from my supervisor that went something like this:

Supervisor: ""Good morning Ms. OP, I hope you are well. I need your help. I need you to create a Zoom account and help us set up a video conference for our team at a time I will message you later today.""

Me: ""Oh, uh okay ma'am. I'll have to take some time to read up on it and see how it works.""

Supervisor: ""I'm not worried at all! I know you can figure this out. You're techy like that. I'll message you again later. Thank you!""

Luckily for her, I had created an account already because my church was using the platform. Still, I had to learn how to set up a call. Reading up on it, I realized it was simple enough to do. The struggle came with getting my colleagues in the call.

I sent messages in our group chat followed by voice messages. Some were still confused, so I went out of my way to record a video and upload it so that they could watch how to 1) get to the website, 2) create an account, 3) log in, and 4) join a call. This is how the conversation went in a nutshell.

Supervisor: ""Good afternoon! I saw your video, but I still could use your help in case I've forgotten anything.""

Me: ""No problem ma'am.""

Supervisor: ""Thank you! Now...how do I get on to Zoom again?""

Me: ""Just type zoom dot com in the address bar.""

Supervisor: ""Uh-huh...and how do I create an account again?""

Me: (wondering if she really read/listened to ANY of my messages, or watched the video...) Look for the orange button in the top right corner with the words ""sign up, it's free"" in white font.

Supervisor: (A few minutes later) ""It says that an account is already associated with this email address.""

Me: ""Sounds like you had already signed up earlier.""

Supervisor: ""I did after watching your video.""

Me: (wondering WHY she didn't tell me this from the get-go...) ""Oh! Then, you don't need to click on sign up. You need to click on 'sign-in'. The words are in blue and are next to the 'sign up' button"".

This conversation continued with questions on how to join the call and then how to invite people to the call. Guys...it took my supervisor over 45 minutes to invite 3 other people to the call. And when she did, I then had to show them how to create accounts and login too! At the time, I only had the free version, so the call timed out and I had to get everyone back into the call AGAIN. Cue another 45 minutes trying to get them to remember what I literally just taught them, even though all they had to do was click on a link sent to their inboxes. In short, what was supposed to be a 40-minute long meeting took like 3 hours!

I wish I could say that was the end of it, but oh no... The level of support I gave progressed to church as well. I started hosting Sabbath School classes (which was fine) and learned that the 40 minutes I received on the free account simply wouldn't cut it. So...I ended up paying for it. A good investment in the long run, but I was definitely annoyed at the time. My boyfriend joked that I was becoming tech support for my team.

Soon, I started inviting our Sabbath School teachers so that they could teach lessons at their designated times. But many of them were older and intimidated by the new technology. Here came OP to the rescue, calling them over the phone to walk them through joining a call and sharing their screen. One lady couldn't get her audio or video to work at all on her phone and I figured out that the camera and mic were not being allowed access on her device. OP to the rescue yet again, calling the husband's phone so that I could walk his wife through how to allow the camera and mic access on the app on her phone.

I have learned how to ask people which device they were using, whether they were using wifi or ethernet cable (always recommended ethernet when I heard they had one cause our internet quality isn't the best in our country...not the US btw), and if they had documents they needed to share. I learned how to disable annotation tools when kids learned how to doodle on screens while teachers were trying to teach. I even started recording the lessons and uploading them to YouTube for church members to watch at a later time if they wanted to. My life these last few months has basically become Zoom. Guys...I am Zoomed out.

Just earlier this week, I vented to my boyfriend online about a conversation I had with an employee who could not get on to a video conference (""Yes, ma'am. I understand that you did see the email sent to you this morning but did you click on the link that allows you to enter the meeting?""). I had a day where I hosted a series of meetings for literal hours only to return home and have to show my dad how to log into his account and join a call.

My boyfriend listened quietly, but his facial expressions said it all. ""So...welcome to IT, babe! How does it feel?"" And we both laughed because it was SO TRUE!!!

Seriously, in the span of a few months, I became this IT/Tech Support hybrid. And I don't see it stopping anytime soon. I am now part of a major committee for our job (sorry, can't say more than that), and we are going to be meeting for at least the next two months...may God help me.",168,0,1
This is a business-critical issue that is affecting productivity across the whole site.,"I was reminded of one recently:

I swung by an office to drop off a laptop and do new employee orientation. It took way longer than expected, so I was dialing into my next meeting on the way out the door. 

The new site lead (mid-manger, small site) caught me and said:

&gt; $manager: Oh hey, I have this issue that I need to take a look at!

&gt; $me: I'm sorry, I'm way behind - can you put in a ticket and we'll prioritize?

&gt; $manager: This is a business critical issue that is affecting work performance for the whole site. It's a top-level priority.

&gt; $me: Ok, then you *absolutely* need to call the mission control hotline. If I can help you with it, they'll put it on my calendar, but then I'll have a WO and the budget to fix it.

&gt; $manager: No, I need this taken care of right now.

&gt; $me: *sigh* What is going on?

&gt; $manager: Well. We had a thunderstorm around 2pm yesterday, and the power cut out for the whole building and no one was able to work.

&gt; $me: But the server was still up, right? And the emergency lighting?

&gt; $manager: Well, the lights came on, and I think I still heard noise in the server room. But there was NO POWER! Don't you think it's *pretty important* that we have power to do our jobs?

&gt; $me: Wait, how long did it last?

&gt; $Manager: about 5, maybe 10 minutes.

After swearing that I would look into a ""huge battery or something"", I got out of the building.

It turns out 

1) EVERYONE at the site works from laptops - so everyone could've simply undocked their laptops and continued work, since

2) the servers and infrastructure *are* powered by a ""huge battery"" - and a large diesel generator to back it up, which actually spun up within 45 seconds of the power outage and brought all power to the building back on, and

3) Almost all workstations have UPSes installed anyway - but Site Manager didn't have one in his new cube. When asked why:

""Well, I didn't know what it was. I tried to carry it to my new desk, but it was SUPER heavy and beeped when I was holding it. So I figured it had a GPS tracker that knew I was moving, it so I put it back.""

"Don't check email when on holiday / staycation, unless you want a reminder of why you are having a rest.","Just checked my email and a user has raised a ticket.

They had gone into a remote office and were having trouble printing.

The central print server is at the main office, about 750m away from the remote office and connected by a dedicated point-to-point wireless link, so all data from the remote office goes down the link.

They then raise a second ticket reporting that the VOIP phones are only working intermittently...

Looks like we need to get the tree surgeon in again to trim two of the ""protected"" trees on our property that have grown in the the wireless path, as happens about every 3 years...

tl;dr- I'm trying to close out audit findings. The audit was written by a conspiracy theorist and there's a pile of vaporware in the center of Large Client.   
  
Or as I like to call it, Thursday with Ian.  
  
I'm waiting for go-aheads for a few issues, so I'm going to start picking at random from the voluminous report.  
  
I start at the beginning and scroll through quickly without reading.  
  
No whammies  
  
No whammies  
  
*Finding 30*. Insecure systems for cloud storage. Seems straightforward. Someone did the usual. World readable blob/bucket. That happens.   
  
But not for the author of the report, who riffs for a paragraph about how difficult it is to secure the cloud. I'd like to let them know that useful things are often dangerous.   
  
Wait a minute, I can. I can go through this audit report with Ian and pick out the findings worth discussing. I'll be filtering out the crazy.   
  
This, of course is going to require a conversation with Ian. A long one. This will be painful, but I am an organic pain collector trundling towards my eventual destruction.  
  
I'm about to go find Ian when I get a meeting request from Harold, the Product Manager who hired me. I accept without looking. It's for later today, so I don't have to think about it  yet.  
  
I walk over to Ian's cubicle. He's there, staring at a screen.  
  
me:""Hi there, Ian. I've been reading your report and I have a few questions. Can you help me?""  
  
Ian:""Why don't people like me?""  sme
  
It looks like I'm going to have to fix Ian's problems before he fixes mine.   
  
me:""Well, uh, you sometimes make it hard to like you. You treat other people like objects""  
  
Ian:""...""  
  
I don't think Ian wanted my honest opinion.  
  
me:""Well, can you help me understand some of these audit findings? I'm looking for context here""  
  
Ian puts his headphones on and proceeds to ignore me.  
  
Fine. I'm going to do this the hard way. On my way back, I see Aarush, the head of the Potemkin Village with blockchain project called the Vault. He wants my attention. Great.  
  
Aarush:""Hey, bro. Think you can make some progress on some open items?""  
  
me:""How far are you from go-live?""  
  
Aarush:""Well, that's why you're here. We need to resolve some security issues. The Senior Vice President wants to show the Vault off""  
  
I lean in and whisper:""I doubt it. From that demo, there's very little behind the scenes""  
  
Aarush(looking shocked):""No, no. There's a lot of engineering you didn't see""  
  
me:""Look. I'm not trying to get you in trouble. I'm happy you found something to do with Ian so he doesn't get in trouble. Some day I'd like that option""  
  
Aarush:""But I'd like to have you on this project so we can make it work.""  

me:""You think more of my skills than I do. I get it. Lots of people want to put block-chain on their resume and leave before it blows up or gets cancelled. You're playing a more complicated game for bigger stakes. Let me be a simple gumshoe and I'll ignore comings and goings around the reservoir""  
  
Aarush looks puzzled. Perhaps he's not a Roman Polanski fan.  
  

me:""I'll talk to Harold, tell him it's not a good fit and we go our separate ways. If not, I'll draft a report like Ian about how your project is expensive vaporware.""  
  
Aarush puts up his hands. I stop talking and walk back to my cubicle.  
  
I manage to check the configurations on the cloud storage referenced in Finding 30 and note that they've been resolved. Another one off the list. I spend more time building a tracking spreadsheet for my findings and recommendations.   
  
It's time for my meeting with Harold, so I make my way to his office. Before we get going, he conferences in $Trusted_Recruiter, who got me this contract gig in the first place.  
  
Now I'm suspicious.  
  
Harold:""Thanks for taking the time to meet with me. I have some concerns about this project""  
  
me:""Oh?""  
  
Harold:""I think you're focusing on the wrong things. Your plan to disable systems to find their owners has political effects""  
  
me:""In the absence of a good inventory list, that's all you have""  
  
Harold:""And you think that's the most pressing issue?""  
  
me:""It's a concern. Abandoned systems don't get patched or monitored. Since they're on your networks, you trust them""  
  
Harold (getting impatient):""And yet you don't think the Vault is more important?""  
  
me:""I don't see the Vault fixing that problem in a reasonable timeframe. You have some things to cross off while you're waiting""  
  
Harold:""I disagree. I think it's time to re-evaluate this relationship. We'll offer you two week's pay and you can offboard today""  
  
$Trusted_Recruiter:""That's more than fair""  
  
me:""I agree. I'll drop off my equipment and be on my way""  
  
Harold:""Thank you for taking this like an adult. It's good to know you're a professional""  
  
I smile at the odd compliment and walk out, somewhat relieved.  
  
At my cubicle, I shove my personal laptop into my shoulder bag. I put on my leather jacket and bag and carry my helmet and the LargeClient nylon laptop bag (empty) towards the equpment depot in the basement.   
  
I'm debating between explaining why the bag is empty or just dropping it off and running. Luckily in the mess down there, I notice a pile of old equipment against one of the scabby Doom colored cubicle walls. There are a few obsolete Dell Inspirons with the stupid media controls below the trackpad buttons. I shove one into the laptop bag and wait in line as LC employees and contractors pick up or drop off equipment.  
  
There is a chipper young man at the counter who takes my bag after looking at my ID. He opens the bag, finds the old, surplus Dell and nods appreciatively.  
  
Chipper:""Wow. You must have had this a long time""  
  
me:""It's always worked for me""  
  
Chipper smiles and puts the bag on the beaten up library cart.  
  
I kept the ID from LC as a trophy. I did have to buy a few rounds of drinks to explain to $Trusted_Recruiter that it wasn't really anybody's fault. Occasionally LC HR will email or call, offering full time roles. I turn them down. They never did roll the Vault, but Aarush did find himself a new job. Ian's freelancing now. When I see him at conferences, I pull off the ""We're hiring"" ribbon on my badge.   
  
Forget it, Jake, this is IT freelancing.",1913,1,1
The one time I went Darth Vader on someone,"My first XXXL post!  TLDR at the bottom.  (I'm relatively new to reddit, so apologies if there's formatting or other issues that are newbie mistakes)

In the early 90's  I worked at a major aerospace company that doesn't exist any more.  Our division employed about seven thousand people, with about 4,000 PCs running MS-DOS, spread out over a campus with multiple buildings, and me and six other people in the fledgling IT department introducing everyone to the joys of email.  As a NASA/DoD contractor all employees had to wear badges prominently displayed at all times (this comes up later).

As we handed out mail accounts, we setup the usernames mostly as &lt;lastname&gt;&lt;first\_initial&gt; and with the initial password set to some variation of ""passwordNN"" and required people to change it to an actual password as part of the initial login process.   Did I mention this was the 90's?  Before the widespread internet?  Before GMAIL?  Before ANY real standards?  That's my excuse - we knew no better.  But our system mostly worked and all seemed well.

Until we started getting complaints that the executives were having trouble logging in to their email accounts.  The passwords were getting changed alright, but not by the legitimate users.  It wasn't tough to reset their passwords and get them up and running, but something weird was going on.

I won't go into unnecessary details, but the front-end to this email system was a batch file - remember those?  So I modified it to log the username being accessed on each login, and pushed it out to all the division PCs.  A few days later we spotted one PC, after hours, that was trying to access multiple executive accounts over and over.

So I modified the batch file again.  This time it logged the username AND the PC's MAC address.  All the PCs were listed in a division asset database, along with which common area or office they were placed in, so I could use the MAC address to physically locate where the PC sat.  And I set up a watchdog program to scan the log file and BEEP whenever anyone attempted a login to any of the executives' accounts.

The next day I was working late (as usual) and chatting with a friend and fellow employee when my PC started BEEPing at me.  It was my watchdog, and it only took me a minute to cross reference the MAC address to another building on the campus.  I explained what was going on to my friend and that I needed to get to the other building as fast as possible.  He offered to drive me over because he had scored a great parking spot very close to my office.  We ran to his car, raced to the other building, got through security, and started to look for the PC who's asset tag number I had written down.

The company didn't really believe in giving most people offices, so tech teams were in these semi-open bays.  A please-nobody compromise between offices and an open floor plan.  As I approached the bay that the asset database had said the PC was in, I saw one employee making notes on a piece of paper as he repeatedly typed on the keyboard.  This was around 6:30 at night, and most people left around 5:00 so there really was no chance of confusion.  I took a seat across from the dude, who (as I approached) tried to hide a piece of paper that I could see had a list of executive names on it.  Conversation went like this:

ME  (me),  MF  (my friend who drove me there),  PN  (Panicky Nerd)

Me:  Hi  &lt;reading his name tag&gt; .  I'm Terry.  Maybe you know me from the IT newsletter? 

PN:  Hi?

I started to get up, because I got his name which was what I was after.  But something kicked in and I sat back down and in a very quiet, very matter-of-fact tone, continued:

Me:  I would just like to clear up a few things.  Did you know that accessing computer accounts that aren't your own is a firing offense?

PN:  (His eyes widened a little) No.

Me:  Did you know that from IT we can monitor and track all PC activity?  \[A fib, but close enough\]

PN:  (looking down, not even meeting my eyes) No.

Me:  (Super slowly and quietly) Am I EVER going to have to come over here and explain this to you again?

PN:  (Very quietly and still not meeting my eyes) No.

Me:  Glad we could have this little chat &lt;his name&gt;.

As my friend and I walked away, I was vibrating from the adrenaline.

MF: Damn, you went all Darth Vader on his ass.

Me: What?

MF: That was freaking intense.  &gt;I&lt; was scared of you and I didn't anything wrong.

I laughed, but apparently MF was right, because when I got in to work the next morning the IT Director called me into his office where PN and PN's manager were sitting.  Before leaving the night before I had written up what had happened and emailed it to everyone in the department, to let them know we wouldn't have to worry about any more executives getting locked out of email.  While it was certainly true that what he did was A Bad Thing, and company policy said it could be grounds for termination, I had absolutely no say in what was going to happen to him.  I'm just a techie; the next steps were up to management.  I assumed some sort of reprimand would be issued.

The director had called me in so that PN could apologize for his actions, and promise it wouldn't happen again.  I was already in a good mood (hey, I had caught the Email Bandit!) and was happy to tell him I held no grudge.  Frankly, PN looked like shit -- like he'd been up all night.  I felt sorry for him, more than anything else.   I found out later that PN was so traumatized by our talk that he had called up his boss right after we left, on the verge of tears, confessed everything, and begged not to be fired.  His boss told him we would sort things out the next day.

My take away - you don't have to shout to have an impact.  And sometimes you just have to go all Darth Vader on someone.

TLDR:  an employee hacked some executive email passwords, got caught, and was spooked into turning away from the Dark Side.",189,0,1
Reboot to the head!,"Waaay back when XP was new, it had a memory leak problem that, if it wasn't rebooted every 90 days at minimum, it would slow to a crawl and get flakier than Tony the Tiger's dandruff. Generally, XP would BSOD every so often anyway, so it wasn't a real problem.

How a Russian Agency saved an American Life,"First time posting. On mobile so forgive my mistakes. 

Back in 2012, I used to work for a 3rd party call center that closed down for whatever reason. Used to have the name of a certain three letter foreign agency making some of our calls interesting as we did customer service for phone lines. I had been having a slow day when I suddenly got an irate woman yelling into my ears. It caught me so off guard I jumped and threw my headset. Also found out that call had been picked as a random listen in as my supervisor reacted exactly the same way and notified me to answer but add him in. 

It took about 20 minutes of trying to de-escalate the call to finally find out the issue. A woman in her late seventies had been trying to get her phone line fixed properly and it had not been working at all since installation 5 months prior. I continued running through the very basic troubleshooting before attempting to make an appointment for a technician to visit. Unfortunately this was just after Hurricane Sandy so many of our techs were assisting first responders in her area. 

She broke down crying and through the sobs notified me of something that was never marked in her account, her phone line was exclusively for LifeAlert. As soon as I heard that, I dug deep into her account with help from the billing side of the house. Found out her original agent marked it as a note on the sale account but not as specifically Medically necessary. This one mark could have cost a life. With the help of my supervisor, we updated her account and credited it for two months. She was happy to get money but preferred service that worked. Staying on the line with a tech supervisor in New York, we got an emergency tech to fully inspect the line at no cost to her only to find out exactly what happened. The first tech connected her line to the wrong apartment. Once it was fixed and she was told, she cried again this time happily. 

Fast forward two weeks later, got called into HR. Got told I was being put on a final alert for termination for taking too long with the call. My supervisor was told he was wrong to tell me to help and I should have hung up as soon as she began yelling at me. I put in my two weeks notice on the spot. 

Final part: About two months after I quit, my old supervisor called me. Turns out not long after the line in that particular customer's home was fixed she had a mild heart attack and fell hitting her head. She was able to use her LifeAlert before losing consciousness. She made a full recovery in the hospital. Her daughter had called in and asked to thank me if possible. It made me happy to know I helped make a difference even a small one in a stranger's life. Sorry if it ran long. Just popped in my head after reading.

Edit: Thanks for all the support. This exploded more than I expected it would. I've seen many comments asking why call length was an issue for tech support. At that job they only cared about two things: short calls less than 3 minutes and 5 star after call reviews. Not having either was grounds for dismissal. Worst of all, while I did put in my two weeks notice, they let me go early because they changed my schedule when I had already applied for a particular day off months in advance. Failure to arrive being the third strike they needed since the main two objectives qualified as two strikes.",1533,1,1
"The printer is ""broken""","Years ago, my family had a printer where the paper went vertically into the top instead of in a drawer. The printer was on a small table below the desk. 

One day, I try to send something to it, I go downstairs to get it and.... nothing has come out. The paper light is blinking red (I think blinking meant jam and solid meant no paper detected) but I don't see a sheet partway down in the stack. I open up the printer's main cover. Nothing looks amiss, so I close it again. It tries to start, makes mostly normal sounds with a slightly louder click than usual, here and there. But the paper hasn't moved an inch and it says paper jam again. 

Weird. I unplug the printer, make sure the paper guides are in the right position, take the paper stack out, and when I put it in, I tap the stack down a bit and plug the power back in. It seems to start up okay. But the same stuff happens when I try to actually print! 

Oh darn. Has the printer become a brick already? It isn't that old, and we didn't see any real signs of impending failure. I go grab a flashlight to take a closer look at the innards, in hopes of seeing something that's easy to fix at home. 

Okay, the wheels in the printer go round and round..... sorry. The wheels on the left side look like they're okay. Same in the middle. And the pen on the right side looks like it's fine, too. Wait, what? The pen? What the FSCK is a pen doing in the printer? Well, okay. I pulled the plug and fished the pen out of the printer. Everything else looks okay, now that there isn't a foreign object inside. Well, hopefully. Let's try and do a test print.

Sure enough, it works fine after that. 

How did the pen get in there? Well, remember how the printer was below the desk? Well, it turns out our cat likes to push small items around the desk, and the paper slot was in exactly the wrong place so that the pen could fall into it if it fell off the desk. It landed flat inside the printer so I couldn't see it unless I actually looked down directly into it. 

We are lucky that the mechanics and the motor survived having the pen caught in the paper tray.",220,0,1

Monday

**Network Operations:** We've received an alert that switch ADDRESS04TAS03B-2 in IDF04N cannot be reached. Please check connection.

**Network Cabling:** I'm in IDF04N and ADDRESS04TAS03B-2 is online and working as intended. Fiber on Port 51 is amber though.

**Network Operations**: Okay, could you reseat it?

**Network Cabling:** Done. Still amber.

**Network Operations:** Where does it lead?

**Network Cabling:** To a cross connect to the datacenter. Reseated the other end too.

**Network Operations:** Has there been any work done to this switch recently?

**Network Cabling:** Not in four months for obvious reasons.

**Network Operations:** Okay. Can you connect the console?

**Network Cabling:** Moving the console from ADDRESS04TAS05B.

**Network Operations:** Okay, thanks. Give the ticket back to us.

**Network Cabling:** Done.

Tuesday

**Network Operations:** Giving the ticket back to you. We would like you to check out Port 48 on ADDRESS04TAS03B2 as this shows as down.

**Network Cabling:** Okay. What's the hotline so I can troubleshoot this with you in realtime?

**Network Operations:** \*11 digit number\*

**Network Cabling:** \*Ring\*

**Network Operations Hotline (Florida):** Hi, how can I help you?

**Network Cabling:** I have ticket INC########## and I would like to work with Network Operations to fix this without playing email tag.

**Network Operations Hotline (Florida):** Okay, let me patch you to an engineer.

**Network Operations Hotline (New Jersey):** You have reached the Network Operations Hotline. If you would like to leave a messa- \*click\*

**Network Cabling:** \*Ring\*

**Network Operations Hotline (Florida):** Hi, how can I help you?

**Network Cabling:** I just called but you transferred me to a voicemail box.

**Network Cabling:** What's the number you have for me?

**Network Operations Hotline (Florida):** \*13 digit number\*

**Network Cabling:** That's too many numbers. Lop off the first two.

**Network Operations Hotline (Florida):** Okay.

**Network Operations:** \*Ring\*

**Network Cabling:** Hi.

**Network Operations:** Oh good, we've been trying to reach you.

**Network Cabling:** I'll bet. Port 48 is up, green link light. Where is this supposed to go?

**Network Operations:** It's supposed to go to ADDRESS04TAS03B port 44.

**Network Cabling:** That's weird. That switch is six inches away from it but the cable runs all the way to a cross connect patch panel.

**Network Operations:** Odd. Where does ADDRESS04TAS03B2 port 48 go?

**Network Cabling:** It goes to a patch panel labeled SEC Port 3. I don't know where that corresponds to.

**Network Operations:** And it is live?

**Network Cabling:** Yep.

**Network Operations:** Okay. It shows to us as down. And where does ADDRESS04TAS03B port 44 go?

**Network Cabling:** It goes to a patch panel that was originally intended for a switch that no longer exists but has since been renamed so many times I'll need a toner to figure it out. It's also live, though.

**Network Operations:** Curious. And ADDRESS04TAS03B is in RACK###, UH21?

**Network Cabling:** Yes it is. And ADDRESS04TAS03B-2 is in the same rack, UH19.

**Network Operations:** That is odd. It still shows as down.

**Network Cabling:** Just so we're on the same page, for ADDRESS04TAS03B-2, is the serial SERIALH1N0?

**Network Operations:** Give me a moment. No, it should be serial SERIALW16P.

**Network Cabling:** There's no switch in this IDF with that serial. Let me check IDF04S. Nope. No switch there with that serial, either.

**Network Operations:** Interesting. Our system has it listed as at desk 04E05.

**Network Cabling:** Why would a switch be at an end user's desk?

**Network Operations:** That's just what we have.

**Network Cabling:** Oooookay. I went by that desk and it's empty, as is the whole row.

**Network Operations:** That's disconcerting. Can you look it up in the asset inventory database?

**Network Cabling:** Sure. Nope, no records. Even doing SERIALW only brings up one decommissioned switch that hasn't yet been thrown out. Maybe it was removed at one point? Like, is SERIALH1N0 its replacement?

**Network Operations:** I don't know. Calling Network Deployment.

**Network Deployment:** Hi, how can I help you?

**Network Cabling:** We can't find SERIALW16P, hostname ADDRESS04TAS03B-2.

**Network Deployment:** SERIALW16P? That's a lab switch.

**Network Cabling:** Huh? I'm looking at a production switch.

**Network Deployment:** Nope. Lab switch. It's supposed to be connected to ADDRESS04TAS03B 2/0/44.

**Network Cabling:** Did you say ""2/0/44""?

**Network Deployment:** Yep. Goes to ADDRESS04TAS03B2 1/0/48.

**Network Cabling:** I think I know the problem now.

**Network Operations:** What is the problem?

**Network Cabling:** We did a restack last weekend, but Desktop Support never adds themselves to the restack because they like to move their own stuff. Let me go find a desktop guy.

**Network Operations:** Okay. Any luck?

**Network Cabling:** They've all gone home for the day but I found their new digs, plus switch: ADDRESS04TAS03B2. Which is unplugged and turned off. Y'know, we really ought to be labeling these things better.",252,0,1
When a user is committed to prolonging their own misery.,"This would be impressive levels of mental gymnastics if I weren't so disappointed.

One of our ""favorite"" clients is someone I'll call Useless. She can only comprehend perhaps 10% of what's going on around her or in her life at any given moment, and also can't write. And yet somehow she is the owner of a software package with us, with several other users under her employ.

So the other day, I went to scroll through our ticket queue while I waited for the coffee to activate the ""caring"" parts of my brain. I see one or two tickets further back in the queue from Useless. These tickets consisted, more or less, of the following:

&gt;can I even this as decided to WEBSITE use even go want to do look more like HELP CALL ME XXX-XXX-XXXX not programmer PAYING FOR THIS iS RIDICulouS

So I look back at Useless's record and see that she's submitted several similar cases that coworkers have already picked up over the course of a couple of weeks. Useless, as I neglected to mention, is one of those whose parents were violently murdered in the Great Email Slaughter of 1969 and actively refuses to respond or communicate through email. You email her back, she just responds with more ""I drank rocket fuel and decided to type"" with a ""CALL ME"" at the end.

We do take inbound calls as tech support, but if someone just submits a case with some vague ""call me"" bullshit, we respond to you via email letting you know our number, our hours, and also to let us know the best time to call if they were so insistent that we call them.

Coworkers had done this with Useless, based on her account history. Repeatedly. Called her when she responded back asking for it. Somehow she was never at the phone.

They emailed her back asking for a time to call and practically begging her to explain what she needed. She just demanded a call and refused to give a time where she could be reached. Rinse and repeat until people just started closing out her tickets without replying anymore.

We'd made the necessary checks to make sure her site wasn't down and her software was functional. But if she couldn't tell us wtf she wanted, she could continue screaming into the void.

A little later that day, there was a critical priority case in the queue from Useless, which I grabbed. Paraphrased:

&gt;""MY SITE IS DOWN, WROTE WEEKS AGO, NO HELP NO CALL, LAZY TECHS. nEeEDED YOUR HELP DID IT MYSELF LAZY LAZY""

""Site down"" is a phrase I actually recognized, so I went to give her a call.

For some brief context, software package comes with a website that we provide and let you customize (VERY limited). We even let you redirect your private domain to it. The only thing we ask you not to do is mask our domain because it breaks shit. Specifically, makes the mobile version of your website not work.

As you can guess, Useless did this.

Turns out, not only is Useless capable of articulating human speech on the phone, but she is also somehow reachable when her business is jeopardized. Who knew.

Basically, as she explained (read: screeched), all her email to us were her supposedly ASKING us how to mask our domain so she could use hers. And also remove our branding. And since she ""couldn't get a response"", she did it herself anyway. Which resulted in a bunch of shit no longer functioning properly including the mobile site.

I listened, then explained to her that the answer was no to both of her requests for various reasons, and that if she wanted shit to work again, she needed to get rid of the masking. Surprisingly, she was mostly just grumpy about those answers. But when she asked why no one had responded to her or called her, and I told her why? *She was out for blood.*

&gt;**Useless:** So, why is it that when I put in a ticket nobody calls me? I don't contact you guys just to get a stupid email, I want you to properly communicate with me by phone! I don't read emails, it's rude to send an email when I ask for a call. Now my site's down because no one bothered to call until today!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** I'm sorry if our attempts to call you back didn't get through. Just taking a quick look here at our logs this past week, it looks like Hannah tried to reach you on \[Dates and Times\], Josh attempted on \[Dates and Times\], and so did Kevin on \[Dates and Times\]. And it looks like there were a few more attempts yesterday from Ginger at \[Times\]. We all tried to reach you at XXX.XXX.XXXX. Is that the correct number to reach you?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Useless:** Of course it is, that's my cell phone!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me:** Well, according to our call logs, we did try to reach you a number of times, and we simply emailed you as an alternative since you weren't able to be reached by phone. It looks like we couldn't quite determine what you were wanting to do based on your emails, so we tried to see if it'd be easier to help you out over the phone. If you're not able to come to the phone, it's generally best to either let us know what you'd like via email, or let us know of a time you'll be available so we can call you then.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Useless:** EXCUSE ME? THE ONLY REASON YOU FOLKS COULDN'T READ MY EMAILS IS BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET YOUR NUMBERS UP, YOU DON'T CARE WHAT'S ON THE EMAIL, YOU'LL JUST FIRE OFF ONE OF YOUR ROBOT REPLIES. WHEN I SAY I WANT A CALL, I WANT A CALL, YOU ARE *NOT* TO SEND ME EMAILS ANYMORE, AND YOU ARE TO CALL ME *IMMEDIATELY* WHEN I ASK FOR IT. MY WEBSITE IS DOWN BECAUSE OF YOU AND *YOU* WILL FIX IT.

There was some more, but it can basically just be boiled down to ""Karenspeak"". I just sighed and cracked open the escalation form while she bitched some more.

From what I understand, Useless was just as psycho with our managers, which means she goes to our head of client relations to be given an even sterner talking to where failure to be less Karen might mean we fire her as a customer.

Her domain is still masked as of today.

TL;DR: Karen who hates emails breaks her own site and blames us.",368,0,1
Do you have any tape I can use?,"     “Error: print head lifted” 

I was greeted with this error when opening the webinterface of a faulty labelprinter. 2 months had passed since my $Team had given this ticket to $DummieTeam to check the labelprinter locally. 2 entire months of time to walk to production, check what is going on and solve this issue. An entire epidemic had infected the globe in less, yet here we were still waiting for a fix. $DummieTeam had finally prepared a spare printer and had asked me to make sure the settings were up to standards before they would swap it out. I was not involved until now, but I always look further than what is being asked. Naturally I’d cast a glance at the ongoing issue myself before I would give my verdict.

&gt; “Really?” I thought for myself. “That doesn’t seem too hard to fix”. 

I started reading the related ticket and mailchain to get to the bottom of this conundrum.

2 months of having to miss this printer had made quite an impact on that production line. They were pissed off; and rightfully so. Escalations had happened multiple times, managers and above were…displeased... certainly now that it had come to the point where they had to manually write their labels and an external inspection coming up in the following days. This issue was visible across the board and there would be repercussions, regardless of the outcome.

Scrolling back in time through the ticket I see the person who went to see the printer himself.

&gt; ""Oh no"" I exclaimed

I had dealt with $Brick before, and my verdict of him was already set in stone. $Brick had the troubleshooting talent and intelligence equivalent of a brick, hence the name. According to his analysis in the ticket, the labelprinter would still give the error, regardless of the position of the printhead. I rejected his observation without a second thought and said to $Dummieteam: 

&gt; “Firstly, you have prepared the wrong type of labelprinter, you need $Correcttype. Secondly, I’m going to see for myself first.

Off I went to the production area, hoisting myself into a sterile outfit and covering everything from my toes to the crown of my head to prevent contamination. I arrived at the scene and was met with less than friendly faces. They changed expressions however when I stated I was from $Team, not $DummieTeam, and came to check the printer. The culprit was located on top of an Electricity box. I am not a small man, but there was no way I could reach that high comfortably. I disconnected the printer and installed it on top of the only available surface: a barrel with unknown contents. I went to work on the patient while it was balancing on top of its temporary home. While crouching, to get on eye level with the culprit, the single use jumpsuit I was wearing tore from groin to knees. 3 hurrahs for quality control. I embraced my new AC hole with a shrug and started troubleshooting. After a while a thought popped in my head:

&gt; “Peculiar, most peculiar”

I hate to admit it, but the diagnosis of $Brick was correct. The printer would stall regardless of the position of the print head lever. I looked closer at the mechanism. In an ideal world the printhead in a locked position would push in a small button by means of a pin, signalling that everyone was good to go. I put the printhead in said locked position but it did not seem to register. I stated with a grin:

&gt; “We need to go deeper” 

Hoping a split second later that the operators would not have heard. I applied pressure on the lever in a way that the pin would go in deeper, assuming that it would apply the pressure needed to the small button. My attempt paid off: the printer led lights turned green and 2 months worth of labels stuck in the queue started rolling out. I stood there for a solid 10 minutes, keeping pressure on the lever, afraid it would stop the moment I would loosen up. When the printer was released from it’s 2-month constipation period it gave a happy beep. I cut that short by retracting my fingers; the printer led lights went back to red.

I scrambled the nearest operator and asked in a serious tone:
&gt; “Do you have any tape I can use?”

He pointed me to a drawer further away and scurried off while giving me strange looks. ignoring his unspoken question I retrieved a roll of painter’s tape from the drawer, walked back to the printer and taped the lever down in a way that it would keep applying pressure with its pin to the button. The led lights turned back green. I double checked all the settings and to my pleasure the web interface stated the printer was operational. Success!

I drafted a mail later that day, addressed to all involved parties. 

&gt;
&gt;All,

&gt;I myself have been to the printer and was able to apply a temporary workaround by utilization of tape. See the attached picture.
Production can now continue until $DummieTeam has prepared the correct printer type to swap the faulty one.

&gt;Kind regards,

"I guess it was 'locked up', in a sense...","I work at the Corporate Help Desk for a mid sized company with multiple locations and divisions.  Thankfully we can answer our help desk calls from home so I've been doing the work from home life for the past few months.

*another 30 minutes later*

&amp;#x200B;

*Me- So what happened.*

&amp;#x200B;

Boss- I don't know how, I don't know why, but FD1 and GM decided when you told them to unplug the computer from the wall that meant going to the switch and unplugging everything from the switch! 

&amp;#x200B;

Me- \*Blink Blink\* huh?

&amp;#x200B;

Boss- Yeah, thank G\*d I had all cables labeled with the ports on it. I would have been there for HOURS!

&amp;#x200B;

Me- So what was the original issue?

&amp;#x200B;

Boss- The ethernet cable on the back of the front desk computer was unplugged. They never plugged it in!

&amp;#x200B;

Me- You have got to be kidding me! I asked them specifically to unplug and replug it! 

&amp;#x200B;

Boss- What's rule number 1 again?

&amp;#x200B;

Me- Users lie. \*face meet desk\* Boss, I need a drink!

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it, folks. All that headache and pain for an unplugged ethernet cable. Thank you for sharing in my pain and suffering. I know that you have choices in the stories that you read, and I would just like to personally thank you for reading mine.

I made a user cry recently (but in a good way),"We recently had an outage that caused a major issue with our AD server. I don't know all the details as I'm not on the team that manages servers, but all of our AD accounts were wiped out (supposedly this was due to an empty file that somehow got uploaded; this was all second hand information as I'm not on the team that manages servers). Apparently we couldn't restore from a backup because some service was randomly deleting accounts. So they made the decision to start recreating accounts and re-applying permissions they previously had. This means that when a computer gets connected to the network after all this happened, and a user logs in it creates a secondary profile. We're testing software to transfer documents/settings to this new profile to make it just like the old one, but until that's fully vetted we're doing things manually (we don't have roaming profiles).

I was working with one user who submitted a ticket requesting assistance. She told me if she could just get one file from her old profile, I would make her day. She had backed everything else up but this one file, which sounded very important and hard to redo, was the one thing she forgot. I navigated to her old profile folder in Windows and found the file in question within a minute. As I was doing this, she said ""If you find this file for me, I will literally cry on the phone."" I copied it to the new profile and opened to make sure it worked. I didn't hear full-on crying but it was quiet for a minute and the camera she had on was pointed away from her face, so I'm pretty sure she was crying.

She thanked me profusely, and I told her I was happy to help out. It reminded me that the work I do daily that seems simple for me can literally make someone else's workload ten times easier.",241,0,1
Head of the Division's Laptop battery has failed...,"He phones the emergency helpdesk number on the morning of a massive go-live for a multi-million Euro project across 15 sites and 6 countries.

""My laptop is telling me the battery has degraded and is no longer performing optimally. I need you to send me a new one.""

Call gets escalated to me as our site isn't going live for a couple of hours. I look up the machine info, it's a Surface. It's out of warranty, and due to be replaced back in April. Battery is not user-replaceable.

I tell the chap all this, and that as soon as we're able to get stock in he can have a brand new *shiny thing*.

Usually, this is enough to satisfy such people. But this morning he's reopened the ticket (a new one was created for the laptop order).

&gt; ""This machine is not running on battery at all now.  Means I am having to run on mains power all day, which is going to increase my electric bill if I am not going to see a new machine for a couple of months.""

He is based from home. He has been working from home for the entire 4 years I've been at this company. Where does he think his laptop battery power comes from??

Edit: He's replied to argue with me. 

&gt; Yep was charging the battery on the mains and then turning off the power and running on battery until it depleted then topped it up on mains and repeated as necessary.  Now it is not holding any charge so the only way I can use the laptop is to have it on mains all day.  As soon as I turn of the mains switch the laptop shuts down.  Therefore am using circa 8 hrs of mains electric as opposed to the two and bit I was using previously!!

I guess at this point I should mention the division he's head of sells *electrical items* to retailers.",289,0,1

You think I called you a what?,"Here’s another one from my dial-up tech support days.  This was probably 2004.

User calls in for help getting things going, because our install CD didn’t do the trick.  (Note, I worked for a small rural ISP, not AOL).

She was a nice enough older lady, and was doing a solid job following directions.  We were still having a rough go of it, for whatever reason, and things just weren’t working.  Finally after about 45 minutes she says, “Well I’ve had enough of this”, click.  OK, she’s frustrated, I get it.

Maybe 20 minutes later she calls back to cancel her account, and was polite about it.  No problem on my end, since I wasn’t trained or asked to do any kind of customer retention.  There were 3-4 local ISPs, and people moved around quite a bit.  When she signed up, she prepaid a few months and was due a refund, which had to be run through our main office.  (Again rural ISP, total staff of maybe 10 across both locations, and my location was usually just two of us.)

Me:  Customer Lady wants to cancel her account, and she needs a refund.

Coworker:  What did you say to her???

M:  Huh?

C:  Ooh, she called here and said you were very rude and called her names.

M:  Hmmm...nope

Alright, whatever....  but then shortly thereafter her husband calls.

Husband:  What did you say to my wife???

Me:  Nothing sir, we were working through an issue and she hung up in the middle of the call.

H:  No!  She said you called her a ****ing *****!!!

M:  Sir I assure you I did no such thing.

H:  You didn’t say it to her, you were talking to someone else!

M:  Sir I’m working in this office by myself today.  Who do you suggest I was talking to?

***Random customer walks in to pay their bill***

H:  Well we’re just talking right now, but if we were face to face it’d be different!

M:  Are you threatening me, sir?

H:  No, I’m just saying...

M:  ...OK.

The customers new computer will not power on!,"Greetings all. So in my town, I am a locally known computer guy. On the side from my full time job (Not tech related) I build systems for people, fix systems, set up new systems, etc. 

So this happened back in 1998, when Gateway Computers were a thing. I get a call from a lady, who I had never worked with before. She had obviously gotten my name and number by word of mouth in the community. 

So this one evening, she calls. She starts telling me how she just bought a brand new Gateway PC and how she got it all hooked up, plugged in etc, but when she pushes ""power"" nothing happens. So I ask her the usual stuff, ya know, are you sure its plugged in, is the plug you have it plugged into controlled by a wall switch, etc. She assures me the wall switch has nothing to do with her power, and assures me that everything is plugged in. So I had nothing going that evening and I thought, what the heck, I can make some quick cash.  So I get her address, tell her I can come right over. 

I get to her place knock on the door, and she greets me within a minute. I could tell on the phone that she was elderly and when she opened the door this was confirmed. So in the back of my head I was thinking something like, ""ahhhh, old lady didn't hook something up right."" --Come on dont judge you would have thought the same lol-

So I get to the PC and from what I can tell by just standing there, she seems to have things set up on the desk correctly. The PC (Back then desktop model) was positioned nicely and the monitor was on it, keyboard, mouse, and speakers were all present. I was thinking, ""Ohhh she probably does not have the monitor plugged into VGA or something like that. So i look behind the PC, hmmm, things seem connected just fine. I double checked them for looseness and all was good. I even saw that she had the power cable plugged in correctly.

Hmmm, I though well damn, maybe a power supply issue? it is new but ya never know! So anyway, I start tracing power lines from monitor and desktop to the back of her desk. They went straight to a nice new surge protector and were securely plugged in. I was a little confused. 

So next step, make sure her surge protector was on, as they all have a switch. I find the switch, dont see the switch lit up as they usually are. I flip the switch, dont make a difference. So next step, check the wall outlet that she has the thing plugged into. I look up, see the outlet and see that absolutely NOTHING is plugged into it. I look a little closer and I do see that she does have the surge protector plugged in, however; the surge protector is plugged into itself - LOL - I sat under the desk, trying not to laugh. After I contained myself, I pulled the surge protector plug out of itself, plugged it into the wall socket, flipped the switch, and got a light. Came out from under the desk, hit power on the desktop, and bingo, we have power lol. 

So not wanting to make her feel like an idiot, I just told her it looked like the power cable was not fully seated into the socket on the surge protector. Then I offered to set the system up for her at no extra charge. She accepted. In the end, I decided not to even charge her. it was such an easy fix and I just did not feel right about it and was happy to just help.",1734,0,1
The wireless isn't working.,"So... I have not been in a desktop support job for many years now but I am still designated the family IT support guy. I don't mind and often I can tell my mother what the issue is quite quickly and what to tell her IT support staff when they need info.With the whole lockdown happening, my mother has been provided a laptop from her employer to work remotely. One or two issues, no softphone was installed and when it was it was looking for a USB headset that is not present, no VPN installed so she had no access to network drives. This was all fixed... and then she leaves me a message and I try and help her.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom - I sat down this morning to work and wouldn't you know... wireless isn't working. What could be the problem? I tried getting hold of IT but I think it's too early for them.

Me - Ok, well some laptops have a button that disables and enables the wireless card. Check to see if that laptop has one and check if pressing it makes a difference. Also check your other devices, phone, tablet, personal laptop. Is the wireless network working there?

Mom - Yes that's all working. I can see the wireless network in the list on the other devices.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried helping her for an hour or so, recommending different things. Looking in Windows for some information. I eventually tell her to move into the room with the router and connected the Ethernet cable to the laptop so that her IT team can remote in and have a look. I am not allowed to as well, it's company policy.

I am out of ideas and leave her in the hands of her IT team.

Hours pass.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom - It's been five and a half hours and still nothing... until I called my boss and told her my problem. She asked me to send her a photo of the laptop and wouldn't you know it! She says she had the same laptop and there is a button above the top row of keys that turns the wireless off and on. I pressed it and poof! It works again. All that time wasted where I could have been working.

&amp;#x200B;

Me - Mom... scroll up and look at the first message I sent you this morning. Literally the first thing I told you to check.

&amp;#x200B;

Mom - Oh... My... God...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if she shared that bit of information with her boss but she was so embarassed after she realised she had the solution the entire time. She chalked it up to not understanding what I meant about checking for a wireless button/switch.

She didn’t have a space bar,"This was about 2002, and I was working as tech support for a local dial-up ISP.  It was an interesting time, because for many of our customers, they were using their first-ever computer.

So this user calls and I’m walking her through some connectivity issue.  Everything was going fine, and we were working through it.  At some point the old “Press any key to continue” message popped up.  Having heard “I don’t have an Any key” too many times, I’d gotten into the habit of telling people to hit their space bar.

User: “It says ‘press any key’”

Me: “OK, just go ahead and hit your space bar”

Tablet issues,"I work for a company that supports dental practice mangement software. We have an app customers can download to tablets that lets patients sign in to appointments, fill out paperwork, whatever, and the info gets sent right back to the patient database. 

Got an email from a bigger client complaining about how the app doesn’t work for certain features, etc. The email came from the office’s IT guy, who doesn’t really work directly with the teams, so sometimes tshooting is difficult because he’s not actually using the device. I sent him a list of questions to try to narrow down the issue (device type, device OS version, software version, type of document, etc). 

Two days go by, and I get this email (paraphrased but not by much):

“Acrollo,

Please disregard my last message. The staff who sent this complaint to me were trying to use the device in the radiography lab, which is shielded against radiation and cannot get wifi.

My toughest assignment yet...,"While tech support isn't my official job title, my slightly above average computer skills are sometimes called upon to help right the wrongs of the world, one device at a time. On this occasion it was my upstairs neighbor Barry, a nice older dude who needed help installing one of those voice-activated home assistant gadgets.

I said I'd see what I could do as I'd never set one up before (don't trust 'em personally), however it's always fun to challenge yourself and boy did he have one ready to go.

You see Barry already had a corporate robot controlling various things in his flat but wanted me to make it so that his new Googlebot would talk to the first one and make it do stuff.

I simply stood there in his living room for a moment, my mind buzzing with questions. Questions such as: 'Can this even be done?' 'Should this even be *attempted?'* 'What if I accidentally implode the universe?'

There was only one way to find out. I sat down cross-legged on the carpet and began furiously reading instruction manuals, Barry's laptop at the ready for when I inevitably needed backup.

Forty-five minutes later all I'd managed to do was turn said Googlebot on and connect it to the lappie. Just like I'd thought, these rival devices weren't exactly eager to communicate directly. As I started thinking I might have to swallow my pride and look it up online after all, Barry handed me a plate of the best home-made goat curry I've ever had, which perked me up considerably.

Another twenty minutes passed while I tried everything I could think of to make two competing AI's realize they weren't so different from each other. I don't even remember what I did in the end but eventually you could say, ""Hey Google, \[insert command here\]"" and it would relay your instructions to the other one without creating any spacial anomalies.

I left Barry's flat ten pounds richer and feeling rather god-like, another mission completed successfully.",186,0,1
Customers that just won't quit...,"Cross-posting this on r/idontworkherelady

This happened after the POS company I was Service Manager at went belly up and I was between jobs.

So, the Company had been around since the '50s and its clientele was a mix of companies that had been around forever and being run by old codgers who ""Knew the Founder"" and new businesses who needed it up and running ""NOW"" and usually were back out of business before the second payment was due.

This particular client was one of the former. We'll call her Mrs K. She was a 40's something Asian woman running a market in an upscale part of the area. She had bought her digital POS system back in the '70s and had seen no need at all to upgrade. Seeing as it was now 1989 this meant that we ""meaning ""I"") were the only company who could or would service them. And yes she was very much a Karen in the wild. 

I had worked for the company for seven years until that one fine day I was asked to hand in my pager. The company had gone under and I was out  of a job. I was also warned that I should not try to find another job in this particular field as they were listing the customer list as part of the companies assets and if I took that knowledge to a potential buyer it could open me to litigation. Probably BS, but fine. I was done with customer support. Customers really are the worst.  I was looking to shift to a new field (eventually finding a gig in Telecom, but that's not relevant to the story).

I'm sitting in my apartment looking through the want ads and then my phone rings. I answer hoping its an interview offer, but no. Its Mrs K.

Her registers were down and she wanted me to come fix them.

&amp;#x200B;

Right.

&amp;#x200B;

I was and still am speechless. She found out the company was no longer, and somehow in the pre internet days found my HOME phone number! It wasn't even listed in the name I used at the company. Best guess is she called everyone with my relatively common surname in the phone book for the city the company was in. 

So after some unpleasantries I decided this had to be the end of it. But I knew she'd never stop calling me unless I put a nail in it. I agreed to come down to her store. It was and still is a nice drive and a day on the shore of the bay would be nice anyway. I told her though, if it was programming I could fix it, but anything that required parts and they were dead and going to stay that way. And I would need cash payment at the companies old after hours rate. 

I got there and it was a mix of issues on her three machines. I got one machine frankensteined together using parts from the other two, but I told her that was the end and I could no longer support her machines.. well, machine.

Asked for my companies bill rate in cash and to her credit she did hand me $250 in cash. Nice. Much better than what I had been making an hour.

&amp;#x200B;

She did try to get me a couple more times but I always politely refused. A few months later I moved and got a new phone number and that was the end. I don't think she ever replace that poor machine. The store is now owned by a high end chain market so I'm hoping Mrs K is enjoying her retirement and won't come back to pester me again.",629,0,1
Why isn't this fixed? So we have to open a helpdesk ticket?,"So this happened about 5 1/2 years ago, but this problem creeps up from time to time.

I go on-site at one of our branch sites to help with a system installation and meet with the new manager there. We are at a central office and only travel to remote sites as needed. This current site is about 150 miles travel distance. So we only go when needed. The manager was recently promoted from within the company so we had interacted before. During the conversation, the manager finally mentions the point.

Manager: So we have several things that need to be addressed up here.

Me: OK. I do not have any tickets open on anything besides the new system installation. What's up?

Manager: Well there is (gives example 1 of a change), (gives example 2 of a change), (gives example 3 of a change) and the display monitor in the lobby is broken. I need all of the changes addressed today.

Me: Well, I will see if I have time.

Manager: What do you mean? Can you do them or not?

Me: Of course, I can do them, ... if I have time.

Manager: I don't understand why you are fighting me on this. And why isn't the monitor already fixed? They say that it has been broken for months. I am going to need you to just come on-site every week from now on.

Me: Number 1, I'm not fighting you. My priority for this visit is the new system installation that you called me in on to be a part of.  I have no idea what they need me for today so I will work on these other issues if they do not need me for something. Are you saying that you are now changing that priority to making these changes?

Manager: No that has to be accomplished.

Me: Number 2, I have never been notified through the helpdesk ticket system, an email, or even a call that the monitor was down. Corporate requires trouble tickets entered for EVERY problem. No one has let me know about it. We make trips when we are needed and can not fix the issue remotely. I will come once a week, twice a week, or even spend the night  IF NEEDED. But there are no trouble tickets open for anything at this location.

Manager: So we need to enter trouble tickets?

Me: Yes, 

Manager: You will not just come up here and see what is needed?

Me: Sir have you ever used a plumber?

Manager: What? ... well yeah.

Me: So do you call the plumber and tell him your sink is leaking or do you just wait for the off chance that he is going to randomly show up to your house and notice the problem on his own?

Manager: Ah .....

Me: We do need some communication from you and your staff on what your needs are BEFORE the day we walk in the door. I do not mean to be argumentative, but having us come down here for 4-5 problems and then jumping us with 4 more problems that we are unprepared for and have no additional time for is not the proper way to communicate needs to us.

Manager: They don't do that....

Me: Sir, (once again no offense) but you just did it. 

I wish I can say that it ended on something very dramatic but honestly the manager understood my issues and said he would communicate that with his staff and supervisors. Oh, and I did not go to lunch that day and left 2.5 hours late because I made all of the changes he needed and stayed until the installation was complete. BTW, no one ever opened a ticket on that monitor.

Edit: 1. The monitor was fixed about 2 weeks later when I came back. 

2. I opened a ticket myself for every issue I did that day. The ticket for the monitor was also opened by myself later. I know that these actions reinforced users stance on not making tickets themselves, but EVERY fix requires a ticket.",1845,0,1
These Chargers Are Universal Right?,"I'm the Apple Systems Administrator for a decent sized school district with a huge Apple deployment (hence why they need a dedicated admin). This also means if any of our VIPs have problems with ANYTHING Apple related I get a phone call, Help Desk be hanged.

I have never been able to get into this,"The business I work at isn’t -in my opinion- big enough for a ticketing system. We have 3 guys supporting about 100 users and we do all the network stuff for corporate and the branch in England and the one in China (England has about 50 people total and their own IT guy, China about 20 people total and their own IT guy). 

So we work solely off phone calls and email, and since recently, Teams. We communicate between each other in our office about issues and we divide our work load between us 3. 

Anyway, yesterday I received a phone call from a user who couldn’t get into Teams and was late for a meeting. 
I sent him our record of his credentials and he calls me back saying it didn’t like it. 
So I reset his password and made my way over there to enter it for him. The password took, all was well, and the user was happy. 

So the lady in the cubicle next to me walks up very irate and goes:

Lady: “I need help also. I have *never* been able to get into this. I need into the same meeting.”

She then walked away. 

So I say to her quickly receding back:

Me: “Ill be right back, I’ll have to go fetch your credentials.”

Didn’t get a reply.

Expecting a similar issue, I walked back to my office, performed a password reset on her account, and walked back with her credentials printed on a piece of paper, so I could hand it to her for her future reference in case stuff decided to log itself out again.

—

So our situation is a little weird, which arguably makes it a bit confusing for some people; we have Office 365, but we are still hosting our own Exchange server, so the log in for all of Office (including Teams) uses a different, separate email address for each user than what all our users email addresses are they use for work, if that makes sense. 

That means, in our case, that meetings can’t be set up or joined from Teams, they have to be set up and joined from Outlook, because otherwise the meetings don’t show up in the correct box. We’ve explained this to all our users *ad nauseam* in several emails, over the phone, and face to face, and continue to do so because it doesn’t stick. 
—

I get back to her cubicle, and she’s gone. Other than her cryptic “I’ve never been able to get into this either.” I don’t have anything to go on. 

So I double click on her Teams icon and Teams comes up, it’s logged in, I sent myself a chat message to test and it went through fine. 

Not knowing or seeing any issue, and her being gone, I just left. I was in the middle of something when my earlier user called and only because he was already late did I get up right away. 

By the time I get back to my office, I see an email from Lady that says “I still have problems getting into Teams.”

Completely confused I decide to walk back, and it takes about 2 minutes to get there. 

Me: “Okay Lady, show me what you’re trying to do because I was just here and Teams works fine.”

Lady: “Well, first of all, what’s taking you so long, my meeting is over now, so thank you very much, and why didn’t you fix this problem when you were just here?!”

Me: “....I’m sorry? I was here and you were gone, and I didn’t know what your problem was other than you said Teams didn’t work. I verified that Teams was in fact working, so I left. I have a bit of a busy morning.”

She’s bristling at this point

Lady: “Well, go to my calendar in Outlook and you’ll see.”

So I maximize her Outlook screen and her list of inboxes and calendars is such a cluster I can’t find shit, so very annoyed, she almost pokes her finger *through* her screen to point where her calendar is. She’s got multiple repeating meetings every week so I just click on one so I can find the link for Teams that’s embedded in it and click on it. 

Lady: “That’s not gonna work, that meeting isn’t even started yet. That’s not till next week. The one from today is over so that doesn’t work anymore.”

Me: “You can join next week’s meeting now if you want to. It’ll be lonely, but the link works. So I’m trying to see what’s wrong here.”

Turns out her Office 365 was logged out and her Teams was logged in. They use the same credentials but obviously if one of them is logged out, the other one isn’t gonna work. 

So I log her 365 in for her and try again, and surprise surprise, it works. 

Lady: “That’s ridiculous. That should have been fixed a long time ago.”

Me: “I agree, this wasn’t necessary. It only took a minute to fix.”

Lady: “Exactly! I’ve been dealing with this for months!”

Me: “Well, next time something is wrong, if you’d just send us an email or call us, we can help you straight away so you won’t have to wait until it’s too late. We can’t fix issues were unaware of. You have a good one now!”

"Remotely upgrading OpenWrt is easy, right?","*Note:* *Long time lurker, first time poster. Apologies if it's a bit on the technical side; I originally wrote this for my website, but I think you people might enjoy this, too.*

Some time ago, I was tasked with upgrading a few dozen Routerboards without physical access. You'd think, ""well, that sounds like a routine job""—but ooh boy, you're in for a ride! Here's the thing: When the LEDE project split off from OpenWrt, they, among other things, changed the file system used for flash based systems from yaffs2 to UBIFS.

yaffs2 isn't mainline, so I fully understand why it was switched out. But LEDE didn't just switch over the default filesystem, they also completely removed yaffs2 support simultaneously. So OpenWrt 15 speaks yaffs2 but no UBIFS, and later versions speak UBIFS but no yaffs2. So how do you upgrade such a system? Well, the manual just tells you plug in a serial cable and reinstall locally from scratch. Not so easy when you have dozens of devices, scattered all around the state.

Now seems like a good moment to talk more about the Routerboard 450g: It's a small embedded Linux system based on the MIPS-powered ar71xx chipset, with a custom proprietary bootloader and a single SLC flash chip. This flash chip has a few partitions, most notably a 3.4MB ""kernel"" partition and a larger one for the ""rootfs"". The bootloader looks at this kernel partition, and expects an ELF file to boot from there. Guess what filesystem the bootloader expects? Correct, yaffs2.

To this day I haven't figured out how OpenWrt's sysupgrade(8) tool manages to install its kernel onto this partition without support for the underlying filesystem, but at this point I honestly didn't really care any more.

There are some extra challenges, like OpenWrt 15's sysupgrade tool not supporting NAND flash, and the wget2nand utility keeping the existing filesystem intact (meaning I can install OpenWrt 19, but the new kernel can't read the (yaffs2) userland, and won't boot). We also didn't want to deploy a custom kernel with yaffs2 support patched back in, since that'd just complicate further upgrades, so we'd have to deal with the whole thing again in a year or two.

At this point, after chasing a bunch of dead ends, I recapped what I found out:

 * The old kernel can't read the new filesystem, and vice versa,
 * The old sysupgrade tool can't be used to upgrade, since it doesn't support NAND flash,
 * wget2nand can't be used either, since it assumes the rootfs filesystem doesn't change,
 * Upgrading just the userland and keeping the old kernel is neither secure, nor supported, nor does it work. 

Oh, and did I mention that there's no DHCP on the target network, so you better not fuck up the network config?

Getting desperate, I for a short while contemplated just grabbing a kernel image with an initramfs from openwrt.org and just using that flashed to the ""kernel"" partition without ever touching ""rootfs"". But that won't work, because with this image will forget any changes you make to it on reboot. Not just the configuration of the software we need on the device, but even basic things, like the static IP its supposed to have. But with this idea in my mind, some gears started turning.

Maybe it clicked already for some of you. So here's what we ended up doing:

 1. Compile a minimal OpenWrt 19 image with an initramfs that fits in the small kernel partition. It just has a UBIFS-kernel, busybox, sshd and sysupgrade (occupied just ~2.5MB of the 3.4 available, so could even fit some debug utils). We hard-code the network config and rebuild for each device, so our Routerboards get a valid IP when they boot from this image.
 2. Log into the old OpenWrt system, upload said image into tmpfs and manually upgrade the kernel to our new image. This requires mounting the MTD block device and copying the file there (wget2nand turned out to be useful to steal copy-paste commands from)
 3. Reboot. If all goes well, we are now in our minimal system, and hopefully have the correct IP and sshd running
 4. Transfer the official sysupgrade.bin upgrade file and a tape archive containing a minimal configuration (sshd, network) and install it with sysupgrade
 5. Wait for the device to automatically reboot, pray the install worked, and reconfigure the device with Ansible

Success, finally!

This solution actually worked flawlessly for all but one device: As luck would have it, this device was manufactured with a MLC flash chip, which UBIFS can't handle and refuses to use. There's an interesting thread in the OpenWrt mailing list about that, where the vendor admitted to have swapped out chips for a ""short time in 2010"". Lucky for us (for real this time), this is the one device that is in the basement of our office and not one of those out in the field. So we just binned it.",86,0,1

I don't understand what you mean....,"Hello Everyone. This phone call literally just happened and I can't stop laughing. I'm not sure if its because I'm going mad or because of how ridiculous it is.

Our warehouse manager (Frank) in one of our remote offices called us because all of their equipment just went offline. Their VoIP phones, their file server, the modem/router, everything. Now this user isn't a rock star user but they usually are great at following instructions and doing basic troubleshooting like unplugging and plugging something back in. However for some reason they seemed to have forgotten everything there is to know about anything electronic for this call. The call started with tier 1, I got interested in the call after a little bit (tier 2), and then our network admin got involved in the middle. Here is how that call went

TLDR at bottom

\&gt;Uirrelsquay: Hello Frank, This is Uirrelsquay from TechSupport. How can I assist you?

\&gt;Frank: Nothing is working! Everything is down!

\&gt;Uirrelsquay: Yes Frank we were just about to call you. We see that all of your networking devices are offline. Do you have power to the building?

\&gt;Frank: I have several devices that I normally have on that are off

\&gt;Uirrelsquay: Yes we see that the devices are off but is there power to the building? Like are the lights still on?

\&gt;Frank: The lights are on yes but I have devices that are not on

&amp;#x200B;

This is where I (Lorixs) get interested in the call and I come over to chat with Frank

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Lorixs: Frank, this is Lorixs with TechSupport joining in. I need you to go into your networking closet and check on the equipment in there

\&gt;Frank: I'm in the closet and nothing is on.

\&gt;Lorixs: All right, is everything in that room plugged into one battery backup or a surge protector perhaps?

\&gt;Frank: What do you mean?

\&gt;Lorixs: The devices in that room, what are they plugged into.

\&gt;Frank: wait a minute, hold on one second

&amp;#x200B;

Frank then steps away from the phone and starts messing with things

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Frank: None of the devices are working!

\&gt;Lorixs: Yes Frank, I understand that. What are the devices plugged into?

\&gt;Frank: They are all plugged into each other.

&amp;#x200B;

Uirrelsquay and I looked at each other but had no words for we had no idea what he meant. At this point the network admin (Barret) walked over to join in on the call.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Barret: Frank, what do you mean they are plugged into each other? what is plugged into the wall?

\&gt;Frank: wait a minute, hold on one second

&amp;#x200B;

*Frank steps away a second time and starts rustling with things*

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Frank: I have two devices that are working. An ""A-D-Tran"" and the router

\&gt;Barret: Wait so two devices are working in that room?

\&gt;Frank: That is correct.

\&gt;Barret: Ok so what is the Adtran plugged into?

&amp;#x200B;

*There is a long pause before Frank answers*

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Frank: I only have two devices that are working!

\&gt;Barret: Frank, I need you to listen. What is the Adtran plugged into.

\&gt;Frank: I have an ""A-D-Tran"" and a router

\&gt;Barret: \*sigh\* all right what is the ""A-D-Tran"" plugged into

\&gt;Frank: They are all plugged into the hard drive.

\&gt;Barret: .....the what?

\&gt;Frank: wait a minute. hold on a second

&amp;#x200B;

Frank disappears from the phone for a few minutes leaving the three of us completely stupified.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Frank: Could it be the strip bar?

\&gt;Uirrelsquay: You mean a power strip or a surge protector? Is that what they are plugged into?

\&gt;Frank: No, they are all plugged into each other.

\&gt;Barret: Frank, I need to you stop and listen to me. Don't look at any devices, just look at the wall. What is plugged into the wall?

\&gt;Frank: I can't hear you over the beeping

\&gt;Barret: What beeping?

\&gt;Frank: wait a minute, hold on a second

&amp;#x200B;

Frank once again disappears from the phone. We all know at this point it has to be the Battery Backup that went bad and thats why everything shut down. So Barret tells us to handle it because he is going home.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Frank: I think its the server

\&gt;Lorixs: You think what is the server?

\&gt;Frank: The server doesn't turn on

\&gt;Lorixs: Yes Frank, we know the server doesn't turn on. Go to the device that is beeping.

\&gt;Frank: All right the device shows an error of F04.

\&gt;Lorixs: All right that means the battery backup is dead. I need you to unplug everything out of the battery backup and plug it into a surge protector instead.

\&gt;Frank: I don't understand what you mean

\&gt;Lorixs: All right, first unplug the battery backup from the wall.

\&gt;Frank: It isn't plugged into the wall.

\&gt;Lorixs: What is it plugged into?

\&gt;Frank: wait a minute. hold on a second

&amp;#x200B;

Frank once again disappears from the phone. In the background I can hear the awesome sales guy Lloyd, telling Frank what he needs to do.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Frank: All right it is not plugged into the wall.

\&gt;Lorixs: All right, now unplug everything out of the back of it

\&gt;Frank: What do you mean?

\&gt;Lorixs: We need to take that battery backup out of that room. So nothing needs to be plugged into it.

\&gt;Lloyd: *Talking to Frank* See the back there? they want you to pull out all the cables from there.

\&gt;Frank: No that isn't what they want me to do!

\&gt;Uirrelsquay: Listen to Lloyd, Frank. That is exactly what we want you to do.

\&gt;Frank: wait a minute. Hold on a second.

&amp;#x200B;

It the background i hear Frank and Lloyd arguing. Eventually I heard Lloyd say ""I'm out"". I died a little inside.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Frank: Ok nothing is plugged into it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Both Uirrelsquay and I didn't believe him so we asked him to take it out of the room. Surprisingly he actually did it and was able to accomplish that task.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Lorixs: Ok now I need you to plug all the devices into a power strip that is plugged into the wall.

\&gt;Frank: That is not going to work

\&gt;Lorixs: Why is that not going to work Frank?

\&gt;Frank: I have 6 plugs and only 5 outlets on this strip bar

\&gt;Lorixs: Can you plug the 6th item directly into the wall?

\&gt;Frank: wait a minute. hold on a second

&amp;#x200B;

Frank disappears once again. He finally comes back with a second power strip

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;Frank: all right im just gonna plug these two strip bars together and that will give me enough.

\&gt;Lorixs: You should plug that second ""Strip bar"" into the wall instead of into the other one

\&gt;Frank: .....everything is coming online now!

\&gt;Lorixs: Thats good but did you plug those ""strip bars into each other?

\&gt;Frank: Just so you guys know I'm going on vacation next week so you will have to call Lloyd next week.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Click\*

&amp;#x200B;

.....we will gladly call Lloyd instead.

Laptop hide and seek,"Long ago, when I was working for a consulting firm.

We had a client that was a nursing provider, one of the divisions of the provider was homecare. Meaning that nurses would go out and about. We determined that one of the nurses was re-infecting the network shares every few days. Luckily a backup of the network shares was running every 4 hours…

We had it almost timed to when it was going to happen. One of our network admins was able to find the laptop responsible for it, in the logs.

I was tasked to find the laptop, and remove it from the network. The problem was that it was a laptop the changed hands, so we never knew who exactly had it. Our system told us the last user on it, and they had 5 locations. So, we could see what location it was at. However, with it being mobile, we would have to track it to the next location, if it moved. Not being sure who had it, meant that we had to track it down by hand.

NA = Network admin co worker

Me = Me

NA: Okay we got a live one, it is at location 4. It is connecting to AP#. So, you have an idea. Go find it and get it off the network!

I drive across town to the location and start hunting.

ME: I can’t find it, in this location.

NA: Yeah, I stopped getting a response from it about 3 minutes after you left.

ME: Gee, thanks, you could have called me.

NA: Well, I was hoping it would pop up again.

As I get back to my car, I get a phone call again from NA.

NA: it’s on the move! It popped up at location 1 on AP#, Go, go, go!

&amp;#x200B;

I drive to location 1, walk in, go to the area that AP covers. Sitting all by itself is a laptop. I check the SN, it's the one I have been looking for!

NA: Nice, get it off the network!

ME: Done.

NA: Bring it back and reimage it.

ME: What about the user, they are no ware to be found.

NA: I don't really care, leave a note and your business card...

As I’m writing an “I owe you” the user came back to retrieve it. I let them know what is going on and that they will need to go get a loaner for now. Being a bit embarrassed that they have been causing all the chaos, they at least understood.

Another missing switch (sort of),"I read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/hfppwv/tracking_down_the_phantom_switch/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) earlier today and it reminded me of a similar situation.  

20 years ago (man time flies) I worked for a gas station chain.  We had little gas stations in front of the world's largest retailer from Texas to Miami and as far north as Michigan.  We were a 6 man shop supporting about a 1,000 stores at the time.  We were jack-of-all-trades.  We would go out into the field and install POS systems at new stores, take turns working the help desk for 2 weeks, or go out into the field to go on maintenance runs (we would hit a whole bunch of stores within driving distance of one another to perform minor repairs or replace minor equipment).  Most of the maintenance runs were done at night, usually after the store closed.  It was not unusual to be at a station at closing, do what needed to be done, drive an hour or more to another station and perform the tasks there, and then hit the next one.  Check into a motel sleep all day and start the process over the next night.

Part of this chain's gimmick was that they accepted the retailers shopping/gift card and would give a 3 cent discount.  To do this, there was a fiber run between the gas station and the retailer.  This was a big improvement over the LOS antennas previously used, but that's a different story.  Anyway, the fiber connected our POS to the retailers network so that it could communicate with the ""authorizer"" in the home office in the Ozarks.

That's a lot of back story, but bear with me.  So during my time on the help desk, I would get calls from a particular store in Florida about the gift cards not authorizing.  This went on for a couple of months, the other techs and I tried everything we knew.  It was a weird situation.  The cards would work during the day and seemed to stop working around 10 pm every night.  Thanks to a lawsuit from a competing gas station chain, the 3 cent discount could not be offered at the stores in this area and without that incentive, we didn't have a lot of shopping card volume at that store anyway.  So we just threw up our hands and left it on the back burner.

A few months later, I was on one of the aforementioned maintenance runs in Florida.  We were doing some reprogramming of the pumps and it required us to test credit card and gift card transactions.  Programmed the pumps and tested credit cards.  Check.  Test the shopping card, doesn't work.  It was at that point I realized this was THAT store.  Time to do some on-site troubleshooting.  I tried everything we had done remotely and still didn't have an idea.  I checked the Digibox converter at the store (converted the fiber to RJ-45).  It showed there was a connection to our 8 port switch, but not to the retailer.  Across the parking lot I went.

I managed to bluff my way into the switch/server room of a store of the world's largest retailer with no more than a business card.  When the night manager walked me into the room, the lights were out.  She hit the light switch and I located the Digi box on this side of the connection.  The lights on it showed a connection.  Weird!  But I hadn't noticed any status lights from that area when the overhead lights were off.  Playing a  hunch, I turned the lights back off and the status lights went off.  Millions of dollars spent on store layout and design, and the world's largest retailer had put an outlet in their switch room that was tied to the light switch!  Moved the plug, cut the lights to confirm that the converter stayed on, went back across the parking lot and lo and behold, the shopping cards worked.  It seems the maintenance people cleaned the floors in that room every night about 10 and turned off the lights on their way out.  Someone came in about 6 in the morning and turned the lights back on.

Tl;dr: after months of troubleshooting an issue remotely, ended up onsite and discovered the problem was that the world's largest retailer had the outlet we had our equipment plugged into tied to the overhead light switch.",507,0,1

The 6 hour cabling fix,"Brief stint with a MSP between jobs.

I get sent to a customer's location, internet connection to one of the workstations isn't working. Even though I'm new to the company and have never been to this client's site, it seems easy enough to diagnose and fix.

Get there and have a look, sure enough, no link. Swap out patch cable, no luck. Check it on a laptop, no link. 

It's a back office in an add-on wing, construction company. Generally dirty and abused, so I grab a new keystone, re-punch it, plug it back in with new cable nothing.

I call back to the office and ask for a wiring diagram. Nothing of any use, jack isn't labeled, so I go to the network closet and look for a dead port. Well, there's about 10 of them. Cables left over from who-knows-when still plugged into the main switch.

I end up re-terminating all of them to see if one magically springs to life. No luck. I have no tracker/toner, so I drive back to the office to grab one.

I get back to the client's site and put the toner on the dead port, and hunt for it in the network closet. I get a wisp here and there, but cannot for the life of me find this connection.

So now I start arguing that there's no way this port worked. According to the mostly useless diagram, it home runs all the way back to the network closet. They insist they've used this for years, so I keep digging.

I chase the wire up into the 6"" drop ceiling, where it almost instantly disappears through ducts/pipes/etc. Most of it is inaccessible because of equipment in the way. I pop what tiles I can and piece the run together. Ok, it runs to the net closet, but I'm not getting a tone on that cable, and it's showing link on the main switch, so that can't be the one.

I check the cable and the footage marks. They match up. This is the same cable by all accounts, but it has link on one side but not the other, and a tone isn't getting through.

Finally, I say I have to trace this inch by inch, and I need them to move all this equipment. Another hour on site with both customer and I getting increasingly frustrated, and I track it down. After some crap is moved out of the way, I see an extension cord fed up into the ceiling and it finally hits me.

Trace it out and sure enough, there's a cheapo 4-port hub stashed in the ceiling. I pull the power, reboot it, and boom, it works.

Apparently at some point, someone cut that cable in the ceiling, and instead of using a scotch lock, or even a butt connector, decided to terminate both ends into a hub as a patch. This was apparently done by the MSP before us, so it was never documented.

Tracking down the phantom switch,"I've been working with my employer for about 6 months on a brand new site. I'm the only IT on site and the main service desk is in the head office about 200 miles away.

During the move I found a whole bunch of spaghetti under the desks, daisy chained power extentions, POE injectors and a little 8 port switch, all in use and dumped under the desks.

After sorting through it all and getting stuff moved into the new office space I had a lot of left over equipement, including the switch.

I get back to my desk and within 30 minutes I'm getting SolarWind alerts for a switch down.

I spent an hour checking every cab on the site (I'm not familar with where they all are yet so the name didn't give me a clue). I finally got back to my desk and thought about the 8 port switch sitting in a box in my store room.. surely not, I thought.

Earlier this week I got an email from that user where she claimed that the phone was really slow to charge and that it was probably something with the battery. She'd tried different chargers and cables that she had in her house but every time it needed about a day to fully recharge.

That's a bit too long for a phone to normally need in terms of charge rates. So we offered to take a look at it next time she was in the office. Her normal office is about 20 meters away from IT so, I figured it wouldn't be a problem. But it turns out it was.

The user replied via mail that she wasn't going to be coming in to the office for the next few weeks because she didn't need to and afterwards she was going on vacation. And we just had to mail her a replacement charger.

Now we've had issues in the past when we use the post service to send IT-related gear out to home adresses. Too many things have arrived damaged, or have been stolen from their envelopes/packages. Plus if it's not the charger but something else I don't think sending a new charger via post will help a lot.

So I write to her in reply: Sorry, but due to issues with theft and damage when we send things through the post we don't do that anymore. I understand it's a bit of a hassle but you can keep your phone plugged in to the charger to mitigate the problem until you've got the chance to get back in to the office so I can do a proper diagnosis and replacement if that's nessecary.  


Well that wasn't the answer she was looking for, she replied: I've removed all my accounts from the phone and turned it off. It's not working as it should. And company gear should be working flawlessly. So I will not be using it until I have gotten a replacement.

At least she's standing on principle I suppose?",165,0,1
Short but sweet,"We sell high end auto accessories online. A customer bought an item from us about 2 weeks ago and had it professionally installed. He wrote us yesterday to say that part of it broke off, and he sent pictures. He was very upset and I felt he was already defensive, and ready to argue with us.

I created a tech support ticket for him, attached the pictures and escalated the situation to the person who needed to see it. Now, because this was professionally installed, we could easily tell him to go back to his installer, but it was just a few weeks old and easy enough for us to replace under warranty.

I contacted the customer back and let him know we would be sending him out a new part right away, sent him tracking, and closed the ticket.

He wrote an email to my supervisor praising my handling of the situation. He stated he was ready for a fight, already angry and expecting us to give him grief. He praised my professionalism, my kindness and the swiftness with which I sent a replacement.

My boss posted the email on our company message thread for all to see, and also praised me. I have to admit, it was a nice change from dealing with the normal irate customer who can't hook their stuff up because they never read the directions or take personal responsibility for being the cause of their own problems.

Thank you nice customer. I appreciate you taking the time to write in something positive!",1018,0,1
"Freaking out my boss, and the need for a strong personality in the work place.","Hey all!

Had a fun one at work today I thought I'd share while I wait on hold. I'll try to be as clear and concise if it becomes a wall of text.

Me - well it's me

CM - client manager

CW - coworker and tier 1 tech

Boss - owner of our MSP

Backdrop:

I work at our client office being their on site Sys. Admin and jack of all things plugged in. I typically leave early afternoon due to my start time, and my MSP teammates take over handling remote tickets till end of day at the client. 

Monday after I left we got a request about a staff member having trouble logging into his remote access through our remote software vendor portal. One of our tier one techs took the email, diagnosed the issue correctly based off the details provided, sent back context with screenshots of how to fix this, and offered to speak directly with the staff at that time. 

The client manager who submitted the request sort of ignored that context by giving a ""Well could this random thing be the issue?"" type of reply, which sparked some side conversation for 20ish minutes before fizzling out with a ""Ok I will forward the staff member your screenshots and original email.""

Our tech at this point considered the ticket awaiting client reply, and ended up clocking out for the day at his appropriate time with me CC'd on everything to catch up the next day. The next day was hell. I had scanners malfunctioning, managers from multiple depts pulling me for urgent tickets outside of the email queue, and as of that point we had about 120+ from my client in our inbox since Monday morning (but only 4 tickets left open!). 

I was able to directly communicate with the staff member the following day to see how they had fared with our advice, considering no response usually is a good thing with my clients. They hadn't had time to try things out, but I explained over the phone and took less than 5min to walk them through everything to a resolution. Ship shape, good to go. Until...

*email ding*

CM: Why did it take three days to resolve this ticket? Also the tech at your HQ ignored my emails and stopped replying for no reason. 

Me: Well it looks like he did get it correct in the first reply, with screenshots for context, and an offer to phone the staff directly. I was too busy the following day to follow up on a ticket for remote access knowing that staff member was in the office that day. (I named managers that asked me to do the tickets outside of queue in this communication.) But I did give that (important) staff member my cell phone to avoid delays for this stuff. 

CM: Well are you sure you want staff calling you? I guess that's fine, I just know that they wanted this resolved Monday, and then expected it to be followed up on Tuesday but I understand you were busy. This is a let down, your other tech dropped the ball completely. 

Me: Well I confirmed CW did diagnose the issue correctly, and offered to spend time on the phone with the staff before CW left for the day. I don't think we got a follow up email after you offered to forward this information to the staff, and typically CW would be awaiting that reply before further work is carried out.

CM: Well this all would have been easier if someone had just been able to call the staff member on the first day. I shouldn't have to play the in between here, as a manager. 

Me: Agreed, that's why I gave my phone number directly to (important) staff members today in light of this incident. That way at the minimum I can properly play middle man and avoid these situations going forward. I am OK with that. 

CM: Well we prefer all ticket requests go through me or my assistant manager so we aren't in the dark. (Both of these users have accounts with access to the ticketing system)

At this point I began documenting and CC'ing bosses on this for the old CYA policy we love so much. I gave the boss a synopsis in our work chat program to which he said he would try to get caught up. 

I wasn't sure how to respond to the last email considering the contradiction it displayed, so I just let it stew a couple hours before my boss messaged me back.

Boss: Please just let that email chain die now, no need to keep responding. I see exactly what happened, I am happy with our ticket response there.

Client relations != sucking up to clients

I stood up for my coworker because he did a bang up job in my absence covering my client, and was unfairly shot with feedback by a client staff looking for blood because they were most likely spoken to about it internally. My boss typically is not the type to get into those types of chats with clients, so that was where ""freaking out my boss"" comes in. But hey, sometimes you need to put your foot down on strong personalities and make then hear ""No"" every now and then. 

Good luck out there techs.",1056,0,1
Are you LAUGHING at ME!?!?!?!?,"I used to work for a very large and prominent university in Arizona. I was in the IT section of the university's 24/7 call center, which also meant being the only team dealing with professors. On this particular day I was working from home with my squeaky office chair.

I receive a call from a persnickety professor from the Business Admin/Economics departments. This man, like almost every PhD I have ever come across, did not know how to set a date and time for an online test on Blackboard (similar to Canvas). He has used it for over a decade and messes it up every single semester and in every single class.

Professor: (*urgently*) None of my students can get into the midterm and you need to fix it now!

Me: (*taking a deep breath to prevent internal dying*) Ok, sir, your students cannot get into the test, I'm assuming this is Blackboard? (We had 2-3 online course areas depending on what department/school you were in within the university).

Professor: Of course! Where the hell else would it be?

Me: Ok, do you have the \[course information needed to assist him\]

Professor: Yes it's ECON 200 section #####

Me: I will work on pulling it up now, it will take a few moments. What days and times would you like the test to be available.

Professor: Today

Me: (*dying inside, what about multiple days and what hours)*

I continued searching for and working on the test settings within the course.

Professor: Are you going to finish anytime soon?

Me: (*sitting up in my chair, it squeaks*) I am just pulli----

Professor: ArE YoU \*\*\*\*iNg LaUgHiNg At ME?????????

I just sat there for a few seconds in complete shock. First, that he would actually say that to someone trying to help him, and second, that he thought a chair squeak sounded like laughter. I don't think he was hugged enough as a child.

Me: I am sorry, sir, but I was not laughing at you. That was my chair squeaking as a I sat forwa---

Professor: Oh, yeah, sure. A likely \*\*\*\*ing story. Just open the damn test! \*click\*

So, I opened the test. He never did tell me the exact times he wanted the test open. So, I opened it from the moment the call ended to 15 minutes later. Plus, I marked his entire online class for deletion at the end of the semester meaning he would have to recreate everything from scratch. I was fairly jaded by the time this happened.

I don't feel bad at all. I worked there for 20 months and not once had a pleasant experience with a PhD. They love making you feel like crap because you don't have those 3 letters after your name. Despite the fact they are calling you because they have spent their entire careers using computers but are still baffled by the Num Lock key. 

I have many stories from that time, but it will take time to compile them all.",525,0,1
But what if we just reset his password?,"So let me preface this by saying that we have a love-hate(but mostly hate) relationship between our team and our engineers on site. Don't get me wrong they know stuff I don't but computers are not their thing even when they think it is.

Me- Hi that's me  
EU- End User  
Eng- Engineer  


Me- Thanks for calling what can I do for ya  
Eng- Yeah I have my general manager who is having issues getting locked out. I think he's going to need a new password because he forgets it frequently.   
Me- Sure what's his name I'll pull him up and we can take a look  


He gives me his name and sure enough he is locked out in AD. Lets see where it's locking him out at and when. Looks like a once a day even at random times reporting back to his work laptop. Now with everyone working remote and our recent email upgrade I've seen tons of issues with programs using cached credentials instead of asking for a new password. They still function but lock the users out.  


Eng- Alright I'm going to bring GM on the call and we can get him a new password  
Me- I don't think he needs a new password looks like something on his computer is locking him out. But bring him on and I'll get on his machine and take a look.  


He brings on the End User and I walk him through getting remoted in. Nothing special so I'll skip that. However one thing I unlocked his AD account right before emailing him out remote link and he was locked out as I remoted over. He didn't put in his password anywhere. Unlocked again and almost immediately locked out while I was remoted where I could verify he didn't login in. So doesn't need a new password.

Me- So I just unlocked you while remoted over and it looks like you got locked out right away. So doesn't look like this has to do with a wrong password so lets see if we can track down what is causing it.  
Eng- Yeah, he probably just needs a new password and to log in to his phone with it  
EU- But I know my password I'm not entering it in wrong.(Oh golly how many times I've heard this but it be wrong. However this wasn't appearing to be the case for once).  


Locking at his account he recently had his password updated. Working remote. Yeah recipe for computer not syncing his password properly. Close out of outlook and chrome the only two programs open. Check his account locked out again. Unlock and clear his credential manager which just has outlook in there. He stays unlocked this time. Must be outlook causing it.

&amp;#x200B;

Me- Yeah so in the past 5 minutes without outlook closed it looks like you're not being locked out anymore lets get you a new profile and signed in to it.   
Eng- *silence*  
EU- Alright go ahead you drive.   


So I force a password sync on his computer by running a program as a different user just to make sure his computer was synced with AD. Then generate a new outlook profile. Deleted the old. Went through our MFA for outlook and emails started flowing through. Check his AD a couple more times while explaining his emails are going to slowly load in and not to worry about missing ones for now. Still staying unlocked. Engineer confirms one last time on whether we need to changed his password. No. No we do not. Please stop suggesting that. A new password doesn't fix everything.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah. Engineers. Please new passwords aren't the solution. Investigate the issue or let me investigate it and don't keep suggesting a new password.",357,0,1
"I'm sorry I'm not twilio, can't do much for you otherwise","I'm on call this week and next. That means my grump bastard ass is fixing user incidents!  
For the most part it's our service desk czar asking small things like why the Lithium battery request form isn't being approved by the hazmat approvers (because the user's manager has to approve it first. this has happened twice now). Sometimes people are sillier about what they want.

####Tuesday, 4PM. I'm mostly checked out for the day and outlook chimes.  
I have an incident.

&gt;  I am on-call and normally when I get assigned an incident it sends an SMS message to my cell phone. If I go into ${PLATFORM} and test the connection I get the SMS message on my cell phone. If I get assigned an incident I don't get the SMS message. I am currently on-call and I depend on that notification to help me be aware of issues that need my immediate attention. Please reach out to me if you have any questions about this situation. Thanks

Seems pretty straightforward. ${PLATFORM} sends texts as emails to your carrier. Emails aren't down last I checked. If they were, the service desk czar would be down my neck in anxiety.

Look up this guys phone number. Pull up email logs. Filter his number out. Exclude dates before the last successful notification. 16 messages - three tests, 13 incidents.

Pull up incidents. Filter out his. Exclude dates before the last successful notification. 13 incidents. Only thing I can think of is changing cell carriers, so I shoot him a message asking that. No response that day.

#### Wednesday, morning  
A response!

&gt; I haven't changed phone providers since the last time I got a notification. Had the same phone provider for years.

Well shit. That looks like a carrier problem. A bit of googling later, a judicious question to the senior member of my team, and yeah it's on the carrier.  The senior engineer suggests we get a Twilio account if our company doesn't already have one. I like the idea tbh, would be interesting to stand up.

But since there's nothing else I can do - email is up - just resolve the ticket, send the guy an email saying this. Apologise for things not being broken because he's a senior whatever the fuck and I don't want to deal. Tell him emails are working, his incidents register notifications to his cell number, there's nothing else we can do. And off to lunch I go.

#### Wednesday, right after lunch

Two emails from him.

&gt; Just noticed that this has been resolved. I don’t believe this should be changed to resolved. It is resolved when I get my SMS messages or so I would think. Let me know what the next steps are. Thanks

and

I have had this happen in the past where all of a sudden I don’t get my SMS notification and the ${PLATFORM} team has always been able to fix this. Are you telling me that it can’t be fixed? Is it possible to open a ticket with ${PLATFORM}. I am very uncomfortable with not get my notifications when I am on-call. Let me know if we can escalate this to ${PLATFORM} or what the next steps are. Thanks ${ME}, ${HIM}

First, no. It's resolved because I can't do anything else.  
Second, no. We aren't opening a ticket with ${PLATFORM} support. They know this is an issue, they know it's on the cell carriers. Take it up with Sprint and Cingular if you really need to.

That time a vendor underestimated how insane I am.,"setup(

I work for an IT MSP and one of our clients is this big industrial metal fab company in the middle of nowhere. They're so far out that if I'm going to be there for more than a day at a time it's cheaper to put me up in a motel overnight than pay mileage reimbursement there and back. The site consists largely of a main building with the server and network stuff in it and then a couple of smaller buildings about a quarter mile away across a dirt field where they store metal stock. This story happened around October after some heavy rains, that'll be important later.

);



loop(

The client had been reporting increasing issues where one of the machines in the shed across the field would take hours to pull down just a few kilobytes of gcode from the server when loading jobs. Nothing else in that shed had issues like that just the one machine. Whenever we talked with the vendor they'd insist it was some network or configuration issue on the Ubiquiti point to point solution that beamed the network out to the shed. We'd show them wireshark captures and ping graphs and all kinds of things proving that it was some issue in their software and that none of the other machines with the same software in the same shed had the problem. We replace the cat5 line to the machine with shielded cat6e, showed it would do it even with everything else in the shed turned off, showed the machine itself could access the rest of the network at full speed even while the software was struggling. Every time the vendor would just insist it was our point to point gear. After several months of this the client had had enough and wanted something done about it, now. The vendor asked us to try moving the machine to the main shop but the thing weighed more than a school bus and moving it would have been in the mid 5 figures. We didn't have a quarter mile worth of fiber in stock let alone the SFPs and the client didn't want to pay that much for a temporary test to prove the vendor needed to fix their shit. We were stumped until I had a brain wave. We had a pair of old desktop UPSes that would still hold a charge, some boxes of Cat5e that another client had found in a storage room and didn't know what to do with, and some little desktop switches, you can probably see where this is going. 

The next week I go onsite to enact my devious plan and discover the entire field is a mud pit now. Undeterred I find a couple of cardboard boxes and duck tape some trash bags to the bottom. I go to the server room and tape and tie the cable to the bolted down rack, climb atop some filing cabinets, pull some slack cable, and toss the entire 1000 foot box of cat5e out a second story window onto a snow bank. Anger in my heart I retrieve my box and carry it back to my car, and then idle my way into the field feeding cable out of the box all the way to about 95 meters into the field, got one of the bankers boxes out of my back seat and put a UPS and a switch in there, crimped the connections and plugged stuff in, and then continued this process all the way to the shed dropping another box about every 95 meters until I got to the machine. I get everyone ready for the test and have all of our network diagnostics running and a vendor on the line and drive my way back into mudhell to turn on the UPSes. The unhappy beeping of a choir of APCc and Cyberpowers singing in my ears we start the tests. Surprise surprise the issue is still present and our link to the office is, all things considered, astonishingly good. In the little over hour and a half it takes before the UPSes finally die the vendor finally agreed to sending out a warranty covered rep the next day who had the issue fixed in about 30 minutes. Victorious I took apart the whole mess, hosed down the cable, and went into town to buy and expense some new socks.

TLDR: Vendor tried to insist a problem with their equipment was our network, I called their bluff and burned a box of cat5e and a pair of socks to prove they were wrong.",1789,0,1
The tale of moving a server which CANNOT be powered down ... 5 miles to a new office,"I just remembered this one, and at the time it felt like just another day in cowboy IT. Now in hindsight I see it for the mad and brilliant plan it was.

The scenario: SMB who outgrew their office, and in-office datacentre, migrated to a new office building and most things out to a datacentre.

There was however, still, a few things in the old office building. And a rapidly looming 'end of lease' date by which point the office HAD to be empty.

So, we come to the problem. I don't recall the name of the server. This was around 2009 or so, and the server was a ML350. Which wasn't particularly new even at the time. This server had some crucial software that we needed for six more months.

Now, the old office only had a 2Mbps leased line, and the server had a lot of data with the software.

Of course, the office was closing in three months.

So, a review was done.

Do we attempt to migrate it the data? Well it's not needed for more than six months, at which point it can all go. It would've taken a lot of time and effort to build a replacement server and migrate the data.

Do we power it down and move it? Nope can't do that either - server is so flaky it might not ever come back up.

In comes the hero of our story. We'll call him Phil, because it seems to fit.

Phil suggests we simply move the server ... without powering it down.

""The server has two power supplies. If we take this spare rackmount UPS, and put it in the car, run a long power cord to the server, we can carry it down the stairs while it's running, and then get it in the car. We can move it while it's powered on, and get it into the new rack! Simple!""

Sounded horrendous. So of course, we got the ""let's do it!"" mandate.

This is the way this beautiful horrendous piece of IT  went down.

1. UPS sat in the car boot, with a power cord waiting for the server.
2. Using the wall sockets on the way from the upstairs server room to the car park, multiple different power cords were daisy chained into the two power supplies of the server, until a long extension lead got it out of the door and into the car boot.
3. The nerve-wracking 5 mile car ride, with a continually beeping UPS warning it's mains power is off, and spinning SCSI disks then took place.
4. The carry of the server and daisy chaining of the power cords ensued - luckily this time it was downstairs however.
5. The server was eventually situated in it's new racky home.

We didn't lose any disks, but a few people lost some hair.

Edit to add: One of the suggestions below about virtual machines reminded me. We did try to P2V it using vmware converter, and we would've obviously carried the VMDKs out on a USB hard drive or simple one disk NAS etc. We could've trickled out the data for the half hour or so for the drive and import - but the P2V failed because the Windows install was so screwed that the agent couldn't even install to start. Thus, our choices became limited.",4361,0,1
Swapping users to fix the issue,"Many moons ago I worked for a studio that created computer graphics for films. This was a place where a lot of CG techniques were invented and it grew from a small ""computer division"" to nearly 1K cg artists. In that process the company went from the front half of an industrial building to 13 buildings in an industrial park. Only 2 of those buildings were built by them, the rest were general purpose industrial buildings and had original occupants. It made for great building names, my favorite was Cookie Bay because it had been a cookie factory. We also had ""Far Away Bay"" and ""Far Far Away Bay"".

Because of the addition of many computers and workstations and people the AC systems in these buildings were kind of bodged together and added to randomly. This also led to power distribution being weird since much of the original infrastructure was removed, it was just modified. That meant things like the breaker panel that was just across the room had nothing to do with the outlet next to you, that was fed from halfway down the building.

A few of you elderly folks will remember these things called CRT monitors. We had a very large collection of 19"" CRTs for the CG artists to use. There was also a roving team of MonCal people to keep the colors proper on those. You gotta make sure your green alien was the same green on every screen.

I was a paladin of a maintenance droid, I got called in when all other techs got stumped.  This time I was called because of an issue where the image on some of the monitors was vibrating. It was a small shift that in modern terms would have been less than a pixel. But I did notice it.

They had tried swapping monitors, then cables, then whole machines. Still some screens had a case of the wiggles. Now mind you this was not an issue for all the users in that area, just a few. When we went in a night to really get into it and suss out what was going on and not interrupt production we could not find any issues. The screens were perfectly stable. The next day there would be complaints from a few users. Then they tried swapping users, this worked!

We had noticed that there were users who did not notice the slight wiggle in their screens. There were others who were very sensitive. By relocating the users and selecting for ones who did not complain about the twitchies the issue was sort of resolved.

I was still bugged about the issue. I then heard from my older bother (he was the telecom guy) that the PBX was having issues with the T1 lines feeding it. They would lose sync from time to time.  When they tried to troubleshoot it at night all would work perfectly. Then the next day it would fail. (My brain twitched)

I went to see what was up and learned that they had moved the T1 handoff from the fiber to a new server room in the building with the twitchy monitors. Those went via coax cable from the new location to the old building where the PBX was. I asked if he had used the isolation transformers for that connection. He looked at me sideways and went Hunh?

A year before this we had some video lines between the buildings and discovered a ground differential between the buildings. The quick fix were some gnarly 75 ohm transformers to isolate the 2 systems. Those did their job, but had been retired and put on the shelf. The telecom and IT teams did not communicate much with the video people so there was a knowledge gap. I am the gap filler here.

Transformers were installed and the PBX was a happy camper.

I still was perplexed by the issue. Why only during the day and not at night. Whey would it work sometimes and not others. Hmmm. 

Then it hit me... AC! (In several connotations of the term) They had all these various HVAC systems bodged on the roof with power coming from whatever panel they found extra power in. Because these units were taking power from one end of the building, but getting grounded locally there were some weird ground currents going on when all the HVAC units were running, like on a warm day. At night when testing was done the AC units were off so there was no problem.

To test it we setup one night and watched a monitor that we knew would wiggle. We then went and overrode the timers and turned on all the HVAC systems in the building. As they came on the wiggles would start.

We surmised that we were sitting inside a huge magnetic field because of all the wiring running all over the place. There was nothing to do about it short of gutting the whole place. They were in that building for a few more years and LCD monitors started coming out. Those are not bothered by magnetism. In the long run the whole company moved to a new campus. I stayed behind with the small practical unit until the place got sold. I got sold too and rode with that company until they filed chapter 7.

The evil building was eventually gutted and turned into a county medical center.

Tldr at bottom 


So I worked in this small computer shop 2016-2018 as an apprentice and this is one of the stories I can tell. 

So I was at the shop alone When a customer comes up to the shop. 

Hello sir how can I help? I ask

Yeah i need a new monitor preferably something HD. said the User.

So I show him the monitors. I can't remember the exact model but the one he liked was a AOC or ACER with A 27"" ips display which was 1080p. Honestly not a bad call. He brought his computer with him and I noticed a major problem straight away. His pc was VGA only. The monitor in question had HDMI and Display port no vga. instantly I deduced he will need either a new graphics card or a different monitor. We had a low profile gpu (think it was a gt 710 or something similer) which just came out of a pc we upgraded for a customer, it was never used outside of the shop and was going used for cheap. 

Unfortunatly sir that particular model of monitor will not work with your computer in it's current state. I said. As you can see here you pc can only output a vga output. The monitor only has HDMI and Display port. To remedy this we will have to insert a graphics card with a HDMI port. We have one on sale here for £20. 

How much will it cost? User asks. 

£20 I replied. 

I don't accept that answer. Said the user. Is there a way to do it without the graphics card? 

No way unfortunatly. I replied. I can do it for £15 with the monitor if you want. Both come with 2 year warranty. 

The guy pulls out his phone and starts googling. 

You are lucky you have it cheaper than pc world. I'll take the monitor but not the graphics card. My mate knows more than you he will get it setup for me.

Text messages can't time travel.,"I work in the medical side of things and my day to day is managing systems that track patient information for multiple uses such as a patient's inpatient history, upcoming clinic appointments, etc.

One of our systems is used to book patients into our outpatient clinics, manage their appointments and update their outcomes. It also plugs in to an external text messaging service that will automatically text the patient if their appointment time or status has changed, for example if it's cancelled.

Our team (Me) gets a support ticket from a clinic secretary (CS) reporting an issue with the text message service. Paraphrased:

CS: Hi, I have a patient who has arrived into the clinic here today but their appointment was cancelled two weeks ago. They say they never got the cancellation text but they should've been texted two weeks ago when the clinic was cancelled.

(Patient is understandably very annoyed, but this is the only report of this issue so I do a quick audit of the activity recorded against the patient's record...)

Me: Okay, I'm just going through the patient's account history. I can see today's appointment was booked a few months ago by you. When did you say today's clinic was cancelled?

CS: Two weeks ago, the consultant due to run the clinic was going on leave so we were told the clinic wasn't going ahead and we were to reschedule the appointments.

Me: Okay. And when (I ask, knowing the answer already as I can see the audit) did you actually update the patient's appointment information on the system?

CS: Yesterday evening.

Me: So not two weeks ago?

CS: No.

Me: So the reason the patient didn't get a cancellation message two weeks ago is because you didn't actually cancel the appointment on the system two weeks ago. 

(Our text messages go in batches at different times during the day, so the message generated by the record update late the day prior hadn't yet gone out.)

Me: The good news is the text service is fine and the patient will get the cancellation message today, but if you don't update the appointments in a timely fashion on the system then patients won't get the texts in time.

CS: Okay thanks.



It goes without saying that if you or someone you know does manage to invent time travelling text messaging, please let me know.",286,0,1
The server on wheels....the companies next big idea,"So I work for a large multi national tech company. I am in no way involved with this new product.

The company at the highest level recently released a new flagship product. Without ousting my company...think central server for an entire office that also prints, copies, scans, etc. More or less, they got rid of a paper tray and put a server in there instead. Revolutionary.

Anyways they are testing this new product in a remote office that I sometimes work in. One day my group is slacking off at lunch and one of the testers of this new flagship product comes over to tell us all about it and how we can put our software on this server in the machine.

This is the ensuing conversation between one of my engineers and this tester. E - engineer , T -tester.

T: so now instead of buying an Azure cloud environment they can buy this machine and host the software on prem and have everything centralized in one location. 

E: does the machine have wheels

T: of course, how else are you supposed to move it around easily 

E: so god forbid they ever get robbed and someone wheels out the 10k dollar machine and they lose their database server as well

T: (dumbfounded) excuses himself

Not really tech support. But always gives me a chuckle.",695,0,1
I didn't touch anything!,"So for the last few days I've had to go back and forth with my friend over his computer. 

He bought a new ssd and wanted to move windows to it, easy enough. 
So I talked him through it, linked him to guides and youtube tutorials and eventually got the ssd installed. 

The next day he asked me to come over to his house to fix it, I looked inside and the power cables werent connected to the drive, an easy enough mistake/fix.

The next part is where things got messy. A day later, I get a call from him saying the PC either won't boot or goes straight to bluescreen. So I troubleshoot with him, getting him to tell me exactly what was happening, retracing anything he might've done etc. 

He insists he did nothing between me being there and the PC refusing to boot. I try and get him to run disk repair and when that failed just getting him to reinstall windows. He claims he can't do either so I'm stumped. He claims literally nothing has changed so I start thinking it's an issue with the new drive itself.

The next day I agree to go over and look at it again and...

The case is a complete mess. There are cables everywhere (I'd tidied up the cables the day before). The GPU is unplugged, the network card is laying on the bottom of the case, the ssd is still plugged in properly but it's suspended in a tangle of cables and the hdd was halfway out of the drive cage. 

He starts going on about how moving the hdmi cable up to the motherboard stopped it not booting so he thinks its an issue with the gpu...
He was still adamant he hadn't touched anything.

After about 30 mins of cable management and reinstalling windows, the PC was running fine and he finally admitted he did touch something.

Turns out he tried to split the windows files between the two drives so he could fit a game onto the ssd. Then when windows bluescreened and wouldnt boot he tried what I did the day before, plugging the drives in properly, but with both the hdd and ssd.

In the process he somehow managed to pull up all the cables that were tucked away, and unplugged the GPU.

""I didn't touch anything"" seems to be something I hear all the time when going over to friends or relatives houses to troubleshoot/fix their systems. 9 times out of 10 they always have.",141,0,1
I need my printer next to me in the new office,"So this happened about 19 years ago. We had an office with a number of laser printers (think big brand with two letters one up each from GO).

We were moving the entire office of 150 staff from one place in London to a new office about 1 mile away. It started at noon on a Friday and the office was up and running by noon on Sunday with nary a problem (apart from a dead token Ring switch)

So the printers were big, floor standing with 3 paper trays and their own ""on the floor"" paper storage cupboard on casters. About 4' tall. 

The new office was all shiny and sparkly, fresh paint, carpet tiles on the floors; EXCEPT in the reception area and the strip to the C-LEVEL offices where it was very expensive laid wood strips. 

So the morning of the move and there are maps everywhere showing where departments are in the new office; and copious signage telling you that if you have IT problems to call the new IT Support Desk number and a tech would be with you in a few minutes.

Printers were automatically rolled out configured to each user on login so you'd get the printers all the printers. Each person had a guide sheet that just told them to find the nearest printer and then print to that one. Each printer had a big A3 sign on the wall with its name ""Printer XX"" and they featured on the site-map prominently.

About 10am and i'm fixing a problem in Reception. Pretty minor issue; new PABX and the receptionist wasn't used to a particular call parking feature.

Suddenly I hear a particularly nasty squeaky scratching noise. Like a heavily loaded item being pushed over wood. 

I look round the corner and there are two members of staff diligently pushing one of the printers across the office through the C-Level area, and digging nice deep runnels into the wood as the printer's caster breaks haven't been let free and the printer is too heavy.

I run over and stop them before they do any more damage and ask them what they're doing.

User: We were trying to print and our printouts were not coming out. So we went to find our old printer. So to save time we decided to move this printer back to near us.

Me: Why didn't you follow the guide sheet about printing? 

User: There wasn't any guide sheet. 

me: Every desk has a ""IT Services at the new office - read this first"" packet along with the ""Facilites Services one also"".

User: Well we didn't see those so we decided to do this. 

Me: why didn't you call the IT Support number? 

User2: We rang ""old extension number"" but no-one answered. 

Me: We're in a new office; all the phones are new and you know there are new numbers. Every desk has a note pinned to the divider that lists key contacts including the IT Service Desk.

User1; look are you going to help us with this printer or not?

Me: Please just leave the printer here and go back to your desk. Call ""new service desk extension"" and someone will come and set you up on the printers. 

User1/2: Ok well you could have made this a lot easier -- they walk off.

At this moment the CEO decides to walk through reception and sees me standing next to a printer and and big runnels in the wooden floor. 

I managed to explain things and we had in the end to get the moving company to come in with a skate and floor protectors and move the printer; plus get the flooring company back in to sort out the damage.

Not what you call a good day. 

TLDR: Users move big printer across expensive wooden flooring because they can't be bothered to read documentation in new office. Cause $$$$ damage and leave IT Manager to explain things to CEO.",175,0,1
Screaming fire in a crowded theater,"This story happened literally moments ago.

I've mentioned in the past that I'm a developer and part of my job is troubleshooting my software when someone complains or files a ticket. Two Saturdays ago, one of our contractors deleted a VM. This VM housed our only version of a real-time tool for our call queues, one for which no backup existed. This project took me multiple hundreds of hours to build out the first time using a whole host of technologies. Like a miracle worker, I fixed it by early Monday, spending 26 hours of my weekend to do it. The only difference here being that the URL changed (for various reasons that don't really matter).

Flash forward to this afternoon. I get an email from the CTO labeled high importance ""Real-time not working in Site 2"". All it says is ""CEO informed me that Real-time is not working in Site 2 and hasn't been for days"". Like the good dev I am, I made the assumption that it wasn't working and no one had filed a ticket or said anything (which can and has happened before). I ask CTO if he had any additional details his response back was, and I quote, ""No"". I end up sounding the alarm and engaging the networking, server, and operations support folks to start probing and find the problem. Ping tests from different vlans, remote accessing multiple boxes, double checking AD and the box itself... and nothing... it works just fine in every test.

After spending an hour engaging a bunch of different folks, I get a call from one of our ops support folks ""Oh yeah, I was walking around with CEO since he's at Site 2 today. I told him the real-time tool wasn't set up on our monitors yet. The URL changed and we're still setting the links back up"". I spent an hour panic hunting for a problem because CEO misunderstood something an Ops person said and complained to CTO about a problem that didn't actually exist.

The worst part of this is that I now have to tell CTO that CEO was wrong. That's not a conversation that's going to be easy or fun. !@#$ing C-levels.",573,0,1
"Customer bricks iPad, threatens legal action","First, a little context.  I (31M), work as a computer technician/salesman for a large office/school supply retailer.  It's my job to not only sell devices, but service them.  As you might imagine, my position attracts a lot of older clientele, with the most banal questions and requests.  Still, a lot of them are fairly self-aware in their lack of knowledge.  I don't mind helping them out, and if I can teach them a thing or two, everyone benefits.

Now on to the weekly feature.  Though I wasn't a part of the initial contact, a couple (let's call them Rachel and Frank) came in to replace an old iPad that had outlived its usefulness.  She was maybe late 40s, Jamaican, and he looked early 60s, Canadian.  From my understanding, they didn't want us to set it up, and they turned down Apple Care.  Can't blame them for not paying for setup, it's easy enough for seniors to do (but this has an important consequence later).  

Three days later, my supervisor Sandra (41F) mentions to me that Rachel brought the iPad back in for us to set it up for them.  ""No problem"", I said.  ""How far did they get?"" It was all set up, except...
They didn't know their PIN code to unlock it.  After heaving a sigh, she recommends we wipe it and set it up new.  While the process is going, we get their account info, as we will wind up hitting the User Account lock soon.  They gave us their Apple ID, but you probably guessed...
They didn't know their password.

That's still not an issue, it just prolongs matters.  A simple password recovery will do.  Well, that would be great, but the pattern continues.
They don't know their email password.  I pull Sandra aside for the next step.  After letting out an groan, well out of earshot, we take note that their email address is provided by their IP.  They'd have to call their IP, waste at least a half hour on hold, and get back to us with a reset password.  We send Rachel on her way, and we hold onto the iPad for when we get the call.

The next day, Sandra gets a call from Frank, asking why we can't just wipe it, and why they have to jump through so many hoops.  Where his wife was polite and understanding, Frank had a short fuse.  Still, Sandra used her charm to reassure him.  Unfortunately, his irritation was well deserved.  He had spent an hour with the IP, only to choose then to tell us...
He hasn't been with that IP for 4 years.  They scrubbed the email account, and can't do anything for a non customer.  Sandra tells him to have Rachel bring her PC in case I can reset it using iTunes.  Sandra is already gone when I get there, for her son's grad, and left me notes so I'm up to date.  At this point, I'm having to go into the lock-up so people can't hear my groaning.  I had to be straight with her.  It was hard, because she was so nice throughout this whole thing.  She can call Apple directly, or take it to the local repair centre Apple forwards claims to, but there's nothing I can do.  She asks to use the phone to call Frank.  I can see this coming a mile away, so I prep my best customer service voice and prepare to dig in.  As I predicted, he wants to speak to me.

The first complaint was valid.  We charged them for setup work we couldn't fulfill.  That'd be returned, no questions asked.  I went over the situation with him slowly, and explained the Account lock he enabled.  He explains to me that he did nothing, he didn't enter any info.  All he did was hold the iPad over his phone when it asked him to (thereby transferring the account info).  Apparently I didn't make any sense, because I should be able to just wipe it and start fresh.  After a couple more times of explaining it, he asks me ""So what are you telling me, the iPad is no good?"". ""Unless that iPad can be unlocked by Apple or by the repair center, it's unusable"", I said.

At this point, he demands a refund.  ""Yes, we will refund the labor for setup back to your wife's card"".  Boy howdy was I stupid.  He was actually asking for a refund on the iPad.  And since we never touched it, we have literally no liability for what happened.  He felt that we sold him something that he can't even use, and it's within the 14 day return period.  I explain that because he had set up the tablet with his info, that the lock is in place because he can't remember it or recover it.  Again, he says he never set it up.  Of course, denying an already irate customer a $500 refund is going to cause problems.  To paraphrase Frank, ""If you won't give me a refund, I'll talk to Sandra, or whoever the manager is.  I'll get legal if I have to."" 

I've only been in retail for 2 years, but I have enough common sense to know that when someone drops that word, you shut the fuck up, Friday or not.  I let him know that I can forward him to a manger that's in, but his wife will have to take it to the Apple claim centre or call them.  It was beyond my expertise and pay grade to represent the store if someone would be getting their lawyer involved.  I knew he was blowing smoke, but you don't fuck around with that.  I returned the iPad to his wife, refunded the labor, and gave her the directions.  She apologized for her husband, almost like she knew exactly what would happen.

And it wasn't until after she left that I clued in: Shit, he's got the same Apple ID on his phone too.  Watch him blame us for that, too.

Edit: Wow, this really blew up overnight.  I love the smell of Karma in the morning.

I'll try and work some comments over breakfast.",2209,0,1
"""Why do I need to call them? Just fix it""!","Greetings, and welcome back to another tale of tech ~~failure~~ support. Sit back, relax, enjoy a plate of grumblecakes, and please do the needful. To set the background $Me works as an L2 tech, which is to say the end of the line. My team gets tickets for $Org that were not able to be resolved by the helpdesk. If we aren't able to resolve the issue, then we will generally engage the engineers at the relevant vendor. That, or we tell the $user they are out of luck. We handle everything from diagnostics to AD administrative tasks. The way our system works is that tickets get assigned to our queue, and we have dispatchers who assign tickets to individual technicians on our team. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the cast:

&amp;nbsp;

$Me - The protagonist of this story, runs on coffee and lo-brau brand beer. He also has a cape that flutters in the breeze of a “hero-wind"" branded fan.

$Users - The sort of people who the internet usually associates with a name that starts with a ""K"" who usually want to speak with your manager.

$SDL - Service Delivery Lead. Nice guy, advocate for IT staff to the suits and c-suite manglers. 



&amp;nbsp;

As I've mentioned before in previous posts, my team is the L2 team for the $org 
 L1 helpdesk. We are a much smaller team as we only take escalations for issues that cannot be resolved by the L1 team on chat/phone. We have an internal DL that is designed for the IT staff to email when something is happening that requires the attention of my team (outages, planned maintenance, etc)

&amp;nbsp;

Scene: It's a typical Friday morning. Things are pretty slow and I'm reading TFTS while watching my queue to see if anything new has been assigned to me. Suddenly my Outlook notifications are going crazy. ""Must be a major outage"" I think to myself. Some prior knowledge, the L1 team is not to share our internal DL address under any circumstances. If a user calls in requesting a ticket update, the agent should note the caller's comments in the existing ticket and the ticket owner gets a notification. A few days ago, an agent had such a call, but instead of following process, they give the caller the email address to our internal DL. Annoying, but whatever it's fine. The agent was given a talking to and we got the issue resolved.


&amp;nbsp;

Back to the story. I check Outlook and I see a ton of emails like these:

&gt; $User1 - Hello, I'm emailing to report an issue with my home printer. It's urgent this gets fixed immediately.

&gt; $User2 - I need a password reset for (system we don't support) can someone please call me at x?

&gt; $User3 - Hi I'm trying to set an out of office message but I can't figure it out. I need someone to call and walk me through this!

All annoying, and all emails about things that should be handled by the helpdesk. Lots of emails back from $TM (our technical manager) asking for ticket numbers. Surprise, none of these people had existing tickets.
As it turns out, the one person who got the internal DL, shared it out as a way to ""get help right away without needing to call in"". This lead to a parade of Users who suddenly decided their issues couldn't be fixed by L1 and that they needed an instant escalation. To top it off, while some of them understood they needed to follow process, others got indignant and made comments that they didn't have time for a ticket and needed someone to call them right away. 

&amp;nbsp;

Long story short, everyone who needed a ticket finally got a ticket and an email was sent out as a general notification from IT from $SDL explaining that we have a helpdesk for a reason and reiterated the policy for reporting an IT issue. This all went down a couple months ago and we still get occasional emails from random users who want help for a ticket that they don't have. A little post-script to the story is that a week later, one of the other guys on my team gave his personal cell phone number to a user which lead to him getting tons of calls over the weekend after that user shared his number with her department. Nobody had any sympathy for him...

Hope you enjoyed! I'll try to upload some more stories later on from my time at $GovOrg. As always if you have any questions, comments, or death threats, feel free to post them in the comments. Later!

Working with whitelists,"A colleaugue of mine was involved in this story way back when.

The scene: It were the days of the wild west internet. Outlaw javascript popups roamed the internet without any popup blockers to play sherrif.

A certain car $company produced slightly more luxurious cars than a golf caddy could afford. (The actual name is important later)

$company asked theIT business $HavePatience to develop a whitelist solution, so $company employees couldn't surf to none-approved websites. (Be it by typo or malicious intent)
It would also autocorrect and point the user to the nearest match of the whitelist.

Due $company wanting a solution fast, someone at $HavePatience made a typo. They typed the wrong ammounts of L's in $companyName. The name with that typo was a womans name with a profession that would break rule2 if I'd mention it here.

During the demo with $companies bigshots, they ended up on a site with a ton of popups.

My colleaugue managed to fix the issue pretty fast. (When telling the story, he mentioned some jokes arround that 10 minute break, but again rule 2)

Funniest part: $company decided to buy the solution, so their employees wouldn't also make the typo.",117,0,1
Chrome won't install!!!,"I work Tech Support at a mine.  Users are not known for their computer literacy.

So I walk over and there is Chrome browser window open, with 10 or so downloads of chrome at the bottom, and an error box saying chrome is already installed on the PC....  Yeah, User was opening chrome, to download and install chrome, then complaining when the installation failed.

Percussive maintenance works...sometimes,"Many years ago one of my first jobs was working as PC tech for a college.  I had a professor come down to my office saying his laptop was making funny noises and he was unable to get it started.  He was hoping that I could get it working again.

I took the laptop; plugged it in; powered it up and heard...click-click...click-click...click-click as the hard drive attempted to spin up.  Knowing this wasn’t good, I informed the professor that the chances of his computer booting up were slim to none and we would more than likely need to replace the hard drive.  Of course...that’s when he drops the “Everything I have is on that computer.”

I knew the answer already; but still asked the question, “Do you backup your work to your network share per college policy?”  This was before USB flash drives, folder redirection,VPN’s, and other such features were common so everything was saved to the local drive.  Of course the answer is,”No, never have.”  I ask him to leave the laptop with me to see what I can do.

After he leaves and as I start taking apart the laptop to pull the hard drive a thought strikes me….just maybe….I take the screwdriver I have in my hand; turn it around so I am holding the pointy end and firmly strike the case where the hard drive is located with the back end of the screwdriver.  Miracles beyond miracle...the click-click stops and the hard drive spins up.  The OS starts and I am greeted with the login screen.  I log in with our technician account and run a few disk tools(Norton Disk Doctor or something similar) we had which “correct” the errors.

I called the professor and explained the good news(leaving out the part about some percussive maintenance) and asked him to stop by my office.  When he arrives I explain in no uncertain terms that he is extremely lucky and that he needs to back up his files as soon as he is back in his office and plugged back into the network; as I could not guarantee how much longer that hard drive would continue to run.  He takes his laptop, expresses his gratitude and promises he will back up his important files as soon as he is back in his office.

Well this is TFTS….so you know the story can’t end there….

Guess who was back in my office about two weeks later with a computer that would not boot...guess who had not backed up their important files..and one guess to who was not so lucky the second time around?

CEO is onsite and says our tech support is crap.,"I used to do phone support for a device that was in a lot of stores and fast food joints. This device would get jammed all the time. (I'd rather not say what device. And it would work great but it had to be kept reasonably clean. Which these places didn't do.) 

 I could walk somebody through clearing it in my sleep. This one store I called up (a small chain of east coast retail/fast food) had  reported a problem. 

The manager was the type I hate: she didn't want my help and didn't want to touch the device. She wanted a tech to come out. I pleaded with her to walk through clearing the device.  ""Can I call you back if you're busy? It'll just take 10 minutes."" She was extremely rude and said ""This thing is never working it jams all the time just send somebody out here"" and hangs up. Tech sent. 

He arrives onsite and clears the jam and cleans the device (crap had spilled all over it.) Takes 10 minutes. The CEO  (of the chain) happened to be doing a store visit that day. He told the  field tech ""This is why we pay you guys thousands per year? The manager could have done that and also cleaned it!"" Our tech says we called them and offered to walk through unjamming and cleaning. The store manager says no way did we do that. 

The CEO says ""I'll get to the bottom of this"" and begins an inquiry. (The field tech said the CEO was *pissed* and was talking about lawsuits if the field tech was lying. And he hopes the notes in the ticket could be backed up because we were about to lose a client and that's not on him.)  They contact my boss and they pull the ticket and the notes. They pull the recorded call where I pleaded with the mgr. to walk through some simple steps.  They read and hear everything I wrote about this rude mgr. who didn't want to help at all. 

The CEO gives a directive to every store that no one is to be rude and to help us out if we call so we can avoid a tech visit.  Every time after that when we called the  managers were very helpful to us (and it saved them a bunch of money on a tech visit.  And they kept the things a lot cleaner.)",4000,0,1

Me: Thanks for calling the service desk, I can help you.

User: Hi, my laptop will not turn on. All the lights are on but my monitor is black.

M: Ok, can I have you hold the power button down until the light goes off. After that wait 30 seconds and press it again to turn it back on.

U: Ok, done. The blue light is back on. But nothing is happening on the monitor.



This immediately sets off an alarm bell as all our laptops at this point in time have green power lights.



M: Great, thank you. Can you tell me what it says on the computer with a blue light.

U: Yes, it says APC on it.

M: Ok, that is actually your battery backup. Is there anything on your desk that says Dell on it.

U: Yes, my docking station does.

M: Great, where is your laptop?

I can't tell you until you've filled out a 27b stroke 6 form.,"I work for a large car dealership.

I've just completed a rollout of a new thin client image for our users after much blood, sweat and tears.  

I had been testing this image for a long while, and had created a test user in the system to simulate real user scenarios.  I named this user after a certain character from a movie often described as ""1984 and a half""

One of the issues I had to resolve from the old image was RDP saving the username and password of the last user, which is something we didn't want.  The settings were in place, and I thought it wouldn't remember the previous username and password, which it doesn't, but RDP does remember the last username with the option to use another account.  Due to various other fires popping up, I had to race to get this image captured and deployed yesterday (Sunday).

KD: ....this is the 4th time I call this week, I’ve spoken to the VP of IT so he’s very aware. My internet down nothing is connecting to the WiFi. We need you guys need to send a tech to replace everything. I’m good friends with the CEO do I need to get him involved to get you guys to do your job?

As she’s making my ears hurt while on her rant I’m checking the site’s Access points and see multiple devices connected to the WiFi and have internet connectivity.

Me: I’m seeing a few devices connected is there one in particular that you’re having issues with?

KD: My computer won’t let me sign in. The keyboard won’t let me type in my username. And before you even think about telling me,  I’ve rebooted the computer like 10 times, changed the batteries, and nothing is working.

Me: hmm I would like to try a few other things if you don’t mind. Can you please reseat the USB dongle? It’s possible the keyboard is out of sync

*KD stays silent.*

KD: I don’t know what that is stop talking to me in your tech speak. Just send a tech to fix the internet.

Me: KD, Wireless keyboards don’t run on WiFi. There will usually be a small flash drive that connects to the computer.

This correction angers her even more and I can hear her mumble obscenities. Reseating the dongle doesn’t resolve the issue. So as a last Hail Mary I ask her to send me a picture of the keyboard when she does, I see the issue...

**Me: KD, on the top right corner there is a notch you can move, please move it to turn the keyboard on.**

She hangs up on me and I go home. The CEO never came into the department to discuss the keyboard's internet.",3743,0,1
The tale of the PS4 and the corrupt game.,"This happened yesterday evening, and I couldn't think of a better place to post this.

I run a small gaming store in India, and we've now starting to open up. It's been close to a week since we opened, and the customer flow is decent. Yesterday, I got a call from one of my customers, and he said that the game he bought from me doesn't work (Days Gone - PS4). Of course, no details were provided until I asked.

He sent me a screenshot which showed the error. It said, ""The disc could not be read"". Since it was a new game, I was surprised. I didn't ask him to clean the disc as that often makes things worse. I had a customer spit on a disc and clean it with his handkerchief. So, I asked him to come to the store.

He bought his fat-PS4 and I hooked it up and replicated the issue. After a couple of minutes of diagnosis, I did the obvious—I ejected the disc. And...the disc was inserted upside down! I'm not kidding.

This guy had a bunch of other games on his console, so it wasn't his first time using it. Instead of trying to figure out how or why I just put the disc incorrectly and installed the game for him.

Once it was done, I briefly ran the game, showed it to him, and then shut the PS4 down. He thanked me, and before leaving he initiated a conversation. (This conversation was in Hindi, so I'm translating a bit).


$cust: What's top?

$me: Huh?

$cust: What is the top?

$me: I don't follow?

$cust: How do I know what is the top?

$me: top what?

$cust: (pointing at the PS4), the top.. which one is it?




And that's when it hit me. He did not insert the disc incorrectly. He had his entire PS4 upside down and inserted the disc correctly. After recovering from the shock, I explained how he could figure it out and also applied a piece of tape to mark the top.

The guy left, and I wasn't sure whether I should laugh or be in awe of the guy.",232,0,1
"""I should have never called you guys...""","TL;DR: Troubleshooter calls off, coworker and I assigned to one of his jobs, customer wouldn't listen to us, we ""made it worse""

UPDATE: The reason for the poor signal was a fiber terminal filled with nests of hungry ants. Read **EDIT V2** at the bottom of the post. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I work as essentially a sidekick to a fiber optic technician for a local ISP and we do service installations for residential customers along with the occasional troubleshooting job.

Yesterday our troubleshooting technician called off so my partner and I got sent out to pick up one of his jobs. Apparently an issue with the customer's IPTV service losing signal every so often. The fiber optic network terminal device that the main line connects to is responsible for converting optical signals over to copper wiring and has 1 POTS line and 1 Data port. Just so happens that the customer has phone service, internet and TV service but only the TV service is losing signal on and off. An odd occurrence but these things happen. Normally I would assume it's a router issue as it is the most common issue we face with IPTV errors. However the strength of the signal coming through the fiber to the customer's house was almost non existent, somewhere around -42dB. Our fiber service isn't supposed to work beyond a light loss of -30dB. When we splice our fiber we usually aim for no worse than -26 and even that is pushing it compared to a more typical \~ -16.

When I say the customer's service was hanging on by a thread I definitely mean you could throw a pebble at his main line and shut him down. As a courtesy we replaced the house fiber cable and respliced it to the main line in case the issue was the old fiber (it was pinched bad in several spots from where technician who originally installed it didn't use any protective wrap and jammed it under the house siding). Still had the same light reading. Here's where fecal matter hits the proverbial fan.

We pretty much got everything to the way it was when we arrived but now his optical network terminal wasn't getting any signal at all. The guy was indefinitely without service. We eventually realized the issue has to be in the lines along the poles. My partner is qualified to drive a bucket truck so I had to drive him just a few minutes away to pick it up so he could check out the poles. I found the customer to let him know we would be right back and had to check the lines elsewhere and he immediately stops me.

Customer: ""Ok so what you're telling me is this is much bigger than my house itself?""

Me: ""That's the way it seems at the moment, you're barely getting any signal to the house right now""

Customer: ""I don't get it, you guys come here, you messed with my stuff and now I have no service at all. Everything was working fine before you got here so what happened...""

Me: ""I understand, we're working on trying to get you fixed up. It looks like something's up with your line somewhere between here and the distribution pole down the ro--""

Customer: ""Why are we the only ones without service then?""

Me: *\*Trying to explain to the customer that each house with our service has it's own line coming from terminals on poles even though he doesn't seem to want to hear it*

Customer: ""I don't understand why you can't just put everything back to the way it was. Now we have nothing. We're in the dark here, we feel isolated. You took down our wifi so we can't use our cell phones. I never should have called. We dealt with the same crap from *\*rival ISP company\**, I know how this works... Now you guys are gonna reschedule three weeks from now to redo this, is that it? You all need to send someone out here who knows what they're doing. You need to send an expert or something. Everything was working before you came here. Now you touch it and everything is worse. You guys just going to leave without fixing what you did?""

In between the guy's straight faced rant to my face, I had to pretend I wasn't about to explode. I kept my cool long enough for him to finally leave me alone and let us work (you know... considering we're still not even done troubleshooting). The customer made it clear he wanted everything just working back the way it was so with the exception of the respliced fiber and a better model *media over coax* device, we put his old network terminal back in the mix and called the office to have them reconfigure it for the service they were paying for (we swapped it out for a new one earlier during the job but it wasn't getting a signal which is why his service went out entirely).

The service came back up while I was on the phone with the office and my partner and I went inside to verify everything was working. I heard the living room tv working as I approached the front door and the customer was quick to say ""everything's working guys"". We made sure internet came back up as well as phone service. I was about to say we could make sure the other four TVs were also up and running but the customer stopped me and went ""No, that's alright. Hey, I didn't mean to be a dick"" *blah blah blah, so on and so forth*.

At this point I'm thinking ""alright, this guy's ok, was just an irritated customer is all.""Before we leave my partner explains to the guy that what we did at the house would work for now but because of the poor signal in the lines it could still cause worse problems in the future. The only other problem we could pin point was a potential bad splice that may have just only recently gotten worse in the nearby terminal. My partner can run a bucket truck and even run drop lines to houses but he isn't the splicer for those types of situations. We have splicers who have to be called out to deal with issues like those. I'm not entirely certain what all my partner said to the customer but he did explain that it would eventually need to be fixed sooner or later if the customer didn't want his service to go out on him again. Even explained that it would be better to take his service down temporarily to fix the issue at its source rather than wait and risk service cutting out frequently until someone is available to fix the issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Not two hours later (afterhours) I see an email from work about a ticket from the same customer... apparently some time after we left his service went haywire frequently and affected everything, not just TV service. A pretty solid indicator that there is simply not enough light coming through his fiber yet there is nothing we can do except have the guy whose job it is to do that job. We were sent to troubleshoot the issue. If we can fix it we definitely try to do so but if we can't our job is still to troubleshoot. Which we did. But the customer apparently wanted a new tech to come out and wanted one immediately. The soonest they could reschedule a different tech was mid week next week. That wasn't good enough and he wanted it ASAP. The call center tried to help by making it earlier in the day for the same date and that still wasn't good enough. When it was all said and done, somehow it ended up being tossed back on us for Monday...

&amp;#x200B;

Just great...

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** Also worth mentioning that the existing fiber lines in the town we were working in were initially installed and maintained by the city but were acquired by my company when the city decided they didn't want to deal with it anymore. Which also means that whatever crap job they may have done with the setup became our headache. Which means troubleshooting is a lot less predictable in the area where we were.

&amp;#x200B;

*Included the light level reading we got when we first arrived at the house.*

**EDIT V2:** Had a splicer go out and check out the issue early in the morning today before our scheduled appointment to return. When we arrived he was working inside the terminal on the lines near the house. Turns out a ton of ants made nests inside, swarmed around the splice tray and chewed through the jumper cables to almost every port.

"Lesson learned: dont do favors for end users, a printing story","Let me set the stage, young OP in his early 20s taking on his first major project. My company releases rfp for a print management solution and the vendor who won the contract (we will call ricoda) will replace all our existing printer (Lex)

My scope as follow:
- replace 5000 machines across 1200 locations 
- introduce new label printing app

For those of you familiar with printers and print management, ricoda's product although cost efficient technology wise leaves much to be desired. One fundamental flaw for me when it comes to this manufacturer is how the printer communicates to the driver. Now when I solution the configuration of the printer I had to put custom paper settings on each tray to accommodate the various types of paper we use to ensure toner adhesion to the paper. Middle thick settings/alignments etc.... - all my configs and documentation has been approved by national ops. Lots of thought and revisions were made to this, something we never worried about before because our old Lex would print anything and do a fantastic job of it.

User has been escalating an issue that she wants to print legal from 2nd tray which has been specifically programmed for another function.  Conversation below has been condensed (alot!) but went something like this:

End user (eu): I understand you have a standard you need to maintain for supportabilty, but I cant use the bypass tray for legal it just doesnt work in my office. * *continues rant trying to convince me* * 

Me: * *eventually caves* * ok eu, I'll make the modification for you, but i need you to understand what your getting into. One day your printer will be replaced during a service call and ricoda printer will come as the standard config. If I make the change on the print server and a replacement printer comes in your print jobs will fail * *provide her my contact* * call me when that happens.

Eu: omg thank you, no dont worry I will just call you I totally get what you are saying.

Me: * *reiterating that if she gets new printer it will fail* *

 I complete the change, make a note in my ricoda folder in a note pad. At this point I have 3 stores now out of standard, I wanted to make sure I remembered them.

**3 years later**

I get an escalation from right at the top, trickled down through management to me. I wish I still had this email, it was the nastiest escalation from an eu I have ever seen talking shit about support, ricoda and the company in general.  Reading through it trying to understand the problem... than I see it.

""I have been printing legal from tray 2 since I got this printer, ricoda told me they wont change the config and support is refusing to change it. Support is so stupid blah blah blah""

No way... is that... check my notes... omfg it's the store I made an exception. 

I proceeded to reply to the thread directing it to eu reminding her of our conversation and admitting the mistake is on me and  nobody else. Promptly reverted the changes on the print server and informed her she must follow standard no exeptions in a stern but semi rude email.

Nobody ever responded to that thread I never got in trouble. My director did have a smug look on his face when i explained it to him. I think he enjoyed watching me learn this lesson. 

I was so irritated with what happened and reverted the changes to the other 2 locations without even informing the EU's.",612,0,1
How Our EUs Lost Their Printers,"I'm a Senior Network Engineer in a school. Teachers as End Users are typically a bit of a mixed bag, but overall everyone is really nice.

For the most part.

If something goes wrong IT-wise that causes mass inconvenience they tend to come down on us hard, even when it's not our fault. Though I guess that might be a universal thing.

In this story, however, it was our fault. We'll, not OUR fault.

Let me explain.

In our school, all of our printers are shared out from a print server. A Group Policy in our Active Directory keeps them permanently mapped to every device on our network. All of our users can send to the print queue and collect it from any printer at any time of day, using their biometric scan to log into the printers. It's a pretty good system.

One day, we had an absolute slew of emails from the end users. All of them very angry and not particularly nicely written. If I had to guess I would say at least 60 in a ten minute period. We were even getting emails from students.

The printers weren't working.

Whenever anyone sent anything to print, it would save as a PDF instead of going to the print queue. It sounded like the default printer on their machines had changed from our queue to Adobe PDF.

Okay, that's weird. But not too hard to resolve. So I start emailing as many back as possible, explaining to them how to change their default printer. At the time I was a normal engineer, so I was front line. In the background the Senior Engineer was working to figure out what was causing the problem.

Then I started getting emails back saying that they couldn't change the default printer because the queue wasn't there as an option.

What the hell is going on?

I check my own machine. No queue.

Huh?

I turn around to the Senior Engineer and say: ""What the f*ck? Is there something wrong with the policy? The printers are missing from my machine too.""

At this point the Senior Network Manager walks in.

""Whats up lads? Busy one today?""

""Mental. The printer queue is gone.""

""What?""

""Yeah, gone. It's like the group policy has gone wrong.""

I then notice a weird look on the Manager's face, when I mention the group policy. So I ask him what's up.

Turns out he had been going through our group policies that morning, for a project he was working on.

Live.

Yes, you read that right. He was making the changes live.

He didn't make a temporary offline policy, in its own group, to test things. He just started f*cking with policies live.

The Senior Network Manager. Been working in IT for 20 years.

EDITING GROUP POLICY LIVE!

He'd caused a conflict that unmapped our print queue. It had also temporarily allowed student users to access command prompt.

To this day I have no idea what he had been trying to do, to cause those two changes.

He spent 2 hours rolling back his changes, because he couldn't remember exactly what he'd done. 

In that time we had over 100 emails about the printers not working. Despite sending an All Staff email explaining that they were temporarily offline.

Because that's the one thing you can count on with end users. No matter how nice they are, they won't read an email from IT explaining a problem.",188,0,1

Me: Sure can most likely we'll just need to update the password on your phone. Are you using the Outlook app(the only thing we support for mobile devices) or your phones default email app?  
EU: Outlook  
Me: Alright so when you open it up does it prompt you to update your password or anything?  
EU: It did but I cancelled out of it and don't know how to get it back up.  


Now I am not the biggest fan of Outlooks mobile app. Probably because I just don't use it myself so haven't had the time to figure everything out with it. But I try and most of it is really self explanatory I believe. However this may not be the easiest process for updating a password but it's how I do it ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Alright well  we will need to remove your account then and add it back. Can you swipe from the left and open the settings?

Insert 5 minutes back and forth me trying to explain how to swipe in from the left, what the setting/gear/however you describe it icon is and where to find it and getting almost nowhere. Finally EUREKA he finds the settings icon.

Me: Alright go ahead and click on your account that says Office 365 for me. And at the bottom hit delete account.  
EU: Done. Now it's asking me to put in my email address and add account.  
Me: Yep, so go ahead and fill that out after clicking add account it should redirect you to our SSO page to login on.  
EU: No it tells me it can't add this account right now.  
Me: Trying adding it again with your other form of email address.(We have like 15 different username/email address combos for people this was one of them. Usually their default one was working but occasionally it messes up so I figured this was the case)  
EU: Nope still giving me the same error that it can't add it right now.  


Once again insert this going back and forth for about 5 minutes having him restart the app and phone and check his settings to make sure his email isn't logged in to his phone as well directly.  


Me: Just to make sure you are connected to WFi correct?  
EU: I don't have that. Just this antenna thing you guys gave me for my laptop.  
Me: So you are just using data on your phone and not connecting to any wireless network?  
EU: Correct  
Me: I don't suppose you have the only carrier I would ever refuse to get do you?  
EU: I do.  
Me: Well unfortunately they don't allow you to use data while you are on a call so I'll have to have you do this on your own. It should be pretty straight forward. After you end the call go ahead and try to add your account again. If you have any issues call me back.

Don’t forget to plan for the details,"Several years ago I was working for a large health system and we were undergoing a complete overhaul of their medical records system and implementing electronic medical records and digital charting. As part of this process we needed to deploy over 1,000 computers to patient rooms and nurses stations, and I was on the hardware implementation team. 

One day about midway through preparation and just 1 week before we were set to start rolling out wall-mounted computers and monitors on arms, a senior project manager invited me to start attending some meetings surrounding the deployment. At this point, I was just a ground-pounder but I was pulled in because my boss had been fairly incompetent at his job (a whole different story) - so they wanted me who knew more about the project, scope, etc. 

I remember walking into the meeting with some higher ups, the senior project manager, and my boss, and they were going over the specs of each room setup and all of the equipment that was required to be put in place. Basically, each setup was to get a PC mounted on the wall, a monitor mounted on an articulating arm, keyboard, mouse, USB barcode scanner (for scanning bedside patient wrist bands), and a USB proxima RFID badge reader so staff can login and out seamlessly with SSO. They would run one 15 foot USB-A-to-B from the PC to the monitor so that the peripherals could be plugged into the monitor. Keyboard and mouse were on a tray directly below the monitor, RFID badge reader was mounted in the top right corner of the keyboard, and barcode scanner had a bracket mount behind the monitor.  

I sat there for all of 10 seconds and thought about it, and then chimed up and asked how they would hook 4 USB devices to a monitor that only had 3 USB ports.

Everyone’s face got stark white and people looked confused but very panicked at the same time. Not one person in the room had thought of it before I brought it up and there was only 1 week until mass deployments.

I wish I had a camera in that moment.  I can just picture everyone’s panicked faces with me smiling in the corner at the camera, lol. 

Overall, that pretty much summed up my experience on that project and I still laugh at that to this day. 

Needless to say, they then proceeded to order 1,000 USB hubs which we ended up velcroing to that back of the monitor - a nice extra point of failure...but that’s all they could get in a pinch. 

My boss eventually got fired before Go-Live, and I left that job shortly after Go-Live and moved on to better opportunities.

Not reading your report to you,"First time here, etc. 

While not tech support, I spend a lot of time as pre-tech support and keep some pressure off our help desk by sitting as frontline for our sales folks. 

This was several years ago.

Language Barrier + Stubbornness = CHAOS.,"Lack of details due to hyper specific issue. Could get me in trouble, etc.

I contacted one of my customers recently about their site being offline. It turns out the site is setup irregularly, almost like it was all slapped together, then knotted, then put in a blender. *I knew I was in trouble after a bit of investigation.* But as long as I get someone who can follow simple instructions, it would ACTUALLY be an easy fix. Almost a 3 step process. Would take 10 or so minutes right?

Wrong. ***So, so wrong!***

This person, I cant quite tell their accent, cannot really comprehend basic instructions. I mean as basic english as it can get. This includes numbers between one and ten, and basic colors.

This results into incorrect cords being unplugged, knocking other systems offline, including Security Cameras, PoS, and their actual internet. Nothing I can say can fix it, and because they claimed they did *exactly* what I told them to, when I know *beyond a shadow of a doubt* that they did not, I have no idea what they touched, so now I reaaaaally cant fix their original issue, as other things are now going haywire.

After going back and forth for a week, I desperately ask, as politely as possible if there is anyone else who can assist me. They said no. (Which is impossible if I might add) And refused to hand the phone to anyone else.

This site hounded me for weeks, and we had to do an unorthodox software side fix, that is a real, REAL PAIN. And told their boss (who contacted us as to why it wasnt fixed) to call us next time they want to permanently fix the issue, as they were being no help.

That was several months ago. No contact since.

Software update goes out. This site contacts us again. ""We have issues"" after investigating for about an hour, seeing what was wrong, it dawned on me. ***These are the same people I dealt with a few months ago.*** Existential dread set in, I contemplated where my life was going, why has god put me on this ticket again? What have I done to deserve this?

This time their boss wants us to send someone out to fix it. Too bad that they have to pay for that, and he likely wont be able to fix the issue. (He may be able to, but who knows because due to serious communication issues, the site could be in any particular state and I wouldn't know)

And now. I wait. I wait for the storm. I wait patiently for bosses to get involved. I covered my ass and tried. There is not much else I can do.

The users grammar is truly that bad. Also, I am level 1.5 support, this is something that our Level 1 desk was not able to resolve..

TLDR at bottom.

ME: Hi User.

User: hi

Me: How can I help you today?

User: As per my email I sent, I am in a meeting right now. Can you reach out to me at   3? 

Me: Okay. That will work

User: ok

Me: Hello

User: hi

Me: So I spoke with the other tech about the issue. However, can I get your side of this?

User: Something happened that there are now two copies of my Documents Dir one in my user folder and another one on my PC.    did not do this. Both have short cuts in them.  having two copies is not filling up my hard drive.  I would not have made another copy of my Documents folder on my PC.

User: Why would this happen?  Why are there short...

Me: Where on your PC were all the documents located at? Were they on your Desktop?

User: no

Me: Where were they at when they got ""Duplicated""? 

User: you need to set up a session with me so I can show you this..................

Me: Ok, I just need your IP address.

User: can you see the two folders??  

Me: They are the exact same.

User: yes, but I did not do this..

Me: They are not duplicates though

User: no, this is what I need help with,

User: I don't want to delete folder over the another now know what what happened Having is taking up much space on my hard drive

User: what happened???

Me: Nothing happened. They are not different folders, they are the same exact folder. The File path just looks different because of how you are accessing it.

User: why are there short cuts in both fplders...

Me: As you can see, the location is the exact same

Me: Who told you that?

User: both of the people before you.  Now I am confused, so one my hard drive its full largely because one the size of of Documents folder.  Why am accessing it this way and can it be changed.  Its weird becaue I thought i has space on my hard drive.

Me: I am not sure why you are accessing your files that way. That is something that is your personal choice and not something anyone else can control. If you looking to free up some hard drive space, I can send you the self-service article that we have available on how to clear up Hard Drive Space.

User: I did not set it up to access my Documents folder this way.  What's what I am trying to explain.  I did not set up these short cuts

Me: No one else set up those shortcuts ma'am. I checked your Backups for the last 45 days and everything is consistent across the board. Nothing has changed.      

User: The short cuts were not there before in my Documets folder

Me: Then delete the shortcuts.

User: I will do it now but I hope your correct

Me: There you go. Is there anything else i can assist you with today?

User: just to check: this is the folder that is backed up: C:\\Users\\%Username%\\Documents 

Me: Yes

User: Its still not clear to me why this happened I did not set up this shortcut

Me: Like i said, No one put the shortcut their and it has been their for least 45 days.

User: I did not add it..why would I

Me: That is not a question I would have the answer to

User: something happened I did not add it

Me: Are you referring to the shortcut %Username% that is on your desktop?

User: no the one that was in my Documents folder that I deleted

User: again something happened and that's what concerned me.  an update push to my machine?????? I don;t know

Me: I am not sure. Like I said earlier, I do not have an answer to that question.

Me: It is just a shortcut though. Nothing to be concerned about.

User: I have been asked if I want a new PC something to do with this??????

Me: Who asked you that?

User: I got an email asking if I want a new one

Me: That is part of the PCRefresh program. That has nothing to do with a shortcut..

User: I don't know.  I have not asked for a new one

User: I did not create this short cut 45 days ago

Me: They are just refreshing older PCs.

User: yes, I know but I am at home I I don't think this is a good time to get a new PC.  maybe later

Me: Okay. Well that is your choice and no one else's. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

User: no thanks

Me: Have a great day and if you have any furthers questions or issues. Please contact the Service Desk.

Zoom Doesn't Work For Me,"After 3 months of working from home, a user just now put in a service request for my team to help her with Zoom. She claimed ""It's just not working. I don't think I have it installed"". Three months of working from home with bi-weekly web meetings, but somehow Zoom isn't installed? Color me intrigued. This morning, I set up a remote session with this user and found that Zoom was not only installed and configured, the user had no idea what a webcam was. Lovely. I opened Zoom and told her she was set for her 11am meeting. All she needed to do was make sure her audio was working. This is what followed:

USER: *""I heard the ringtone, but when I test the microphone, I do not get a replay.""*  
ME: *""Do you have a webcam?""*

USER: *""Heck, I don't know. Lol""*

ME: *""Do you see yourself in the meeting, or do you have a little camera sitting on top of your monitor? If not, you won't be able to speak in the meeting.""*

USER: ""*I do not have a little camera and I do not see myself in the meeting. Lol* *""*

ME (saddened by all of this): ""*Okay then. We can get you a webcam. I'll put in a ticket for that.""*

"Turn it off, then turn it on again.","So finally I have my own epic I can share. I've been working IT my entire life, but I finally have an actual job in IT that pays me, instead of just as a hobby. My team is small, just me, the local owner, and a few contractors we call on sometimes for projects. The company itself is nation wide, but I'll be following OPSEC and all of that, no names. 

One of our clients we've had for years works with Macs. While they aren't my strong suit, I'm actually one of the few techs in our company (the only one locally) willing to work with them. I'm a faster learner. So I've been able to tackle issues they've had that no one else would touch, with little to no support on our company's slack channel, using google and my brain. Things actually went pretty well, until we ran into an issue with their cloud storage and backup provider.

They've used this provider for years, and haven't had any issues, but one day all of their files and folders that contained special characters were renamed into gibberish. I called the support team for the backup provider and together we tried to get to the bottom of this. I then discovered the issue was only on a certain account, so I decided to remove the account but an error occurred, causing the account remain logged in on some machines, but won't show up on the backup device's local user list. 

To make matters worse, now all of the accounts were showing this corruption. The backup tech had to escalate it to their senior techs to forcefully remove the account, but the corruption remained. She figured it was a communication issue with SMB, so I tried connecting the drive via AFP instead. It actually worked, no more corruption, all files maintained their original names. She changed the communication protocol so SMB connected computers would stop seeing the corruption, but it wouldn't retroactively rename the files back, so the client decided to remain on AFP.

However now another issue was rearing it's ugly head. Crush one bug, see two more. All computers were connected to a single user on the NAS drive. None of the others were working, which creates a bit of a security logging issue, as well as the owner needing access to an admin drive. I would log them out of the drive, re-log them in as a different user, but it would say ""unable to connect to 192.168.#.#."" but would automatically reconnect if someone clicked on a shortcut link, however as the single working user. 

I reached out everywhere I could trying to figure out how to solve this issue. The backup techs closed the ticket as it was now out of their scope, they were stumped anyways, I tried various fixes on google, I found a mac expert in our company who advised me to try clearing the keychain access, but nothing was working. 

By now, it's been almost two months. The client calls again, understandably frustrated. The gibberish is back. Somehow, one of their computers reconnected via SMB. It's an easy fix, I just connect it back to AFP, but they're wondering why there isn't a fix yet for the account issue. I tell them I'm working with our national techs to find a solution, but it's hard to reproduce this issue since they are literally the only ones coming across this bug. They want to move to PC in the future, understandably. 

A few days later, I receive another call that they can't even log into that single account anymore, it instantly boots them out. I'm about to have an aneurysm, they've already threatened to just cancel service and move on. If they can't even connect to that single account anymore, it has to be an issue with the NAS. I call up the backup tech support again, but this time I request a new ticket, figuring a fresh set of eyes might help. 

He removes all the permissions on the accounts, re-add them, and restart the NAS. There was a minor hiccup with one of the admin accounts not being able to be given permissions, but after a forceful adding on the senior level, it was added.

Somehow, after months of troubleshooting, simply restarting the NAS fixed literally everything. Accounts could log in again, the admin account had admin access, even connecting via SMB didn't produce renamed files. None of us know exactly why this worked, none of us know why we didn't think of restarting it sooner (overthinking is a real danger, kids), but all of us are happy this issue is finally resolved. 

If anyone wants to rewrite this for me in a more exciting and fun to read manner, please do! I put this under unsolvable problems solved by pure luck.",168,0,1
USB port? Never heard of it...,"M - Mum
F - Mum’s Friend

So F was trying to apply for a job. Then out of nowhere M gets a call from F. F is panicking, she can’t upload her CV from her usb. This being important, M decides to visit F and also brings my brother (I would’ve gone as I’m the tech-support for my family but was busy). So, when you have a storage device failure you would think it’s corrupted or it hasn’t been partitioned and it’s literally stored as unused space (unused space can’t be used as it hasn’t been given an address for the data to be sent to). Now I don’t know how this happened or how motivated she was but the reason why her usb wasn’t working was because she forced it into the Ethernet port. Well after the simple fix she was able to upload her CV.

Really should have seen that coming...,"So our facility is in the process of a ""covid induced overhaul"".

Naturally there's a few ""it worked fine before it was moved"" legacy hardware nightmares going on.

One of those legacy nightmares (running Windows XP ""do not install service pack!"") decides it's time for a ""boot device failed"" routine, fair play it wasn't detecting the hard drive, further fair play the drive would spin up for all of three seconds then park.

That's either a dead drive or PSU...
Swap the PSU for a known good(ish), nope, no change.

Wait, it's an XP machine there's no way that bios battery still has any life in it.

So, rootle through the settings to discover that the mobo is one of those transitional monstrosities that *had* SATA ports but didn't actually want you to use them, i.e. you had to dig through multiple levels to find the SATA setting and change it from ""auto"" to ""IDE mode"" before it'll recognise the drive.

Job done, reboot the computer, recognises the drive on post...  ...   ...    ....
""Boot device failed""

Now what...

Then an operator strolls over seeing me peering into the side of the case.

""I already tried the other plugs and it didn't make any difference""

...

Me ""do you know which one it came out o- actually forget it, go an' grab me a CR2032 out of stores.""

It's in IDE ""mode"" isn't it, so all I need to do is figure out which port is SATA0 and we should be in business.

"""I have to enter ALL of these codes!?""","I'm in charge of the MSP side of the small IT company I work for. We offered users the ability to have remote access to their workstations we are monitoring with our RMM software, but until a few months ago we only had a few that utilized it. Since it was just a few people remoting into their own machines we allowed them to choose weather or not to use two factor authentication on their remote user accounts (not my choice). We are located in Michigan so when the governor locked the state down, suddenly we had a huge influx of people wanting remote access to their workstations. Almost overnight we went from around ten remote users to over a hundred, so I decided it was too much of a liability for us to allow people to opt out of 2FA any longer. I typed up an email explaining what 2FA was, why it was important, that it was no longer optional and starting the 1st of April it would be activated for every remote user account and that everyone would need to download Google Authenticator . I went through the process of setting up 2FA on an account to use as an example and took screenshots of every step with big red arrows on where they needed to click and exactly what they needed to do and attached it to the email. 

The day after I made the change, I get a call from a user freaking out saying that she can't keep up with all of the codes and she doesn't know how she is supposed to get anything done when she just has to sit there trying to enter codes all day. I asked her to elaborate on the issue and she said that Google Authenticator was giving her a bunch of different codes to enter. My first thought was the account wasn't added properly which resulted in multiple instances of the same account appearing in the app, something that has already happened to a couple users. I asked her how many accounts she sees in the app and she says just one, but the code keeps changing. Then it dawns on me, she thinks that she needs to enter EVERY CODE that the authenticator app gives her. Sure enough she had written down HUNDREDS of six digit pins throughout the day and thought she had to keep track of them. She was quite relieved when I explained how it actually worked and that the codes refresh every 30 seconds. She had a good sense of humor about it and actually kept the paper she wrote the codes on to show me the next time I went out there so we could have a good laugh.

User thought she needed to write down codes generated by Google Authenticator and wrote hundreds down before calling to ask what was going on.",1701,0,1

One button to rule them all,"So a while back i was working the internal helpdesk for a goverment agency. This meant pretty much only inhouse support and while we had a plethora of obscure or custom systems to support, the users were pretty much all inhouse people. For those who has worked with end customers you might imagine what a relief this is. Yes, i still had to uphold the professional and serviceminded attitude but with no paying customers to talk to, the pressuare is WAY down.

The downside is that withing the government sector, some people have been working there for way too long. In short: there are still nutjobs and people who should not be allowed to use computers.

One day i get a call from a lady who want's to report ""My thing isn't working"". Ok... after about 10 minutes i finaly figure out what ""thing"" we are talking about. She can't scan documents on her flatbed scanner. Some questions and some prodding and poking later i figure out it's a new computer, and she hasn't run the installation from the software center. Another 10 minutes of arguing over why she needs to do this i finally get her to do it. Problem solved...

So at this job, the call allocation worked in such a way that if the same person called again, he or she would get to talk to the same tech who handled the last call if that tech was available, even if that tech wasn't next in line for a call. So 5 minutes later i get a call. Same lady.

""Not working like it should"". Another round of prodding and poking and voilá, USB cable isn't attached. Ok, that being done, problem solved, right? I hang up and sigh deeply.

Another 5-10 minutes go by and i get another call. Round 3. Sure enough, the software isn't working. I fire up the remote desktop and set up her software to use the correct scanner (NOT the webcam of the laptop). We do a few test-scans and it all works. The scans look fine, they save OK and she can use them in her case files. All good. Finally, DONE!

I get another call, and sure enough. Hello lady! She's not happy with all she steps she has to take. I figure out she's actually closing the software between scans. This software takes a ton of time to start so i get why she's annoyed, but also inform her that she doen't have to do that. She can just keep it open. And on we go into 15 minutes of ""How can you call yourself a professional when you don't even know that you're supposed to shut down software""... A lot of If's and But's later we agree that she CAN in fact keep it open.

Another 15-20 minutes go by. I take some other calls and then WHAM. Que Eminem: Without me soundtrack. Still too many steps. Still to much work. Still not simple enough.

We are litterary talking about 4 clicks from desktop to having a saved image. But she's not happy with that. I explain to her that that's the way it works. There is no way for me, or anyone else, to make it any simpler. Also i explain that this is the way it works for our OTHER 7000 employees and they´re not having problems so the system is fine. Maybe i got a bit snarky at this point, but i was REALLY trying not to. She begrudgingly hangs up.

Another 15 minutes go by and oh boy... It's the ghost of fixes past.This time she tried to pretend i was someone new, and that ""the other guy"" she had spoken to was rude, unhelpfull and didn't want to fix it. And that was my last straw. I asked her straight: What do you want?! And she proceeded to tell me: ""I want the button on my screen to just do what i need when i press it"".

I was a bit confused by this i must admit, but just to clarify i asked:So you want ONE button, that when pressed does whatever it is you want done at that time?"" The answer was simply ""Yes"". To further clarify: ""So you want ONE button, that everytime you press it does whatever it is you need? Scan documents, copy paste text, edit files and so on?""

""Yes""

I said thank you, have a nice day and hung up. I then told my colleagues that there is no way in hell i'm talking any more calls from that number and went on break for the next 30 minutes. No F-ing way am i dealing with this anymore.

Later my boss called me in due to a ""complaint"" where i got chewed out for not solving the problem. I told the story, and by the time i got out of his office half of my colleagues was standing outside snickering. We all walked back to find the newest member of the team trying to explain to a lady how he can't reprogram windows to do ""that many things""... I kinda felt bad for him, but only between bouts of laughing my ass off.

1. &amp;#x200B;

Received an email from the mother of a next year student having problems with setting up her kid’s account for our online learning system. In addition to the web interface this also has apps for iOS and Android - one of the little quirks of the system is that new accounts need to log in with temporary login data via a browser first, and set a new safe password... only than can they use the app on mobile. To be fair, each new student receives a welcome letter, which includes step-by-step instructions for doing exactly that, complete with the login data - so what could go wrong? I called her back - you already know where this is going:

&lt;mother&gt; „I get an error message when following your instructions for setting up the account!“

&lt;joe&gt; „Are you trying to set it up in a browser, or the app?“

&lt;mother&gt; „The app on &lt;kid‘s&gt; phone... why?“

&lt;joe&gt; 🤦🏼‍♂️ (though honestly, not really since this is so commonplace that it‘s the first question I ask)

A student showed up in my office this morning with a cracked screen on his iPad. Didn‘t look too major at first, but the device registered no more inputs, so a little more pita than usual. He said it was fine when he put it in his bag this morning.

&lt;joe&gt; (notices that the iPad is not in a (mandatory) case) „So, it happened on the way to school. Was it in its case when you put it in your bag?“

&lt;student&gt; „Err... it may or may not have been in its case...“

&lt;joe&gt; (temporarily lost for words)

&lt;student&gt; „The case broke a few days ago...“

The screen registered no inputs, so no way to even check things like the backup status, or allow the USB-connection to a Mac... the battery was at 33%, so it probably wasn‘t plugged in overnight.

&lt;joe&gt; „When did the last backup happen?

&lt;student&gt; „Err... I don‘t know, maybe a week ago?“

We checked via the web interface for his Apple ID... the last backup happened in January...

So anyways, I reset the iPad via DFU-mode and sent it in for repair. 6 months of data gone and the unecessary cost and work involved with the repair, because no case.

After some poking about, I can see video locally, but the internet ports are closed and the WAN IP looks a bit odd for the ISP..... Check the router and its set up properly for port forwarding. I ask the client if there were any changes to their internet. ""Nope, say them, no changes""

Time to call the ISP. In the course of verifying the account the CSR says ""this account is not active, it was set to hold back in March (when the business was shut for Covid)""

End of the story, account was reactivated, WAN IP was their static IP and the ports were open. Client was a chagrined  ""Oh, I kinda remember doing that, but since I was still able to check email I thought the ISP didn't put the hold on the account"".  ISP out the goodness of their hearts allowed business accounts  the get/send email on their accounts that were suspended pending reopening after isolation times.",429,0,1
I demand a refund and I want my FREE SHIPPING back too!!!!,"Yes, you read correctly. Customer wants his Free Shipping refunded. Here is the backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

I work for a company that sells a very specific aftermarket upgrade for vehicles. They are vehicle specific parts, not a standard kit or 'one size fits all' type of deal.

We are very specific in our listings, to help people get the correct fit for their vehicle. Unfortunately, sometimes when people are shopping online, their endorphins kick in, because they are spending money, and they look at so many different options, by the time they purchase, they have viewed several different products, and are on information overload. This leads to people buying the wrong kit.

Fast forward to 3-5 days later when their eagerly awaited item arrives, and that is where tech support comes in. If you just READ the enclosed paperwork, it tells you everything you need to do to get this installed. I'd say 75% of our customers do not read the enclosed paperwork. They just call us and start complaining about everything, blah blah blah. I call these types of people ""Job Security"".

Now on to my Customer Of The Day. This happened Monday. I will refer to myself as TSG-Tech Support Genius, and our idiot as SC for Stoooopid Customer.

TSG: Thank you for calling random parts place, how may I assist you.

SC: Yes, I bought this kit for my XYZ vehicle and it doesn't fit my car. This is total bullshit. It is supposed to be Plug and Play and it's NOT.

TSG: I am sorry to hear you are having issues Sir. May I please have your order number so I can see what it is we are dealing with. (Gives me order number)

""Yes Sir, I can see why you are confused. This kit is not a Plug and Play.""

SC: THATS FUCKING BULLSHIT!!! YOUR AD SAYS PLUG AND PLAY! I WANT A REFUND RIGHT NOW!

I pull up the complete listing, and email it to the customer, and highlight the part where it clearly states in the ad ""This is NOT A  PLUG AND PLAY"".  I offer tech support to help him get this installed, but he is not having it.

SC: That is NOT what I ordered. This is NOT what my listing said. I want my money back right now. And I want my FREE SHIPPING refunded too!

TSG: I am sorry to hear you wish to return your item. I have approved your return. Once you ship the item back to us, I will refund your purchase price in full. However, I have no way to refund something for which you did not pay.

SC: Someone paid for that shipping, and I am entitled to it for all this bullshit you have put me through!""

Yes, we are at fault because you can't read. How's that working out for you??? I would love to tell him he is stupid, but I cannot. I assured him he would get a refund of his purchase price and that was all I could do. When I ended the call he was still bitching and moaning to someone in the background about how stupid WE ARE.

Quite frankly, if he is too stupid to know what he is buying, he is too stupid to install it and we don't want him using our product anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading. I needed to vent.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: The customer had to pay to return this. We only issue return labels if there is a manufacturer's defect, or we screwed up. The fact that you do not read the listing and cannot follow directions, costs you out of your own pocket if you want your money back.  I have to admit I took a little bit of pleasure knowing this.",1909,0,1
Massive IT Outage???," Yesterday morning  
 

EU: Hey, so while I’ve got you, I am unable to call my client. Can you help?  
 

Me: Uh oh! Yeah sure I can help. What happens when you try to call them?  
 

EU: It doesn’t ring! Once I tried to call her and I waited for two or three minutes, then it rang only once and hung up on me.   
 

Me: Two or three minutes, yikes! Are you having trouble calling any other clients? Or just her?  
 

EU: Just her.   
 

Me: Hmm, seems like a problem with her line then. Are you able to call her from your cell phone?  
 

EU: Let me try!   
 

EU: Same thing! It doesn’t ring her phone.  
 

Me: So yeah, it’s definitely something to do with her line.   
 

EU: Oh ok. I thought it was some kind of massive IT outage or something. ACTUALLY, she did mention she was having issues with her carrier. Do you think that’s it?  
 

Me: 😐 Yup almost certainly. You’ll have to get her on another line if you need to talk to her on the phone right now.  
 

EU: Oh ok. Thanks!

Its not the PC thats broken its the wifi even though PC is the only thing that can't connect,"User: my work laptop won't connect to my phones wifi

Me: okay let try to connect other thing to the phone wifi

User: i tried to connect to my personal phones wifi and it doesn't work either.

Me: okay try connecting other things to your corporate cell phone

User: no, why wont you help me.

Me: if the PC isn't connecting to either cellphone, the issue seems to be with your PC not the Phones, please contact IT for PC support. I dont have any access to PC support stuff.

User: okay

------the next day----

User: IT says you are wrong and there is nothing wrong with their laptops they've built.

Me: okay let's test again, connect any device in your house to your cell phone thats not your corporate pc

User: they all connect except the work PC

Me: okay thats a PC issue, ill talk to the IT person you are talking to

-------window with IT tech user worked with----

Me:The only thing thats not connecting to the wifi from the cell is the PC

IT 1:Then its cell phone thats broken.

Me: Hmmm, I dont think so. Every other device; personal pc, personal phone, their roku connects and the cellphone and it is only a month old.

IT 1:Cell phone is broken.

Me:Ummm, I think there is something wrong with the PCs build

IT 1:No that PC is a newer pc its a XXXX build

Me: Well everyone that has that XXXX build seems to have this issue.

IT 1:How would you know? You aren't really in IT, you only support cell phones, You don't know, look, your PC is YYYY and needs to be replaced.

------another window-----

Me: IT 2 how have you fixed user's problem before since so many are having this issue

IT 2: we had to change the password to something that is more a common word instead of a randomly generated stream

Me: thats horrifying, I guess I'll have them try it

IT 2: user might have to have the PC forget the network and reconnect and may need to change the password next time they want to use the hotspot

-----group chat with User and IT1----

Me: please change the wifi password to a plain word

User: wow that worked.

IT 1: see why couldn't you help her in the first place? It was a cellphone issue.

User: so do I have to change the password everytime

Me: I am not sure, you shouldn't have had to change the password in the first place since every other device could connect, theres an issue with your pc. This is just a bandaid and if it breaks again we will need to troubleshoot further, please let me know and we will have to face it when we get to it.

IT 1: Maybe you should just replace her phone.

------

Me: I think there is something wrong with XXXX build and I think there is something wrong with IT 1

IT 2: its possible...


I am not trying to get into a pissing contest with this dude, I just want the users pc fixed. This seems to be an issue with the new build they are putting on the laptops. IT 1 and several other people just tell me to buy them a stand alone Hotspot when this happens instead of fixing the issue with the PC. I dont want to add extra cellular lines, extra cost to the monthly bill, and extra 2 year contracts needlessly when you can change some setting. As the tech in facilities, i have to watch my spend especially when its redundant, unlike IT who has a blank check since it comes out of a different segments budget. Fix the issue and have it deployed to all PCs instead of this broken setting lurking in all the newly deployed PCs and having to put a band aid and doing a work around every time the user wants to use the internet.",205,0,1
Custom 'build' horror story,"This isn't really generic 'tech support' but I remembered this interaction today and I thought I'd share.

So, technically I work in retail, but we do a lot of over the phone and in-person tech support for folks (it isn't 100% formal, but people in my position at this place know about common issues with custom computer builds and networking problems and other issues).

A few months back I get a call from a customer who is having problems, and he says his new build isn't posting. I start having some email correspondence with him, which takes forever as he takes anywhere from 5-10 hours to respond to my emails, and he 'didn't have time for a long phone call'.

I go through the general issues with him, like PSU cables being plugged in and I also guide him through a CMOS jump to see if it's maybe that he didn't plug in his FPIO correctly or something. Still nothing. 

I ask him what parts he has and he sends me a list. I finally realized... I probably should have asked him what parts he had first. Rookie mistake on my part. He was trying to use an AMD chip with an H370 board... Not sure how he thought the two were compatible.... Nor how he actually got the chip into the board at all...

I ask him about the pins on his processor. He says they're pushed flat now, shouldn't they be that way?

I facepalm internally and have to go about explaining to him that his processor and motherboard aren't compatible in the slightest.

As things go, the guy blows up on me, saying he didn't have any way of knowing. This is true. He didn't buy the parts at my workplace, so he didn't really have anyone guiding him through it. I suppose he didn't really do much research either, which is crazy to me because one Google search would show anyone it's an Intel board. I also deduced from what he'd said that he had his EPS cable plugged into his GPU... Hopefully it's still okay. I never found out.

I arrange for him to pick up new parts and he begrudgingly agrees with me that our certified techs should build it (really, they should have taken this issue, but they're a wee bit understaffed atm). Oh, the tragedy. 

After this I never heard anything else from the guy but damn I hope he got a working computer.


I see a lot of missteps with custom builds but most are minor, like subpar cable management or ram in the wrong slots, but this was by far the worst... Not really your generic tech support story, but I hope y'all get a kick out of it, I'm sure a lot of you have had similar interactions.",126,0,1
GOOD NEWS! You can cancel your vacation!!,"Background: I'm a software developer/consultant and at the time I was working on a long term project.  This happened years ago.  

In February I got approval to take vacation time in September and I immediately started booking/paying for everything (more details below).  Our scheduled go-live was first week of August, which I had taken into account, so my plan had me going on vacation one month after that.  Unfortunately, after numerous delays go-live gets moved to the first week of my vacation. About 5 days before I depart (at this point I'm literally counting down the hours to our departure) the project manager comes up to me and totally out of nowhere this happens:

PM: good news, I just got approval for you to move your vacation, you can now be here for go-live!

Me: Wait, WHAT?  Sorry, thats neither possible nor good news. 

PM: No, its fine, we'll fully reimburse you for everything that you cannot get a full refund on and we'll even allow you to roll those vacation days over if you need to, which you probably will.  

Me: OK, so off the top of my head you'll be covering two plane tickets to &lt;European city A&gt;, Airbnb in &lt;European city B&gt;, AirBnB in &lt;European city C&gt;, accommodation at a winery in &lt;European city D&gt;, train tickets to &lt;different country&gt;, a boutique hotel in &lt;European city E&gt;, AirBnB in &lt;European city F&gt;, and two return flights back from &lt;European city G&gt;.  I can, however, still cancel both of my rental cars and get a full refund.  

PM: &lt;mouth open&gt; You've planned and paid for all of that?

Me: Yes, six months ago immediately after I requested this time off.  This trip required a lot of planning and coordination and the places we're going are high demand/low availability so most require advance payment.  On top of that the time of year is important, so even if I could get refunds, we can't just shift things a few weeks, we'd have to wait an entire year. 

PM: Oh, I thought you and your wife might just be going on a cruise and you could reschedule it...

Me: HAHA! No, cruises aren't my style.  Whenever I go on vacation I always tell everyone that I will be completely unreachable, I thought you understood that was a statement of fact and not just me being difficult.  Is there anything else or should I keep closing out defects before I go on vacation?

PM: yeah, do that.

What blows my mind is how he thought cancelling my vacation just a few days before departure was ""good news"". Did he think I was gonna respond with ""BADASS, I can keep rolling in here to deal with your bullshit instead of going on a magical vacation I spent a month planning and have been dreaming about all day long for the past few months. GREAT NEWS!"".  I know I probably could have gotten refunds on some of that stuff, but fuck that.  I would have turned in my two weeks before skipping out  on that trip.",2611,1,1
Mr X Needs Speakers,"So a bit of background: I'm a Senior Network Engineer and acting Network Manager at a sizeable secondary school in the UK. I've worked here for 6 years and did my apprenticeship training here as well.

This tale is from back when I was an apprentice. To this day this story still sticks in my mind.

I was in the technical office one day when a kid appears at the door. Our office is through the media classroom and for that reason we have a rule (and numerous signs) that during lesson times students aren't allowed to come to the office, unless the classroom door is open, since it would disturb the class in progress. There are exceptions if its an emergency or if their teacher has emailed or called ahead of time, but in this instance we weren't expecting anyone.

Because we didn't want them lingering in the ongoing lesson, I open the door and get them to come into the office.

""Mr ____ needs speakers.""

""Huh?""

""Mr ____ needs speakers.""

I look around the office and ask the Senior Engineer at the time if we got an email from said teacher requesting speakers. This teacher teaches both psychology and PE so if he's taking a PE class it's not unusual that he'd book some portable speakers to use either in the sports hall or the field.

But we didn't get an email. So I ask the kid where his class is. He tells me it's a room inside the school.

""But that room has speakers built into the room. Is this a psychology class?""

""Yeah. The speakers aren't working.""

Okay. We didn't get an email about this either.

At this point the other Engineer chimes in and says that we can't just give out speakers without knowing the problem and that we might be able to fix it, whatever the problem is.

Since I was the apprentice I was sent up to the room to see what the problem was, because the others didn't particularly want to go. So I follow the kid up to the classroom.

Some information about our classrooms: Since I've taken over as Senior Engineer I've implemented a mixture of flatscreen TVs and Prowise screens around the school, but back then we were deep in the realm of projectors. All of the projectors had wall mounted speakers either side of them, and everything was wired into an input panel beside it. All teachers needed to do was plug their laptops into the VGA and AUX cables that ran into the panel. Each panel had 2 visual and 2 audio sockets for different input channels.

So I arrived at the room and the teacher was sat next to the panel. A YouTube video is being projected onto the board but sound is coming out of his laptop.

""Oh! Sir! Thank you [student's name]. Do you have any spare speakers, sir?""

I explain to him that it might not be the speakers that are the problem. It could be the AUX cable, or his laptop's AUX port, or the port in the wall panel. So I go over to have a look...

And I immediately see the problem.

The AUX cable is coming out of channel one...

And going BACK INTO CHANNEL 2.

There is NOTHING plugged into his laptop.

Just to clarify: This man had - instead of plugging the cable into his laptop - plugged the cable into both identical ports beside each other.

Without a word, I take the cable out of channel 2 and plug it into his laptop, and instantly sound starts coming out of the speakers.

The teacher turns bright red and all of the kids in the class start ribbing him.

He's not even particularly technophobic, and he's only 2 years older than me, so there's not the excuse of age being a factor. The only explanation I can think of is that he got a bit confused and panicked.

The teacher is a good mate now and we occasionally have a laugh about it all, but I'm still stunned he didn't realise that was the problem. And that his first instinct was to ask for a whole new set of speakers.",145,0,1
Watching in horror over Zoom as someone nearly deletes a production database,"TL;DR A client in administration try every way possible to fuck up their production database, ending with me having to watch their tech guy, via screen share, as he almost deletes the last copy.

I work for a software development agency. One of our biggest clients, an FX payments company, went into administration. It was a huge clusterfuck - the company was holding money for hundreds of clients, and the administrators needed to wade through all the app's transaction data to work out who they owe money to - sometimes thousands per user. All this data was stored in an AWS Aurora database cluster, which had automated daily backups, multi-az deployments and read-replicas. Idiot proof.

What I failed to realise was the administrator's sheer determination to fuck up.

We offered to help them sort out the AWS account - the server bill was HUGE and most of it was unnecessary now the company wasn't trading. We could do a few hours work, and save them thousands in hosting. We got no response. About a week later, we get automatically forwarded a bunch of ""past due"" warnings from AWS. We send them to the administrator. Nothing.

AWS suspends the account. No more database. The administrators panic, find the money from somewhere and their tech guy reinstates the database. All the data is wrong. They call us in a panic, and we look at it. Turns out their tech guy found the database snapshots and created a new database from them. Only, instead of taking the latest of the daily automated backups, he decided to pick a 5 year old manual snapshot instead. We fix it. Everyone makes mistakes, right?

Fast forward to today - 2 months later. We get another panicked call - they can't see any data in the database. I jump on a video call, and their tech guy shares his screen. I'm looking at a local database schema in MySQL workbench. It has no tables in it. Their tech guy had exported the AWS database to his local machine. He then deleted the AWS database cluster. His local database was the only remaining copy of the production schema, and it was empty.

Fighting the rising sense of dread, my last hope was that he'd exported the database successfully, and he'd just screwed up importing it into MySQL. Still on screen share, I asked him to open the original database dump. Hopefully we could try importing it again. My home connection is crappy - I could see his screen, but at this moment the audio cut out completely.

This is important, because nobody could hear me scream as their tech guy hit the ""Save as"" icon instead of the ""Open"" icon. I watched, helpless, as he navigated to the only intact copy of the production database, which he was about to overwrite with whatever junk was in his editor. It was only at the final moment, as his mouse hovered over the ""Save"" button, that he heard my stream of 4 letter words and stopped what he was doing. The data was intact, but he still has the only copy, just waiting to be fucked up once more.

Today is a whiskey day.

Revert Back to my original OS. I can't work in this environment,"This is from a few years ago when I was working for a contracting company. My first project was helping a company upgrade their entire very outdated environment, that was fairly large. 

This project took about 2 years. Partially because they kept on changing the scope, sometimes we got notified about another group of servers that they magically forgot about. Honestly a very unorganized company. We had to make our own servers so we could scan the environment.

They also were a physical shop, so we had the fun job of bringing in even more contractors to bring in VMware. Idk how much we charged them....but it probably wasn't enough.

I was really really really fresh to IT and the company I landed with, I only had to setup servers on VMware, but I learned so much from the project after working with so many people so that made the 2 years of torture very rewarding for me....the torture went to the other guys....I still feel bad for 'em

So 2 years are over and we managed to get their entire environment over. About 2 months later we get a call. Things in their environment were beginning to fail. So we get in touch with the main administrator at the company so we could help them resolve the issues.

I can't believe what I'm about to say....but this freaking idiot apparently started deleting VMs from the environment we made and went back into putting his physical NT servers back into production. We obviously said you can't be doing this...

This guy on the call basically said that he didn't understand 2012. He couldn't administer it anymore. He will be moving back to NT and we are to help him.

At this point we just got off the call asap and we reached out to the people that hired us and kind of had to tell them what happened. That main administrator was let go. And this part I still feel bad about they basically let go of the entire team that was administering their environment. A different part of my company continued in the future to do all of the support and they didn't get a new infrastructure team. (The only guy that survived the purge was the desktop helpdesk guy)

As one of my very first projects....it a doozy xD.",281,0,1
"Teacher changes classroom, weekend before day 1... and then complains!","So this happened about 4 years ago.

I worked for a K-12 Highschool (not may current one) as the Network Manager, so it wasn't actually my job to deal with classroom issues. But I decided to help out since it was the normal start of year crazy time.

Sitting at my desk I am looking through the Helpdesk's holiday logs, and saw Yes... last week a full audit was done and all rooms reported working.

Phone rings.

Me: Hello IT, how can I help you!

Teacher: I need help, nothing in my room is working and its the first day of term. I wish IT did their job better. I need my project day one of term or I can't teach.

Me: Sorry to hear that, I will be right there.

Since everyone else is busy I jump up and head over there. Now at this point all rooms were the same, large whiteboard on 1 wall that became the front... with controls to one side depending on how the rooms are designed (can't always be the same side). And since Helpdesk and reported full audit done I was getting ready to get cranky that 1 room had been missed.

Arriving at the room, its 8:15am, Roll Call starts at 8:25am.

I walk in the room and instantly no the issue.... I should have guessed with this teacher.

Me: Hi, so what is the issue.

Teacher: My notebook can't project.

I notice she has no cables plugged in.

Me: Have you brought your notebook over to the control area and plugged in the HDMI cable?

Teacher: I don't want to do that, my desk is over here now... far side of the room.

Me: Okay... Can we bring your notebook over to check the connection first.

She agrees but isn't happy... the moment everything is plugged in it works fine... I just look at her.

Me: OKay... so its working.

Teacher: But I want to plug it in over there.

Me: That won't work. This room is setup over here, and was tested on Friday to ensure it would be right for first day of Term. I will bring it up with Helpdesk that they didn't flag the desk had been moved-

Teacher: I moved the desk on the weekend, you see unlike IT I worked this weekend to ensure the first day of term would have no issues.

Me: Did you check the projector worked from that location?

Teacher (getting angry): No... but it should just work. Go and get me a HDMI extension cable.

Me: I can't do that... we would need to get some duct tape or similar to secure the cable to the ground, and maintenance would be cranky at me if I did that... and it may not even work. (10 + isn't good for HDMI, and there was already in-wall runs to go from Projector to control area.

Teacher: Or fine, I'll do it from here.

I smile, telling her we can work together to organise something that's good for everyone but IT needs a heads up. I think everything is done and go about my day. 2 days later I get a meeting invite from a Deputy to discuss an issue.

Turning up at the meeting I see it is with Deputy and the Teacher.

Me: Hey

Deputy: Morning... where here to discuss an issue in Classroom X where Teacher feels you didn't set the room up, she had to spend her own money and apparently IT is blocking it from working.

Me... confused look.

Deputy: Why is IT not helping her out.

Me... confused look: I attended Classroom X on Monday morning when Teacher called, despite the business of the day I attended in less than 5 minutes. The issue is that Teacher had moved her desk to another area of the room, and not where the school mandates desks should be.

Teacher: But you said a longer cable would work... and since you wouldn't get it I purchased a 10 metre HDMI cable from 'retail store X' at a high cost, and you won't make it work.

Me: Is there a Helpdesk ticket about it not working?

Teacher: No... you just aren't letting it work.

Me: I'm sorry, firstly because you brought from 'retail store x' that has sold you a over priced piece of cable. Though as I ddid say it may not even work. See While you have used a 10 metre cable, that is to the wall port, we have about 7 metres of cable in the room to get from the projector to a workable space. And HDMI has issues over 10 metres we have found.

Deputy: Could you have not told her that on Monday?

Me: I told her a longer cable may not work... it isn't an exact science. It comes down to the type of cable, the projector and the computer. I also advised Teacher that I would be more than happy to organise a solution with her if she wanted and was not asked any further questions. 

Deputy: So why did this only become an issue on the Monday morning.

Teacher: Because they didn't setup my room correctly.

Me: That's not right. Helpdesk did a full audit of all rooms just before the term started, we do this in the last 2 days of the holidays on Thursday and Friday to ensure all is fine for Monday. Though Teacher told me they attended school on the Saturday and Sunday and moved everything around. Including making a demaning remark about working on the weekend to ensure a smooth start of term. Regardless out of the 130 rooms we manage this was the only room that did not work day 1 of term, and did not work due to it being re-arranged after we checked the room.

Deputy: So can we get the room re-arranged to fit Teachers need.

Me: We can...

Deputy: Great!

Me: Though I won't.

Teacher: You see... they won't help.

Deputy: Why not?

Me: Because of the cost. To re-cable this room will require me basically re-doing the room, take a day and cost over a $1,000 just to change the cable location. And will create a dangerous situation where teachers can customiser every room and IT will require to support whatever they want. We have a hard rule here that IT cables the most efficiently for the space.

Deputy: Surely in this case.

Me: I would require it in writing from yourself, CC'ing the Business Manager (like CFO) that I am being asked to change a room to fit the teacher. And it would have to state that it is a one off allowance so that we don't get this request next time Teacher moves rooms.

Deputy: Why next time? And why the request with the Business Manager.

Me: Well because my budget doesn't really have spare for 'keeping teachers happy'. And Teacher has only just moved into this room while other rooms are renovated. Within a few months she could move ago. Also, as I am sure you remember, we are moving to getting rid of teacher desks (executive discussion) so in my opinion it is a waste of money.

Deputy: Okay, thank you I'll talk with Teacher. Don't action anything.

TL;DR: Teacher complains because she moved her desk. Ended up getting into a meeting with Deputy and Teacher where I had to remind Deputy that we don't do custom rooms for teachers and that we planned to get rid of teacher desks.",1245,0,1
Stuck between customer and end customer,"Tldr on background info, we're a distributor of security materials (CCTV, access, etc etc) which includes the whole IT-shtick that comes with it (servers, cabling, switches/routers, etc).

This happened about 2 years ago, but it popped back into my head and I figured I'd share it. A client of mine calls me and asks me to recommend some camera's and a recorder to him for a restaurant.  I do so, he's happy with what we have agreed on and places the order.

About 2 weeks later I get a call from said customer who explains to me that one of the camera's doesn't record well and that it frequently goes offline. The camera in question was meant to keep an eye on kitchen staff.  We agree on a time to do teamviewer the next morning.

I log onto teamviewer, check the camera, seems fine, but he's right, I see chunks missing from the recording. I ask him if he checked the cabling. He said he did. We did firmware upgrades, resets, reconfigurations, etc, only to have him call me back 2 days later telling me it's not fixed.  I log on again the next morning and I see that there were indeed chunks missing from the recording. Logs also indicate there were disconnections. Told him it could be a network issue, but he assured me there was one measly 8 port GB unmanaged switch and that there were only 3 camera's connected to it. Told him I could check with the manufacturer to make sure everything was OK. 

At this point he's getting annoyed and is arguing that he wants the camera replaced and wants us to pay for all the extra hours spent there working while it was supposed to be an easily installation.  He'd call me multiple times a day, demanding solutions, compensation, etc and he'd send me emails upon emails asking for updates. All this over a course of 2-3 days.

I talked to my boss telling him I'm pretty sure there's a network/cabling issue somewhere because I can't find anything wrong with the device and he gives me the OK to go on site to check it out. I arrive on site a few days later in the early morning before the restaurant opens, go to the kitchen  and within 10 min I find the issue (wasn't visible from the camera feed).

Me = Tea - Customer = Bob - End-customer = Jake

&gt;**Tea**: Yeah, there's your problem.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bob**: Where?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Tea**: There. The cable for this camera is placed against the wall, behind the microwaves.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Jake**: ...and?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Tea**: Let me check the recordings again, but I feel like you only have connection issues when the restaurant is open for service.

I check the recordings and yep, during the mornings and late evenings, the recordings were 100% fine.

&gt;Jake: So you are telling me, that because this cable was put behind these 3 microwaves, there's an issue with the images?!  
&gt;  
&gt;Tea: Yes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Jake: How can a microwave fuck up the image of a camera?!  
&gt;  
&gt;Tea: Uh... I can show you.

So I surf to the camera and we stare at ourselves huddled around my laptop. I ask Jake to turn on all 3 of the microwaves and within a minute you can see the camera experiencing freezes and choppy imagery.

&gt;**Bob**: I...Uh...So it wasn't the camera that was the issue but the cable?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Tea:** Well more specifically *where* you placed the cable. A SFTP cable should fix this issue but they're more expensive than a simple UTP CAT5e  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bob**: Right. Right I can do that.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Jake**: I hope you'll be doing this for free then?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bob**: What? No it was you who wanted to have the installation done in half a day. I wanted to put the cable in the ceiling.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Jake**: Yeah but I expected you to do at least a good job! You could've used that ...special cable too!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Tea**: SFTP.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Jake**: Yeah, that!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bob**: Oh it wouldn't have made that big of a difference anyway! Right, Tea?!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Tea**: I... uhm... Well...

Afterwards they kept arguing about it and both of them were trying to get me to agree with them. It was a pretty damn stressful situation, now that I think about it? Technically it was Bob's fault for placing the cable there seeing Jake had little to no understanding of any of these things. 

Called my boss who told me to just politely wish them a nice day and leave.  I tested the camera with a shorter cable (away from the microwaves) and it worked without any issues to prove my point, had them sign the papers that I was there and then just left. 

Felt pretty good about it because he blamed the entire thing on us, while it was him who fucked up. ",147,0,1
I needed the Internet...,"Not my Story, but my Husbands, who is a trained System Adminstrator and works with many clients through his firm. 

This time, a Client called to tell him, that a steel press had stopped working. The Interface was shot and nothing worked as it should. So, my hubby drives there, and this is what happened 
(Everything is of course just an approximation of what was said, as I wasn't there)

H: Hubby                                                              S:Supervisor                                                               Id:Idiot working there, though probably not much longer.

H gets there and immediately realizes that the connection to the Internet is non-existent. He looks at all the cables at the press and everything is plugged in.
He and S try and fail to reboot, rework fix anything. During all this time, Id sits in a Corner at his Laptop and every once in a while throws in some remark in the vein of: ""Yeah that totally stopped working"" and ""that prgramm isn't doing anything anymore!"" So, after about an Hour, my Hubby is *this* close to giving up when he looked over to the guy at the laptop.  More specifically, the LAN-cable, coming from his Laptop and going into the *the only Box in the room*.
And next to it, you guessed it, lay the LAN-cable that was supposed to connect the Steel press to the Internet. 

H:... did you pull that cable out?                          Id:Yeah, I needed Internet                                                H: There is Wlan in this building... and also *that* is cable connecting the Press to the Internet 

According to my Hubby, you could have heard a Pin drop in the silence that followed. The Supervisor thanked H and send him home. And in the car he called his co-worker and they laughed harder then ever at this complete moron who managed to pull that cable out *while his boss was looking*

The printer can also make copies?!?,"I do tec support in the military.  It is honestly very fun and I have some wild stories. This happed a few years ago while I was posted overseas. At the time I worked for a nice but not very technologically savvy officer.  He was smart in so many other ways that it was bizarre how bad he was with computers. 
About a month before this happened I had installed a large multifunction printer to the building he worked in.  I know he had seen it because it was a network printer and I had mapped it for him. I had even seen him grab things off it, so I know he had seen the printer. 
One morning I get a message from the officer:

Officer: Can I make a color copy? 

Me: Secret or Not Secret? (This is important because you can’t do one on a machine that is designated for the other)

O:Not Secret

Me:Sir, you can use the printer in your building.

O: It can do that?!?

Me: Yes, sir.
 
I keep a screen shot of the conversation for when I need a laugh.",176,0,1
Five Year Intern Small Tales,"Wow, can't believe I just found this subreddit...here are some of my favorite encounters with the less technologically inept.

I guess a little background...I started interning at my place of work one summer and they just never let me leave. I do application support and am a very by-the-SOP type of person. If an SOP says you need to provide all information on the form correctly, it better be. I'm a pain. I don't want to deal with the FDA during audits. CYOA.


1. As any company does, we have access forms that require the requesting user's loginID and all that other fun information they so kindly forget to provide. I sent the user an email since they forgot to provide it on the form (if I had a dollar for every time I've had to do that, I wouldn't have to work at this job anymore.) The lady emails me back and says, ""I don't have a loginID, I'm a contractor."" That is very sweet of you ma'am, but how did you login to your computer to write me this email...It was later provided. Kind Regards.
2. We upgraded one of our systems and we didn't have the authentication source connected to our AD. We still don't to this day, four years later. My director loves me, so he put me on hypercare support and my email/phone number were everywhere for everyone to contact me at. Everything was okay until one lady calls me and tells me she is unable to login to the system/needs a password reset. Cool. No problem. Please provide your name and we will assist you right away. Sooooo, I've reset this woman's password about five times now . She is telling me, as she is arguing with someone in the background and smoking a cigarette at the same time that she still can't access the **system**. Then she finally says **IT**, ""I'm not able to log onto my computer."" (takes deep breathe) Please contact the Heldesk so that they can assist you. Have a nice day.
3. For the most part, I really do love working with our Reg Affairs team. They are wonderful people and are able to handle themselves. Buttttttt, they have their issues. Before the year was out, our ruthless leaders in some European country decided that it was time for everyone to upgrade their Citrix client. Since I love our RA team so much, I let the director of the team know that I can set-up a meeting with everyone to do the upgrade together (**Side note:** every single user was sent specific instructions on what to do. With pictures and everything). I love that team, so I hand hold them as much possible. I'm waiting for some to graduate high school still. Anyways....Meeting is set-up and the users gather around me like a camp counselor as we go over the step-by-step instructions sent to their emails a month ago. We get to entering in the one-time login information for Citrix and I guess we start having problems. They start telling me they can't login. I go over and see what they're all typing. I shit you not. Everyone is putting in domain\\(theirusername) instead of companydomain\\blah blah. They saw the example in the field that said domain\\loginID and thought that's what they all must put in. I laughed a little inside and we got past this hurdle. Upgrade complete. No casualties.
4. As I posted up above, I work in application support and not Citrix support as the RA team likes to think I do. This somehow in our entire huge company means that I receive five emails/tickets a week to help someone set up/fix their printer connection. Sorry QA, please contact the Helpdesk. I am paid only a dollar more than them to listen to you complain once a week, not twice.
5. One of my favorites. In one of our larger systems we have notifications being sent out daily to remind users to complete their trainings. One manager forwards an email to me from their employees saying, ""I keep receiving all of these notifications for training. How do I stop receiving these emails?"" **Dead serious.** The manager asks me to respond. I reply, ""The notifications will stop being sent once you have completed your trainings in the system."" Kind Regards. My work here is done. They shall succeed today.
6. This one isn't a ticket that was sent to me. It's one that me being the sysadmin of....I couldn't help but scroll past it in the ticket feed. In our facilities ticketing system one fruitful morning...it was blessed with this gem.

Recommendation for protection from solar flares,"Been lurking on this subreddit for some time without posting, even though I worked in Enterprise support for more than 20 years.  No way you can work in support that long without having some stories.  So here goes my first post.  I started my career in the mid-1990s working in the call center for a computer company who sold very high-end computers to banks and other customers who needed up time guarantees and the ability to swap out failing hardware without outages.  The support teams were generally quite good and customers paid a lot of money for this.  But we also used to get some weird questions/issues.  Customers of this company did very little self-troubleshooting.  Any issues, and they called us.  

One of my favorite tickets was one I saw while reviewing open tickets handled by our second level team in Australia.  Our support followed the sun, so part of our job was to review if any tickets were ""warm"" that came in overnight before our shift.  I found a ticket where a customer in the UK had read a news story explaining that scientists expected a much higher level of solar flare activity coming up in the next few months.  It also said that solar flares can actually impact computer hardware in unexpected ways.  The customer opened the ticket as a sev 1 asking if the  were any preventative measures they could take against the solar flares, referring to the article.  One of our level 2 engineers from Australia took the call and put a brief note saying they told the customer to cover the entire server with SPF factor 35 and aluminum foil.  The customer agreed to close the call (and the ticket was closed).  

I immediately printed up the support ticket and saved it.  Found it a couple of years ago when I moved offices at work.  Still made me laugh.",237,0,1
Always User Error,"In 2002, I worked for a startup internet security company.  We were hired by a trendy marketing company who had a massive open plan trendy office.  They had issues with people from other companies in the same building walking in to chat and seeing confidential data.  Some people forgot to lock their workstation even when they went home at the end of the day, and they wanted an automated system.

The building this company were in, had a single reception for six separate businesses over two floors.  There were three marketting organisations, 2 web design companies and the headquarters of a local small brewery.  

The way that the building was laid out meant that there was no easy way to have a receptionist at the front of each area, no easy way to add magnetic RFID locks to each area, and the only security they had was that each area had lockable doors, but they had to be kept open when there were people in the office.  They also required an RFID card to acutally get past reception withough having to sign in.

Our solution was to sell them a device that reads a RFID tag on their ID card once every three seconds.  If the tag cannot be read twice in succession, it triggers a windows workstation lock.  The range was around 1 metre.

Unfortunately...

Within a month, we started to get complaints that the system wasn't working.  We tested a few things in the office, then I attended site to see what was going on.  I didn't see a single failure, and even quizzed a few people who said that the system was great it was ok.

I reported back to my boss, and we made a note in the file.

Another two weeks pass by and more complaints about unlocked screens.  The director of the marketing company was now yelling as they paid a lot of money ... etc. Standard practice.

We researched the issue, we contacted the suppliers, we looked at case studies and contacted other companies who used it.  No-one had any issues other than our client.  We then went to site again - six of us.

At the end of about 2 hours, we suddenly realised what was going wrong.

Once in the office, the employees didn't want a coloured lanyard with a large badge on it rattling against their desk or digging into their chest.  Some slipped the badge into a shirt pocket, while others simply removed the badge and placed it on their desk.

As these people went to use the kitchen, the toilet, other places in the same building, they didn't bother to take their ID with them.  This led to several workstations remaining unlocked.

We told the director of the company what we found, and told him that short of embedding a chip in someone's hand, we cannot make anything more automatic than we have.",750,0,1
127.0.0.1,"Not sure if this qualifies to be here, I don't do support as being on call. I am a Network Admin in a data center. I can't go into specifics, but in essence I ban bad guys, configure routers, give out subnets to our departments etc.

But the other day, I was working our router alarms and one feature is, that we check if the source IP is the one we expect on that interface. And one router was showing a really high error rate regarding this filter. So I logged into our logging server and the router, did my commands, dumped the traffic and even with the fast scrolling tcpdump, I immediately noticed this beauty:

src: 127.0.0.1    
dst: 127.0.0.1

I blocked the server, notified the customer. In the end, it was a misconfigured database according to the customer, that sent this into our AS. My bet is rather that they gave `lo0` a different IP, deleted `127.0.0.1` and the localhost IP got routed to `0.0.0.0/0`, but they didn't tell me more. They did fix it though.

Anyway, it got a chuckle out of me and also showed once more, that a NIC does not care about what you send out. Not in the slightest.",611,0,1
"Troubleshooting ipod with customer, she is looking at the back of the ipod the whole time","Happened to a colleague, our users use an ipod installed into a case with a trigger handle for a mobile picking app. Posted this in a comments of a similar thread but I'd like it's own post.

EU = end user, su= support

When we receive a call we always try to mitigate sending a tech to site by troubleshooting with the EU. But let's fast forward 10 min into the support call...

EU: all I see is the apple logo, I keep hitting the power button to force reset but only the apple logo is showing

Su: no problem, and we are sure its fully charged? 

Eu: yes I can see the light when I left it charging in the docking cradle. 

Su: ok I'd like to send a tech to wipe and re-install the OS
But before we do that I just want to make sure when you press the power button on the case u can hear it click

Eu: listen I'm not stupid, I go to university 

Su: no mam it's not like that, i just need to be sure

Eu: yes i can hear the click but i only see the apple logo

Su: *gets an epiphany* um by any chance at the bottom of the screen do you see something?

Eu: it says assembled in California...... oh..... let me see something *removes ipod from case* ... ok I know the issue

Su: was the ipod backwards?

Eu: it was backwards 

*continues the call to ensure app is working* 

Why the end user didn't realize earlier? - she felt the need to justify
The volume button lined up with the cases power button and the fast charge dock works no matter which way the phone is facing.

I refuse to troubleshoot. Just fix it.,"Let me tell you the full story of my experiences with a particular user. Before her first day, I imaged her laptop myself, using her dock that she was going to utilize from home. (I knew personally that all her equipment worked.)

Call one-

The day after I imaged her laptop, my wife was getting surgery when the user started blowing up my phone. 

I’m in the waiting room with nothing to do except worry so I answer. 

Her: “The docking station you gave me is broken, I’m an AV professional, I know how to set it up, I set it up at home so you gave me a broken one” 

Me: “Ok, can we FaceTime to see how you’ve got it wired?” -we FaceTime- “oh I see it’s not plugged into power, lets get that going-“ (she hangs up on me as the docking station starts working)

(Months pass)

Call two-

My phone blows up as the same person sends multiple separate high priority tickets with the same issue- her email isn’t as fast on her laptop as it is on her phone. 

I remote in, and call. I see that she is connected to a hotspot in her own house that has Wi-Fi, and she is connected to vpn. 
(Side note, I always take my calls on wireless headphones, so I can hear very clearly what the other person says.)

Me: “just for troubleshooting purposes, I’ll need you to turn your hotspot off and we will need to connect to your home Wi-Fi”

Her: “this setup worked yesterday”

Me: “yes but it doesn’t work today, so I need to figure out why. Can you turn the hotspot off for a minute?”

Her: (in a tiny, tiiiiiiny whispered voice) “I don’t like you”

Me: (incredulous laughter) “okay! Well we can get someone else to help you if you’d rather?” (More laughter)

Her: (obviously surprised I heard her) “I just need this fixed. Do I need to be on the phone?”

Me: “no I think I can take it from here, I just needed your hotspot turned off, you have a nice day”

Her: (hangs up)


Me: (huge laugher, as the issue was fixed)",854,0,1
I'm stupid for not knowing anything about a network I don't support (long-ish),"Background: I work Tier 1 help desk, but our organization services about 10 different networks, and we are responsible for anything from hardware to account creation to PKI to managing exchange servers. Because of the variety of things we support, we have a centralized database of ""how to"" articles for just about any incident we've ever run into. A classic Jack of all trades, master of none situation. 

It's the beginning of my shift and I've just logged into everything that I need for the day, so I am ready to start taking calls. I go into a ready status on our call manager and my phone rings immediately.

 Me: ""Thank you for calling X, my name is OP, can I have your (main system) ID please?"" 

Customer: (Scoffs) ""I don't know what that is.""

Me: ""It should be your username for logging on to (system).""

Customer: ""I JUST SAID I don't know what that is, why do you even need it?""

Me: ""Well I need the ID to locate you in our ticketing system so I can open your ticket.""

Customer: ""Can you not look me up by name? Or did they not teach you how to do that?""

A user ID is our preferred method, because it is a unique ID. Of our hundreds of thousands of customers, searching by name is a little bit more cumbersome, so it is not the first move.

Me, preparing myself for what this is about to be: ""Can I get your first and last name?""

Customer provides her name, I look her up that way in our ticketing system. Lo and behold, she does have a user ID. I open a ticket in her name and proceed.

Me: ""Alright ma'am, what can I do for you today?""

Customer: ""I need access to (another user's) email box on (acronym I've never heard of before, XYZ).""

I am immediately puzzled by her request to access someone else's email, but I put that on the back burner for now.

Me: ""I'm sorry ma'am, would you mind saying the whole name? I am not familiar with that acronym.""

Customer, picking up attitude: ""Really? You've never heard of XYZ? Your own system? Wow, brilliant.""

Me: ""Ma'am, let me put you on a brief hold and I'll see if any of my coworkers have heard of this before.""

Caveat- I'm still newish to this organization and since we have so many responsibilities, it is entirely possible that this is our system and I just haven't heard about it. I search it in our ""how to"" articles, no results. I ask my desk neighbors, no clue. I throw it into our Tier 1 chatroom, no clue. 

Me: ""Ma'am, none of my coworkers have heard of this system before, so unless you know what the acronym stands for I'm not sure how else I can look it up. I don't think this is our system.""

Customer, almost yelling: ""Are you stupid? You don't know your own systems? It's very, very simple, X   
 Y  Z  okay, that's what I need. THIS IS URGENT. How about instead of asking your little coworkers, we use some common sense here and have a scrap of intelligence and you go ask a supervisor? Can we do that?""

At this point I am fuming. I'm no genius, but I'm certainly not stupid. I also don't think it's very hard to maintain a polite and professional attitude in just about any situation, meaning her demeanor is an out-right choice. I'm ready to get this butthole off the phone. I say ""Of course ma'am, one moment."" I put myself on mute, stand up from my desk, and start going off to my desk neighbors. I ask one of them, who is a trainer (our supervisors are not always at our physical location) to speak to her because I'm done. He gets on the phone with the best customer service voice someone could possibly muster and starts asking her what the issue is. At this point several of my coworkers have come over to my desk to ask for the tea, and I'm pissed so I'm spilling it, so I'm not paying attention to what the trainer is saying. After a few minutes he taps me on the shoulder.

Trainer: ""OP, I was able to dig around a little bit and the system she is asking about belongs to (another organization). I told her this, and said I would put you back on the phone to finish up the ticket."" 

My face lights up with joy. I feel vindicated after getting confirmation that this is in fact NOT something I should have known about, so I can't help but to get back on the call with a slight ""hmm interesting"" kind of tone. 

Me: ""Ma'am, my supervisor has informed me that XYZ is not a system we support, is that correct?""

Customer, wiping egg off her face, probably: ""Yeah, my bad... I thought it was.""

Nope, I don't like that fake ass half apology. 

Me: ""Okay, let me grab your information and I will route your ticket to the appropriate group.""

I did not route her ticket to the appropriate group. Small victories.",613,0,1
"Where Internet comes from, and why Wi-Fi is evil","Hello TFT, I recently, finally, finished my apprenticeship. To celebrate, let me share probably the weirdest thing that happened to me while trying to become a Techie.

Years ago, I was working for a school. Multiple buildings, a couple hundred students, few dozen teachers. besides me there were  always 2 other apprentices. For the most part, we were tasked with manning the phones and dealing with only ""basic"" stuff. To the point that officially, you were not allowed to plug or unplug anything unless one of the Bosses gave you the go ahead first. Which was fine for the most part, since I'm reasonably certain I solved 80% of my cases with a simple reboot.

One of my bigger projects was installing Wi-Fi, and ensuring that the entire main building had coverage. At first, everything was dandy, as people were enjoying finally being able to connect wirelessly. But after a few months, we started getting complaints.

""I want that thing gone."" That ""thing"" being Access Points. It was an old building, and most rooms were used for classes or offices for teachers. There was a limit where we could put them, since it had been decided putting them in the halls would make it more likely for students to vandalize them (Something that happened a lot). One of the Teachers had apparently ""read Online"" that the waves sent out by APs waere harmful. I remember that I had to try really hard not to laugh at the guy, because he called it ""Internet Energy"" at one point.

Not too bad, meant literally his office and his classroom didn't have any coverage. But then more complaints kept coming in, as more people were kindly informed about the harmful influence. It got progressively stupider too. Initially they said that APs would cause headaches, and eventually it escalated to them apparently causing cancer (No, really. I had people yell at me for that.).

Apprentices were not allowed to talk back in any way. Even if the people we spoke to, or more commonly, the people yelling at us were provably wrong. So every time another complaint came up, I had to call down into our department, get the Boss on the line, confirm that I had to remove the AP, and then do just that. He didn't really want to argue this with any of the teachers either. The fact that we caved immediately and just removed the APs seemed to just reaffirm the people complaining that they were correct.

So little by little, we had to remove around 80% of the previously placed APs. The only two places that had coverage in the end were our Department, and the Directors Office (Quote: ""Even if they do, I ain't afraid of no cancer.""). Which, hilariously, meant that both of these places would be insanely crowded during breaks. I frequently had to muscle my way through two dozen teenagers to get my coffee back to my station.

About 6 months later, one of the older teachers retired and was replaced. When he wondered aloud in the break room why only two places in the building had coverage, I told him the answer. ""That's dumb."" he said. ""I've worked in IT before, who would believe that? Could you put a new AP up on my floor please?"".

And so we did, and in the same week, we started getting requests to put the others back too.",2203,0,1

Why I dug a shallow grave.,"Hey all!

It's your Humble IT Deity back with another tale of shock, awe, and technolust.

This tale comes from a technical staffing  company named after an electrical unit of measurement.

Occasionally the Lords of Coin and Pointless  People Policy would forget to forsake us.  They would do things such as approve purchases and allow us training and food.  They would, rarely, after the appropriate genuflecting and performance of distasteful and demeaning physical acts, give us  headcount.

Now our interview process was both simple and arduous.  We would have our fearless leader phone screen for team fit and then we'd gently beat the ever living hell out of the tributes in the technical interview.  

None of the gentle ""how many coins to the top of the Empire State Building"" but more like describe in as much detail how DHCP works in an enterprise setting while we look deep into their personality flaws.

We had to be ruthless because mistakes for our team and organization were extremely expensive.  

This system weeded out such gems as...

""Tell us about your weaknesses."" - ""I never publicly disclose my weaknesses.""

""How many /28 subnets are in a /24?"" - ""Doesn't matter, just make everything a C-class  IP range.""

""How do handle problem users?"" - ""I don't, that's what lower help desk weenies are for.""

Then I had to be quarantined for Swine Flu.

They interviewed while I was out and when I returned $DA - dumbass - had been hired. 

We tell newbies to get their feet wet by ""LOOKING"" and only looking at documentation and servers.  We then send them to our handful of server rooms around the building so they know where everything is.

What we don't tell them to do is randomly power off production servers to figure out what they do by seeing what breaks.

Guess what $DA did?  Just guess.

Now if you guessed he did that you'd be right but that wasn't enough.  We were in full battle mode at that point and when we went to the server room to figure out why the PUBLIC FACING WEB HOST AND EMAIL SMART HOST WERE DOWN.  

He had stopped in the middle of his massive  saboteur rampage to unroll his prayer rug to face towards Mecca to pray... right there in the middle of the server room.

We powered everything back on and he had the audacity to complain to HR that we interrupted his prayers by bursting into the server room and turning everything on that he had shutdown.

I have more $DA stories such as breaking all of email and going home.  Stealing our entire employee and payroll database to play with and learn SQL.  Breaking two AD forests and the fucking off home.  Ignoring precise instructions and breaking all email.... multiple times.

So yeah.... outside of Seattle dug a shallow grave.",614,0,1
"This PC isn´t used by anybody, so we can unplug it","This isn't story of mine, but my mother's from the time she worked as tech support for an superbig three letter firm.

**Background**

My mum worked in 1990s in this firm as an server tech support. Also, I'm not from the US, but Czech Republic. One day she recieved a call from one of state agencies, that their system is not working at all. So she drove to the town to investigate. The conversation looked something like this:

**The conversation**

$W - office worker

$M: So, what is the problem?

$W: I can turn on the computer, but I can't even login. This happens to all of us on all of the computers.

*$M confirms that it is true and goes to see the server*

*When she walks in, she can see dark server, with cloth and coffe pot on it. Not to mention table and chairs in the super small room.*

$M: why did you unplug the server?

$W: Oh, we thought, that it's not needed since nobody works on this computer. And this is the only air-conditined room in the building, so we made it our rest area.

This happened again few weeks later. This time, mum was able to determine by phone, they replaced server with a fridge.",5223,0,1
I had a customer come in threatening to break our jaws!,"I usually work in the back of the shop getting things done, but this day, the guy running the desk job had a huge guy come in the door, like 7 feet tall and pissed off like all holy hell!

He threatened to break our jaws because we were trying to recover files from his old hard drive, but we didn't have much luck.

I had to come out to the front desk (not my normal job duty) and shake his hand, and explain that when mechanical hard drives fail, its often like scratching a needle on a record and it fucks the tracks up.

I also informed him that we indeed had been running our best recovery software on it, but what few files we could get, was taking forever.

So basically I chilled this 7 foot tall brute out with plain logic, a smile, and a handshake, and to be honest, I was scared shitless!",250,0,1
The printer that never worked.,"This story happened way back in the early 90s, as told to me by a friends dad.

His company made specialzed industrial level printers which were shipped all over Europe.

Usually a technician would accompany the printer and set it up at the faraway locations, unless the client had their own technicians and didn't need the extra service.


One time a French client ordered a printer and would install it themselves. 

It arrives, they install it, it doesn't work.

It gets sent back.

My friends dad tests it. It works fine.

They send it again.

The client sets it up again. It doesnt work.

Back to my friends dad it goes. Tests it again.

It works fine.

He accompanied the printer back on its third trip to see why it wouldn't work at the clients factory.

He watched as they connected every cable to the relative ports of each server while he sat there in silence.

20 minutes later they've finished and they've tried and failed to make it work, so they ask friends dad what's wrong.

*They didn't plug in the power cable.*

T-Rex at a board meeting,"First Post (mobile)

Background: from the US. Been doing help desk support for ~6yrs. I worked as in-house IT for ~2.5yrs, and MSP help desk for ~3.5yrs. Certified engineer for a VoIP phone system. Most of my training was self taught [trial and error, YouTube, etc], and the rest was learned on the job.

Story time:

My first IT job was help desk with an on-call rotation. I was required to answer all on-call requests within 15 minutes, no exceptions. If I didn’t respond within that time frame, I would receive a write-up and disciplinary action.

We had a board meeting with all the department heads, and the CEO of the company (80yr old man), to discuss our newly implemented IT policies and procedures (including the aforementioned on-call requirement). During the meeting, the CEO demanded that our techs had their phones on at all times during their on-call rotation, and the severity of the punishment should we fail to respond in a timely fashion. This being my first real IT job, it took measures to ensure I would always hear my phone ring by setting obnoxiously loud ringtones. The facility I was working in had a lot of large machinery that was particularly loud (I swear, I developed mild tinnitus from working there). My ringtone of choice: the T-Rex roar from Jurassic Park (for those who don’t know this iconic roar, a quick google search should suffice... headphone users beware.) 

As the CEO was reviewing and answering questions about the new policies, I get a tech call... [insert obnoxious roar here.] 

Several department heads spilled coffee and various papers were violently shuffled about in a panic.

CEO: WHAT THE FLYING F*CK WAS THAT?! ARE YOU TRYING TO GIVE ME A HEART ATTACK?!

Me: umm... [checks email]... your wife says her printer is out of paper and she wants me to refill it.

CEO: ...are you f*cking kidding me?

Me: ...no, sir. That’s what the ticket says... should I go now or...?

(The CEO’s wife had a supply closet in her office containing reams of paper, ink/toner, etc, less than three feet from her desk.)

CEO: [takes my cell phone and calls his wife]

One loud and angry conversation later, the on-call policy was revised. We were no longer required to answer the phone during normal business hours.",381,0,1
The broken power button drama.,"Hi TFTS!

My first article so lets see how it goes, as English is not my primary language.

An long time ago during my college period i was doing an internship at an local tiny IT shop in a nearby village. Only one real employee (lets call him Bob)   with 3 interns (including me, Ex1Leee) clearly taking advantage of us and letting us doing the dirty work. We daily needed to replace the eBay advertisements of old junk so the advertisement was on top, getting our accounts banned a couple of times.

One incident i clearly remember, a women brought in here HP computer, the older ones with the HDD dock in the front (the old silver ones, I couldn’t find the exact type). Stylish in that time and the HDD dock was functional, it came with the external HDD included.

The problem was that the power button was broken.  Bob told me to wait a few days and tell her we called HP and couldn’t get an replacement part (without calling HP of course, he wasn’t in for the hazzle) We could replace the case for her with an second hand one we had. The customer accepted the offer and we went on.

Bob wanted me to use the old case that we already threw in the bin, to throw away, an case yellow from smoke and full of dents. (I already thought, the customer will totally flip.) But ok, not my call to make. I went on and moved all the parts to the “new” case. Now i was left with one final problem, the HDD from the front dock, we weren’t able to move the proprietary dock from HP. Bob decided to build in the HDD in the case. (without calling the customer) He peeled of the rubbers where he thought the screws would be but couldn’t find any, moving on to pick up an hammer and flat head screwdriver hammering the cracks on the side, finally opening up the HDD case. He placed the HDD and called the customer without even testing the HDD or even the computer at all…

I was really curious about what was going to happen when she picked up the computer. The pick-up counter was right next to our office only separated with frosted glass. As she picked the computer up and she saw the case she went in a total fury, going super Saiyan. She was so mad the glass vibrated. Things only went worse when Bob proudly announced he placed the external hdd internally.",162,0,1
Just some old recordings...,"First time posting here.

I work for a company that specializes in CRM application, but that wasn't the case from the beginning. 

The company started by developing applications for Windows Phone based devices (the original smartphones and PDAs running Windows), such as custom keyboards (which were customizable - something unheard of in that time), advanced file manager, few games and audio recorder, which is the star of this story. 

This recorder supported your usual formats, like mp3, wav, etc. but also our proprietary recording format which offered goodcompression (which was important in those times as storage was small and expensive for mobile devices) while maintaining good audio quality.

Now, 16 years after the app has been published and quite a few years after the official support was dropped, we received a support request from a guy, asking us if it is possible to convert some recordings from our format to mp3. We explained that there is no converter, but that what he can do is install a Windows Phone emulator and install the application, which we sent him. We also included the steps on how to export the recordings into different format (let me tell you, seeing Windows Phone 6.5 was a trip down the memory lane). 

And we thought nothing of it, just a support request for an application that has been dead for a long time. We weren't sure if he would manage to succeed. But then his reply arrived.

He managed to successfully export the recording to mp3 and they were intact. He also revealed, that they were recording of his son from a very young age and he valued them greatly, as he cherished those moments of easier life.

Let me tell you, there have been many moments when we felt good that we managed to solve a problem for our customer, but this has taken it to another level. Just thinking that there is a guy with a son, that is probably going to college, and we manage to uncover reminders of the past that he presumed were lost warms our hearts. I sure hope that I never forget about this story.",303,0,1

$CL (a bit flustered): BUT I DELETED IT! UGH, fine....I guess. BUT, only if you fix it!   
$FNT = \*Chuckles internally, channeling my Darth Vader impulses\*...Yes I can help you out, don't  
worry about it! 

\*\* 45 minutes pass by with FNT explaining that the folder was likely moved. $CL does not relinquish control of the PC despite my explanation, or still believe this could be possible. I am beyond bewildered at this point, but keep my cool and just stay with her until resolution.\*\*

$FNT = Let FNT have one final look if you do not mind please.   
$CL = Okay, I guess. 

\*\*At this point, I perform a search for the folder name and find it in a folder moved to one of her 100s of subfolders in her outlook. \*\*

$CL = OH MY GOD, I ACTUALLY DID MOVE IT!   
$FNT = Mam', are you using a laptop or a desktop?   
$CL = Laptop, WHY?!?  
$FNT = Well, you may have inadvertently held your palm over the touchpad on the laptop thus dragging the folder without even knowing it.....

"What was that, what did you just do???","First time posting here.

In my junior year at college (3 years ago) I had to complete an unpaid internship for a non-profit as a ""course credit"" in order to complete my major. It was only 10 hours a week and was assigned quasi-randomly. 

I was ecstatic to find out that I was working for a non-profit that needed help in streamlining their google sheets experience. One of the few things I was very comfortable with. 

On my first day I get the lay of the office and this sweet older administrative assistant begins sharing the google drive folders with me. She was a retired teacher who volunteered full time at this organization that mentors students. 

Poking through the spreadsheets I discovered they had 40+ sheets they share with local schools and had tons of student data (none of it was sensitive). Over the course of the semester I helped automatically scrape every single sheet and import it into a master sheet while calculating specific data for each month that this older volunteer had to do manually every week. However, what I remember the most was what I showed her that first day; on accident. 

I opened up the largest spreadsheet they had, which was about 10,000 rows. It was also their most viewed spreadsheet around the small office. This sweet old volunteer is over my shoulder watching me as I bounce around the sheet.

As I scroll threw all this data, I instinctively click **View-&gt;Freeze-&gt;1 Row**, so I know what I am looking at as I scroll down. 

She stops me and says: ""What was that, what did you just do???"" 

**$Me**: ""I just froze the top row.""

**$Her**: ""I need you to show me how you did that.""

She then gestured me to follow her into her office and she booted up her Chromebook. In that moment I saw the most clever and adorable solution to this age old problem.

This 65yr old women had **taped a thin strip of notebook paper with each column header written out in pencil along the top bezel of her laptop.** 

She mentioned how often she used that spreadsheet and she was always getting lost when she scrolled through it.

She looked at me and said: ""Well don't I look silly"" and proceeded to tear that thin strip of notebook paper off of her laptop. I just smiled while I watched her open up every other google sheet she used to freeze the top row.",2781,1,1

But, after our security head spoke with him, it became clear that Bob simply didn't understand the point of 2FA: he had received the phone call when he wasn't trying to log in...*and he confirmed it anyway.*

"""You need to find out who had it open.""","I received a ticket where the person said they could not delete a document.  No big deal, I tell her that sometimes if it is still open you may not be able to delete it, so please make sure it is closed.

She responds back that she isn't' stupid, and the file is not able to delete and there is something wrong with the system. 

Again, no problem, I go into the shared files and see the document is opened by her and close it.  It deletes with no problem after that. Took seconds.

I tell her that it is gone.  She wants to know what the issue was.  Not wanting to make her feel stupid, I say the file looked like it was open to the computer, so I closed it and it deleted with no problem.

That still wasn't good enough for her.  She wanted to know WHO had it open because it was a protected file and only SHE could have it open.  (I'm thinking to myself, that if only you could have it open, then who do you think opened it?)

I tried to be diplomatic and not tell her that it was open by her, so I just said some times when you close something it might just linger in the task manager after you've closed it or the share doesn't close on the server for some reason. 

STILL not good enough for her.  She doesn't think that's true and that I'm hiding who had the file open.  She demanded that I tell her who had the file open. 

I just closed the ticket and marked it solved.  I think she forgot about it, because I haven't heard from her again.  But I know it's coming.",345,0,1
When did you last restart it?,"The usual - user logs a ticket - VPN not working (a common issue since we've all been working from home in lockdown).

OK fine, I continue to uninstall &amp; reinstall and configure the VPN software again. No joy. I reinstall the previous VPN software we used, just in case, and try that. No joy.

She replied, I used the button. (Yeah, the power button, that puts it into sleep mode).  I said, let me show you how to do a restart.

"Why my webpage is not online, just because I didn't pay you?","I hope, this post belongs here, sorry if it should be somewhere else...

I run small IT company, our customers are generally happy with our services. If there is some problem, we try to fix it as soon as possible. I think, happy customer is great, because he can bring us more clients.

One of our services is web hosting. We run few servers for our clients without any problems. There is always at least one client of every IT company, who is just unhappy with everything. This client has just hosting with us. Few weeks ago was his hosting due to renew, so I send him the invoice over email and signed copy by mail (law in my country, you must have signed original). After few days his invoice by mail came back as undeliverable, so I did try to call him few times. He never answered any of my phone calls, never called back or answered to my emails.

Due day came and no answer or no payment, so I waited few more days and after that I canceled his services. I made backup of his account, as I do everytime just to be sure. His services was turned off.

Next day I get call from customer complaining, his webpage is not accessible and he is losing customers. I asked him his company name and sure, it was owner of that company. He demanded to bring his web page online at that moment. He was very angry.

So I said very calmly: ""Ok, it is not a problem, all you have to do is to give me your postal address and I send you the invoice by mail. There should be copy of your invoice in your email, you can pay that. After payment received, your services will be renewed.""

Sure enough, I get payment next day and his webpage was online 20 minutes after. All this could be avoided, if he paid in time. And it is like this last 3 years with the same customer.

A life lesson in asking the stupid questions first,"Gather round kids, it's story time.

Customer calls me:  The whole office can't get on the internet.  No one can reach any site, emails aren't coming in etc.

Backstory:  A few years prior customer was quoted $25k to pull a Comcast cable connection from the road all the way up to their office, the main building of a YMCA summer camp that was \~1 mile off the road.  Customer didn't have the funds (non-profit budget) and asked my company for a solution.

My boss wasn't the type to turn down work and in this case he probably should have but alas, he took the challenge.

We learned that the executive director's house which was down at the road COULD get Comcast.  So we got it installed and started preparing to get service up to the main building 1mile and over some rolling hills.

Step 1:  Buy an 2' tall outdoor antenna that is compatible with garbage consumer grade Netgear router my boss ordered.  Attached it to the router, ran it out the director's upstairs bedroom window and attached it to the house.

Step 2:  Do the same at the main office, hooked up the second router to the office network and attached the antenna to the building outside.

Step 3:  Test.  It sort of connects and we can browse but it keeps dropping off.

At this point this is all the hardware we have so they have to live with it for a little while we go back to the drawing board and buy more stuff.  Flakey cable that you have to reboot the routers on both ends is better than what they had before, dialup.

Step 4:  Order some sort of different router or maybe access point, also cheap Netgear and also can mount an external antenna.  I plug that in at their horse stable way up in the loft and run the antenna up to the roof.  Sidebar:  the stable was damp as hell and we went through a bunch of those devices before they got cable pulled up the hill.  It's halfway up the hill on the crest of the aforementioned hill so we figure both buildings will have line of sight to it and it should work.  Better, but not great.  Customer still doing reboots daily or more.  Has to drive down to director's house, reboot, drive to stable, reboot, drive to office reboot.

Step 5:  Added another hop in the bastardized WIFI chain at the building they house staff in between the stable and the office.  It's helped a bit, more reliable connection but still the same issue when there's a problem - someone now has to reboot 4 sets of gear.

So knowing all that I get this call they are down.  This isn't the first or last time I've had a call like that from them.  I ask if they did the reboots, yes.  Did you do them in the right order, yes.  Can you do it again before I drive over, yes.

Get over there, I'm connecting to the wifi and I can't figure out why I am seeing a Comcast splash screen that says something about registering.  It's a screen a new customer might see.  They've had service for a couple years now.  I have no internet to look it up, camp is in the middle of the woods so there's no cell service.  Nothing I can do to look anything up.  Finally after trying everything I can think of, wiping all the gear and reconfiguring, etc I decide to throw in the towel and call Comcast.  At that point I'd decided I had no choice and expected no help from them due to our weird bastardized setup.

Turns out 10 seconds on the line with them they told me what was wrong.

Terminated for non-payment.  So in the end the customer is down 2-3 days waiting for reconnection.  They had to pay late fees for the late bill, pay what they owed, pay a reconnection fee, and paid me \~3 hours at about $125/hr to troubleshoot it.

The useless bookkeeper they had at that point had a habit of printing off checks for bills, sticking them in the drawer and forgetting about them.  They found dozens when they fired him.  Some inbound checks they could have surely used the funds from (broke non-profit) but couldn't cash as they were too old.  And tons of vendors that didn't get paid remotely close to on time.",190,0,1

So, late one night, long ago, I was helping some friends move. I was cutting holes in the boxes, to make it easier to pick them up and carry them. The box cutter slipped, and I sliced my finger, almost going to the bone in the process.

As I’m trying to stop the bleeding, I get an emergency call from my manager. Hey, are you in town? “Clients” network is having problem’s, and I want you there to help. (As this site, was one of my main clients that I worked with the most.)

Looking down at my hand questioning if I needed to go get stitches, or if I could power through it. I decided that it was manageable, and I was close by to the client site. So, I told my manager that I was in town, and i'm heading over as we speak.

The client in question was a nursing care provider, with a dozen or so nurses always on site. As I walk in, I see one of the nurses that I had general classes with, in college. My manager and team were not there yet, so I walk up to him with my hand hidden.

Me = Me

N = Nursing student classmate

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Hey, I hear you are having problems around here with your network.

N: Yeah something is not working right, I don’t know what is going on, as I just started my shift.

Me: Well the rest of the team is on their way. Before I get to work, I have a question. (As I reveal my half bandaged up hand.) Can you look at this?

N: What did you do to yourself?

Me: Well, I cut myself...

N: I see that, but dude, you didn’t do this here, did you?

Me: Nope, I was helping a friend move, and the box cutter got away from me.

N: (As he looks at it.) Dude, you probably need stitches… You’re sure you didn’t do this here; I need to report it, if you did.

Me: No, I just got here myself. Can you just help me out here? I will be fine.

N: Well, I can wash it out better, we have steri strips, and better bandages, but you should really go in.

Me: Perfect, that’s all I want for now.

So, I get patched up. My manager and the others on the team arrive. Turns out, “network problems” was wireless phone system problems.

After about an hour of adjusting settings to the AP’s and testing, everything was working again. So, the clients problems got fixed, and I didn’t have to go to the ER. (Yes, I know I probably should have.)

It healed on its own, eventually… ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",149,0,1
Typical - we knew about this and telling you 10 minutes before hand that you need to set this up story.,"Setup: I had a bunch of vacation time saved to take early this summer before my time renewed (doesn't carry over).  With everything going on I haven't been able to take the time more so since one of our staff requested a layoff.  Anyway we where able to come up with i'll take fridays off and use up most of the time while still doing basic stuff on the phone or emergencies.  At the time there was no where to go out to anyway so....

One of these fridays i get a call at about 930 or so...

&gt; `user`: our audio system isn't working for the meeting?!

&gt; `me`: did you try turning it off and on again? `literally`

&gt; `user`: yes

I believe her cause we go through this couple times a year and she calls me while she's rebooting it and when its finished it works...

&gt; `me`: okay when is this meeting?

&gt; `user`: 10

&gt; `me` : really? you call me at 930 for a 1000 meeting and i'm half an hour away?  .... i'll be in.. delay them.

I put pants on and a t-shirt that says `my liver is evil and must be punished` and get there in a bout 20 minutes meeting was just starting.

The mics are all working... i'm like what the hell... really?  I walk right through the middle of the hall in front of the conference camera mind the shirt that isn't appropriate for a government meeting and ask her how/why the mics where working.

&gt; `user`: `AVUser` fixed it 

she points back over the other side of the room I just came from where `AVUser` is.  He knows his AV stuff.. had i known he was there i would have just called him.

I walk back over right through the middle again to the `AVUser`

&gt; `me` : so what was broken?

&gt; `AVUser` : I don't know, i just turned it off and on again

I gave `user` a dirty look and stared her down on my way out.  I called a vendor to try to replace her but turns out hard to replace an elected official with a vendor.  working on a shell script though, i have high hopes.

[EDIT]: you people complaining about working on vacation time.  Haven't you done things to help your community healthy and fed during the past few months?  That is what we are trying to do at the moment thanks to many of our employees helping out in little bits like this or actively in the public we have mostly succeeded.... so far....anyway.  Normal circumstances i'm with ya more... but the world is on fire and we need people to dump a cup of water on it..  anyway.. thats that.. this isn't a post about vacation time.. its a post about frustration with a user who didn't call be back to say it was fixed.",859,0,1
of moving,"$me: obvious

$mt: migration team

&amp;#x200B;

So, last Monday $mt were going to move around some of the desktops as to create a corona-proof environment.

The idea was to move 5 workspaces into another room and create 3 more. This morning I arrive early and I check:

6 have no working network connection. The remaining 2 are standing desks, one is missing a mouse, one is missing the card reader.

Total of working workspaces: exactly zero.

UPDATE:

Had an interesting convo with my project leader. It seems the project leader responsible for the move indeed has not been communicating AT ALL with the networking guys. It turns out, the drops in the new area are originally telecoms drops. So the patch panels are in the telecoms room. With no client switches near them. Something tells me this will takes a few more weeks to get solved. Good thing half the personnel still works from home, otherwise the available workspaces would be nowhere near enough.

""Can I please use a cattle prod to make the migration PL into a BlinkenLichten?""

UPDATE 2:

They managed to get 2 workspaces functional. The rest still have no network.

UPDATE 3: still 2 that need to be converted into something working. ! still has a non-functional card reader.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: moving is hard, talking is harder.",146,0,1
Little town market Printer Fix = Beer (just a few hours ago),"I go into my local small market/deli here in the boonies.. tracking down my debit card which figured out that i'd forgotten to get it back last time I was shopping there..  because i'm an idiot.. so turns out Shelly's (one of the workers) got it, been holding it for me .. i'm looking for her and doing a little shopping.. the owner Jake is there and he's all .. hey man how's it going.. I tell him how stupid I am and looking for Shelly for my debit card.  

I'm a known geek/it guy so he's like well let me find her.  Also my printer doesn't work and I got a lot of shit to print .. can you check it out?

Sure.

So OMG.. he's got maybe 30-40 queued print jobs on this wifi epson combo scanner printer.. quickbooks shit.. employee stuff.. the man needs to prints some stuff.  Also his wife just had a baby this saturday and we're about 20 mins  from closing and he needs to get home.

So .. do the usual.. there is absolutely no reason why this thing won't print .. network is fine (turned it off and on yada yada), printer is showing no errors in win10.. it's settings are right for the network .. so on  .. 

Then we go to the usual steps.. delete all the jobs.. test print.. nowt.. ok fuck you printer.. remove printer .. reinstall.. maybe 15 mins overall

BAM printer works again. I'm like dude.. you gotta resend the print jobs but it works now.   We find Shelly .. get my card back and he hands me a half-case of hop valley IPA for my time.  Man I love my little town.  I'm drinking one now

I'm sorry but where did you get that address from?,"Afternoon TFTS!

So, the following snippet took place about an hour ago before I went on lunch. To provide some context we are performing a massive infrastructure upgrade from a Server 2003 SBS server to a group of Azure servers, Office 365 and Intune management.

TL:DR - Customer typed in our website IT support address wrong, claimed it was right, needed me to tell her which office apps to use and show her the icons

I need the technical details!,"I’ve got another one for you guys, a tale as old as time, customer communication having more in common with inaudible squeaks than actual information regarding the issue. 

To preface I received a ticket regarding an order of Chromebooks from the department of education and that the finance officer needed the “technical details” for the form. The ticket mentioned a high level of urgency. Which already irked me because it’s my job to decide urgency and escalate as needed. I put this to the side because our student end server was failing and that was much more pivotal. After about three hours, and received a second ticket from our Operations manager, who we’ll call “Ellen”, asking for urgent help regarding the issue. I respond politely telling her that we are having server issues and that it takes urgency right now, i then merge the ticket with the first one. For reference we have a full 24 hours before our first response is “late” in company policy. I eventually sort the issue with the server as it ending up being a simple conflict of software that stopped it from interacting with our LAN. So after being huddled in a cold server room for hours messing with switches and our server terminal, I sit back and relax with a coffee for about five minutes. Then Ellen bursts into my office.

Ellen: Hello The_Neko_King, You’ve been sent many emails and tickets regarding the technical details for the DfE. It’s urgent it needs to be done now. 

(Didn’t send a single email to me but rather our senior field engineer.)

Me: Okay, well luckily enough I’ve sorted our previous business with insight and liaised with talk straight regarding our network hitching. First I’ll need you to clarify what “technical details” mean. 

Ellen: I don’t know you’re the tech guy this is what your company is contracted for. 

Me: fair enough I’ll get in contact with SFE to find out. In the mean time please send me the field of the form you need to send out.

Ellen: okay, but it needs to be done by the end of today.

(Me internally screaming as my shift is up in 30 mins.)

Frantically, I call up our field engineer who’s been at this site far longer than me and ask him for advice.

Me: You alright mate? Could you give me a hand with the (school ID) tickets that came through. Ellen’s breathing down my neck and I haven’t got a clue what “technical details” are could mean anything.

SFE: What? Technical details, I haven’t got a clue buddy. 

(Autotask goes ping)
(SFE is now laughing)

Me: it’s not funny mate! I wanna be home in an hour...

SFE: look at the ticket. 

They’ve finally sent me the form and the field is “school email domain”

Me: are they r*******?

SFE: yes.

Two people. Who have been using email software for OVER A DECADE. Don’t know their domain despite seeing it for the better part of FIVE YEARS. the worst part technical details don’t appear on the form or the order acquisition letter ONCE. I complete the ticket and you bet I charged the school for every single second I spent calling, talking, responding through autotask, discussing with Ellen and searching through our active directory for “technical details” as well as my 5 minute coffee break.

Edit: The worst part Ellen has a degree in ICT",208,0,1
Sales reps who assume we are their puppets,"So, one of our sales reps called into support today stating ""customer X has a phone not working, please fix that now"".

ahem:

1) we normally need a ticket for anything... he didn't create one.  
ok, i will accept that, i can make one on the fly.

2) for any issue on customer premises, we need contact with the customer.  
the sales rep is not on site, he just got a call from the customer.

So, instead of telling the customer to call us (which would be the normal procedure),  
this sales rep is just at some random place, got a call from that customer, and then calls us to tell us to call this customer and ""just fix it"".

I set up the system to allow password retrieval, so all that's needed now is for the customer to reset the phone so it retrieves it settings anew.  
Pretty basic, and since there is 0 information about the issue from the sales rep, all i can do.   
I tell this to the sales rep, and tell him to call the customer to reset his phone.

just 3 minutes later this sales rep is back on my line.  
Obviously he was hoping for another guy to try this ""help customer X now"" play again, but since he got me, he was out of luck... so just claimed that in 3 minutes time he had called the customer, had him reset the phone, the phone had booted, and he called back in to us. (he hadn't - a reset takes around 5 minutes for the phone itself).

So, i tell him that if he did and it still didn't work, he should inform the customer to call us directly.

You could hear him not being happy by actually being told to follow procedure (which in the end would be better for him, us, and the customer) and the call ends.

4!! hours later i see a ticket coming in from this sales rep.... ""customer X has a phone that isn't working,  fix it"".

"""What do you mean I can't print?""","Hi guys,

First time posting here. I'm on mobile so formatting might be off. Also, English is not my first language so feel free to correct me for any errors. ^_^

$Lady: How do I print?
$Me: After you publish, you click Download and select PDF for print.

The Miracle of Gary,"I posted some time ago about how I maintain a website for my company. Our users (mostly internal staff) need to log into the website to do part of their job.

This morning I got a call from Sandra in sales. She asked me some questions about the website and about user accounts. In particular she wanted to know if multiple people could access the same account at the same time or if there was some sort of limit. I told her that there was no such limit.

Sandra then instructed me to delete all the individual accounts for users in sales and to create a single account 'sales' to be used by everyone (dozens of people) in her department.

That sounded extremely strange to me, so I asked why, but she wouldn't give me a straight answer and just asked if it was possible or not. I thought maybe there was some issue with the way their individual accounts were set up, maybe the data they saw was somehow not synced, but she told me that they could use their accounts just fine.

I kept insisting, because it sounded like a bad idea and I didn't want to do it. After some more pointless back and forth, she finally told me ""Our accounts are fine, it's Gary who's the problem!""

It turns out that this Gary is not very tech-savvy, even for the standards of our not-very-tech-savvy company. Sandra told me that he kept messing things up, losing his password, and so on. This had culminated in Gary deleting a very important document yesterday, and so Sandra had decided that he couldn't be trusted with his own account. So... she wanted a single account for all her people. Which Gary would (obviously) also have access to.

At this point, I explained politely but firmly that this would not solve her Gary problem, because he could do just as much damage with a generic sales account as with his own personal account. Moreover, if he messed things up, he would mess it up for the entire team. I told her that me or tech support could revert changes made by Gary (or anyone) if they had made a mistake, but there wasn't much more I could do to stop him deleting files.

Sandra (who's senior to me) was not best pleased and decided to pull my manager into it, telling him I was obstructing her department or something silly like that. My manager had a good laugh when I explained the situation, then he called Sandra and pretty much repeated what I'd told her, letting her know that there was going to be no 'sales' account, ever. He then told Sandra that we (technical dept) were available if anyone needed extra training, but everyone must use their own account and be accountable if they messed up.

I've been working in this field for 5+ years and this was easily one of my most satisfying moments.

&amp;#x200B;

ETA because I only now remembered the title: The miracle is that my manager immediately shut her down, my previous bosses would have told me to get on with it and then later I'd have to fix whatever problems had been caused by the shared account. In my previous jobs I never got any fallout (remember kids, always get email confirmation when asked to do stupid shit!) but it's not funny to fix a mess when you know you could've prevented it from happening in the first place.",337,0,1
Does anyone read my emails?,"Context:  I work for the largest restaurant focused MSP in the US (according to our management).  We do a LOT of point-of-sale support, including credit card and gift card processing.

One of our chains uses a certain godless processor for giftcards.  They have problems with their processing servers, which tend to have issues around busy times.  During the holidays, they go down every weekend.  The part that is \*extremely\* odd is that it impacts certain sites, but not others.  Still haven't figure that part out yet.  Either way, it's a network error showing that they cant make a connection to a specific address.  We'll call it 'ssl.godless.gc.'  The fun part is that they use a CDN of some sort, so you're not always reaching out to the same IP, but all IPs appear to have the same issue, and route to the same data center.

Week before Christmas, 2019:

Gift cards go down again, and I'm pulling my hair out because I cant figure out what's wrong.  Finally, ask my overnight supervisor who has been here for a few years, ""Oh, yeah, this happens every Christmas.  Everyone seems to forget.  It's the processor.  They just suck.""  This is important, because the overnight supervisor has very little contact with the rest of the team.  He generally just gets things done and never has a reason to communicate with day shift.

I decide to try to call the processor.  They cant locate the account that I'm calling about, give me a quick ""Please attempt to locate the correct account number"" and promptly hang up on me.  I call again, with the correct account number, and this is what follows:

&gt;Support: ""We don't have any problems on our end.  I recommend you call your point-of-sale support.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I am POS support.  The problem isn't on our end.  
&gt;  
&gt;Support: ""Oh.  You should call &lt;restaurant technology company&gt;.""  
&gt;  
&gt;Me:  Why would I call &lt;restaurant technology company&gt;?  
&gt;  
&gt;Support: ""They can help you verify your configuration settings.  Have a nice day!""  
&gt;  
&gt;\*click\*

Not even joking, that is very nearly verbatim what went down.  Godless processors support seems to be there more for show than actual support.

I went ahead and relayed what happened to my (daytime) supervisor and the client.  Now, it's important to understand that we don't support every store that has this problem.  Some of them are under a different MSP.  What follows next blew my mind.

Email from other IT company, to us and corporate (paraphrased):

&gt;We did a tracert to &lt;problem server&gt; from a few stores.  The tracert stops after &lt;major ISP hop&gt;.  We believe the problem is with &lt;major isp&gt;.  We've attempted to reach out to them, but getting them to change or analyze routing is difficult.

I sat back a little stupefied.  After some checking, I verified that not all stores are on the same ISP, the routes were different because of major regional differences, and they all stopped at the border of the processor network.  My conclusion was wildly different:  The processor has ICMP responses disabled to external, and the other IT company doesn't understand how tracert works.  Not only that, I've worked for an ISP.  If there's a routing problem, and you can identify the hop for them, they'll usually gladly look into it.  It's not hard at all.

I explained this over email, CC'd my team, and re-reached the already known conclusion that it was the processor, not the ISP.

Fast forward a month, more outages.  This time, one of the tickets makes it to the head of our IT side of things.  He starts conferring with their corporate, and they send an email asking, ""What is being done to resolve this with &lt;major isp&gt;?""  I end up on a call with him and lay out the scenario.  He proceeds to drill down into our firewalls, the ISPs and routes, and comes to the conclusion, it's the processor.  He sends a **5 lengthy paragraphs** email explaining his findings, and recommending they change processors.  Corporate never responds, and the ticket is closed.

This problem continues to pop-up nearly weekly.  At one point, I send a lengthy email to my boss and everyone I work with asking if they have any ideas about getting it resolved.  Maybe we can collect data that will force the processor to admit there's an issue, or maybe find a contact with them that is more useful that support.

*crickets*

A couple months go by, much of which is characterized by a lack of things to do due to covid.  Many of our restaurants are re-opening, and business is picking back up.  Suddenly, this same issue rears it's ugly head.  Multiple restaurants are having issues on the weekend.  One of our network guys gets involved, along with one of our senior POS guys.  I advise them that it's the processor and no amount of fiddling will resolve it.

They end up playing around with the firewalls, and push some changes.  Lo and behold, the problem is resolved.... for 1 week.  The next week, more problems, with greater scale.  I advise again, the firewall probably had nothing to do with it; it was likely just coincidence that it started working shortly after making changes.  They spend the next week beating their heads against it, and finally, today, I see an email.  ""We've ruled out the firewall and concluded that it's the processor.""

Corporate response, ""Thanks, we'll look into the processor.""

How to acess the Acess DB...,"This one is ages old. It was in the dark old days prior to my 1st Microsoft Certification.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just started as the new guy in a consulting company after i left the university. The thankless job that noone wanted to touch was an access db and the task was to implement a 4th level of ""Notice"" so outstanding bills could be sent to a collection agency for processing and the account for the user . This project already killed the 2 previous owners and there was never a hand off to know whats going on, so basically the perfect opportunity to learn swimming...

I have been working a bit on this and my boss wanted to check on my progress, but i was not in... Once i got back in he pinged me about the project... He said he wanted to check my progress, but he could not access the DB anymore. He checked the users table where all our user and passwords were located, but for the world of it he could not figure out how to decode them. He said he spend a whole day trying to figure out how i did it, since access has no real ""password fields"" in its schema.

It turned him mad that he could not get past my password encryption.

I asked him what he was talking about... And he told me all passwords in the user table now showed as ""\*\*\*\*\*\*"" and he could not decode it. He could find the function call anywhere and he thought that access had no password fields...

&amp;#x200B;

Well... I had to disappoint him... The customer provided their DB with unencrypted passwords... So I just overwrote them all with ""\*\*\*\*\*\*"" since i didnt want to have the burdon of caring/knowing their passwords ;) Any user could log in with ""\*\*\*\*\*\*""",151,0,1
One Button Solution,"In the early 90s I was hired as the IT Manager for a DC organization. Their #3 decided we needed a network so we installed a Novell Netware 3.12 network **using existing telephone wiring from the 1960s in order to save money!** (That wasn't my choice!)

But, the main point of this story is to talk about the CEO, an old fart if ever there was one, who read somewhere that computers would allow you ""one button access to your data."" (Thanks marketing a-holes.)

So, he demanded that his computer - he'd never used one - be configured so that he simply had to push one button on the keyboard and whatever he requested would appear. I asked him what he wanted to appear and he said ""Whatever I need.""

In other words, he insisted the network be able to read his mind after pushing the ""one button"" which would then print out what he needed. I explained that our network wasn't clairvoyent to which he said ""I approved the purchase of this equipment because I was told it would allow one-button access to the information I need.""

My solution, which, I'm very sorry to say worked, was to go to Radio Shack and buy a Sonalert buzzer which I hardwired to his keyboard. Any key he pressed would cause the Sonalert to sound at his admin assistant's desk who would, by virtue of her knowing everything that he needed and having the patience of a saint, then print his report and bring it in to him.",1154,0,1

A few years ago (around 2015?), we are preparing to transition into a dual-stacked, IPv4 CGNAT configuration for our fixed-lined residential users (DSL and fiber deployments). We have verified that our equipment from the router/modem that we provided to the backbone is ready, test runs are done, support staff are well-prepared, we mailed our tech-savvy users (who oftentimes have their own infrastructure and wouldn't liked to have surprises on network changes), announce the planned changes (mainly CGNAT deployment and we asked people to opt-out on CGNAT if they have home servers or Xbox and PlayStation consoles), rolled-out to the tech-savvy audience (which helped us solved some edge-case issues), and re-announced again that we will be deploying dual-stacked IPv6 + CGNATted IPv4 (this time with much clearer guidance intended for novices and another call to opt-out if they have internet-facing home servers or game consoles).

We have decided to deploy the changes in the early hours of Saturday, since that we figured that most users will notice any edge-case breakages on Saturday due to simply having increased usage at the time. We have warned again that internet connectivity will be disrupted at around 3-6 in the morning for these changes to be applied. Additionally, we have prepared our support staff (and the associated overtime pays and legal covers) for this change.

At exactly 03:30, we have remotely power-cycled all the routers to ensure that the change would be applied. Calls have increased, but only either for last-minute opt-outs to CGNAT (we have warned them already) or angry persons that thought that we provide fully uninterrupted service (again, we have announced this, we would accommodate them if necessary but they haven't warned us either). Enter this particular call:

&gt;**Level 1 Support:** Good morning, this is ABC Networks, how may I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** Our XYZ security camera have stopped.

This case would be normally be a non-issue, but since we have made significant changes, it was passed on to us, and since I was the most senior one available, to me.

&gt;**NotATimeWarper:** Good morning, I have assumed that you have restarted the cameras?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** Yes, but all of them is still not working and are blinking red.  
&gt;  
&gt;**NotATimeWarper:** (checks if XYZ has problems and found it is fine) Can we check your modem remotely?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** Yes, please fix this immediately, this would be a large problem if it is your fault.  
&gt;  
&gt;**NotATimeWarper:** Please leave the cameras on so that we can check if the problem is indeed ours.

Then the services manager (which manages our DNS servers among other things) sent a message:

&gt;**Internal:SM:** Wait, i *\[sic\]* thought you guys are going DS? Why are the queries requesting for a NAT64 server?

For those not familiar, there are ways to accomplish IPv6 transition, and NAT64 is designed for IPv6-only networks who still needs to send data to IPv4 networks (which is nearly everyone), but we have both IPv6 and IPv4 anyway so NAT64 is redundant.

&gt;**Internal:NotATimeWarper:** What? Can you send the AAAA logs?

For those not familiar with DNS, AAAA records are requests for IPv6 servers (as opposed to A records, which contains IPv4 records). After seeing the logs, I sent to SM a single word

&gt;**Internal:NotATimeWarper:** Wow!

Mystery solved. XYZ company is apparently too lazy to have proper IPv6 deployed to their servers and instead rely that every ISP who has deployed IPv6 have NAT64 that uses the common prefix `64:ff9b::/96`. Not only it breaks NAT64 for those ISPs who have deployed it at private prefixes, the cameras themselves were too lazy to check if IPv4 connectivity exists. Now I would want to call XYZ now, but we have to temporarily fix the problem for our customer.

&gt;**NotATimeWarper:** Customer, we will make changes due to your problem with your XYZ cameras. Can we disconnect this call temporarily and call you later when we fixed this problem?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Customer:** Oh, yes, thank you! But please call back immediately or we will switch our internet connection to your competitor DEF!

With a sigh, I asked SM to filter all AAAA requests that resolves to `64:ff9b::/96` from our DNS servers, called back the unlucky customer back to manually restart the modem and cameras (which fixed the problem), and put a note to send a formal complaint to XYZ company and their lazy approach for supporting IPv6-only users.

Around two weeks later, XYZ has formally fixed the problem: remove any IPv6 support and rely on IPv4. Problem solved, I guess?

Your iPad's a paperweight,"So back in the day (before I started my **real** tech support career) I was working at a certain shack that sold electronics as a retail pleb- after a year of working there I had gained a reputation as the resident 'tech guy' and people would start coming to me for free advice because I'm nice and wouldn't mind answering questions. 

Me = me, CM = Customer

**ring ring ring ring** 

&gt;Me: Hello, MicrowaveShack, this is BaileyTheNerd

&gt;CM: Hey man, I bought this iPad at a garage sale, but it's not turning on, any chance I can bring it in and see if we can find a charger for it? 

&gt;Me: Sure, I have every usb cable you could want, we'll get you sorted out. 

*2 hours later* 

&gt;CM: So, here's the iPad, I tried using my daughter's iPad cable, but it wouldn't even charge, maybe the charger's bad? 

(He hands me the 'iPad') 

&gt;Me: So, sir, how much did you spend on this iPad? 

&gt;CM: $10, why? 

&gt;Me: Well, I think I found the problem. 

&gt;CM: What is it???? 

Using my leatherman, I pry open the 'iPad' at the seam 

&gt;CM: DUDE WHAT THE HELL 

(I pull out the steel weight in the dummy iPad)

&gt;Me: Somebody replaced all of the electronics in your iPad with a weight! 

&gt;Cm: ... 

&gt;Me: Yeah, it was just a dummy/demo iPad my dude. 

&gt;CM: Get what you pay for I gues... 

tl;dr- Dummy bought a dummy.

[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/gvo2ps/bad_architecture_part_5_lawtechie_learns_more/)

tl;dr- I'm a contractor at Large Client(LC). I'm helping them remediate audit findings in a difficult environment. I recently got my hands on the audit. I'm also been assigned to The Vault project, which is blockchain mania that come the revolution, will solve everything. 
  

I think that the Vault is vaporware. I'm wondering how many people know. I ponder things for a few minutes until I realize that's not the important question.   
  
The real question is ""what's it to me?""  
  
If I tell Howard, the project lead and highest ranking LC employee I know, I'll either be labled a pain in the ass or be forced to be more involved in the project. Lose/lose.  
  


From my point of view, the Vault actually isn't relevant. It's not operational, so it can't have audit findings. Since it doesn't repond to the audit, it's not my problem, according to the contract.  
  

  
Speaking of contracts, I'd like to have some _proof_ that I did things. We're going to need findings closed.   
  
And I'm going to keep my mouth shut. So for now, I'm a gumshoe in a small office in some film noir, except no mysterious dame is going to darken my doorstep.   
  
I'm going to find issues and close them. 
  
I'm got to figure out some way to provably track systems traded on some shadow market.  
  
And I have a login to the Slack channel where it happens.  
  
The Slack seems to have a handful of closed channels. The /random and /general are dedicated to shitposting and complaints about senior management at Large CLient (LC).  
  
I leave it open. I start reading the audit report. It's not like any professional audit report I've ever read. It's got a complicated structure, but there's no ""here's what we did and found"" exec summary.    
  
Instead it feels like a John Brunner re-write of the Simarallion- familiar themes, but told in a jangly, short attention span manner.  
  
And nobody cares about the characters to remember their names.  
  
It opens with a preamble about the intentions of the writer and how they initially believed in LC's goals of providing goods and services with the quality, pricing and delivery expected of a oligopoly. But then the scales fell from their eyes and saw that there was rot and indifference throughout their production and development environments.  
  
Then there were findings. Lots and lots of findings. Some make sense, others are rants labeled as findings.  
  
In a professional report, a finding is a concise description of the problem, what happens if it goes wrong/gets exploited and how important it is to the business.  
  
Our writer also includes backstory.   
  
As an example:  
  
**Finding 252**: Incorrect and non-compliant Time Servers.  
  
**Description** LC's Operations Lead has picked wrong time servers. They have picked time servers in the EU instead of North America.   
  
**Risk** HIGH. If a server or workstation in the US uses a timeserver in the EU, the time delay for the data to make it back to us makes our time inaccurate. Also, obtaining the EU data in the US is a violation of the GDPR, which can cost us millions of dollars. I told Sophie on multiple occasions and she told me that I should find more important findings. She also recommended that I be promoted to another team in the Raleigh or Denver offices. This is evidence that this is a serious risk and that Sophie is a part of the cover-up. 

And there are hundreds of these findings. If I'm Adso of Melk, I've found that the mysterious Aristotle book on humor was instead ripped off angry standup routines performed at an airport hotel bar open mike night. 
  
Now I have a map. I can pick issues to close and actually ~~fix~~ cross items off a list. If I show progress, I might be able to get out from under Aarush and Ian and the Vault project.  
  
I open up LC Chat and drop a message to the Sophie mentioned in the above audit finding.  
  
me:""Sophie. I'm LawTechie and I'm trying to close out some audit findings. Do you have a minute?""  
  
No response.  
  
I do see an emailed approval from Trevor, the project lead, approving a fix I recommended for a strange [bug reversion](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/galiq9/bad_architecture_part_3_digging_deeper/). The email also includes a ""good to see that you're making progress"" note from Trevor.
  
Yay. I can scratch one audit finding off. Several hundred more to go.  
  
I realize I might be able to fix two problems today. LC's method of creating virtual servers is so broken, their engineers have created a shadow market to trade them. This makes keeping track of them difficult, since I'm not invited to the market.  
  
Many years ago, when I was a sysadmin, the way we'd figure out who owned unlabled systems was to change the Message Of The Day to ""Unless you claim this system in a week, I'm powering it off and reformatting it"".  
  
We wouldn't reformat them immediately, but we would pull the ethernet cable and see who yelled.   
  
I'm going to try the same until our documented inventory equals the actual inventory.  
  
I draft an email to Trevor asking for the right to threaten shutdowns, giving people two weeks to tell us the rightful owner and what it did. He responds with a ""let me get air-cover""  
  
Thanks, Bomber Command.  
  
I get a response from Sophie.  
  
Sophie:""What audit are you referring to and what is this about?""  
  
me:""It's the large one. You're referenced in finding 252, about time servers""  
  
Sophie:""...""  
Sophie:""...""   
Sophie:""...""   
  
  
Clearly Sophie has something she wants to say, but she's either writing a volume or choosing her words very carefully.  
  
Sophie:""That asshole""  
  
Carefully chosen.   
  
me:""I see. It seemed ridiculous, but I had to ask just in case you were a part of the great time server conspiracy""  
  
Sophie:""...""   
  
Sophie:""You're making a joke. Don't. Nobody finds this funny""  
  
me:""I don't understand. What firm did this audit so I never recommend them?""  
  
Sophie:""It was internal""  
  
me:""Internal audit wrote this?""  
  
Sophie:""No. Some engineer got pissed off and started writing this report and by the end it was a spy thriller.""  
  
me:""So they fired them?""  
  
Sophie:""No. They moved him to a new project. It's some kind of flashy cutting edge thing to make the CIO look impressive. I don't pay attention until it affects my budget""  
  
me:""Why'd they move him?""  
  
Sophie:""Well, I think management wasn't sure what else to do""  
  
me:""Makes sense- if you fire him, he's a whistleblower. Keep him on the team, it sows discord. Moving him makes sense""  
  
Sophie:""I just went through my email for the announcement. Ian got moved to a project called the Vault""  
  
me:...""

What a Waste of the Environment,"Here's a guy who was *way* ahead of his time in that he was concerned about the environment and wasting paper. This happened in 1998. I was the chief IT guy for the organization.

A VP (nice guy, older, and not too tech-savvy) at a branch office came to our headquarters for a meeting and dragged a large box of papers into the boardroom. The box easily had the equivalent of 3-4 reams of paper in it.

He immediately started berating me for ""wasting all this paper"" and ""unnecessarily destroying trees."" Asking him to explain himself he showed me all the papers in the box which were nothing but emails.

It turns out he never used his computer. He told his admin assistant to print his emails so he could read them. Thousands of them over the course of a year. He didn't seem to get the point why he should just **read them himself** and not bother printing them.",1228,0,1
It's not what I'm paying for but make it better,"Background: 

I work in back office support for an internet service provider in my country. My job generally involves helping customers as I can over the phone and if it's something that needs to be done in person I'll dispatch technicians to investigate the customers lines and equipment in the home.

Often times get customers calling to demand technicians to come in person over issues that can honestly be solved by either turning a modem off and on again or something like the customers TV being on the wrong input settings etc. These are sometimes amusing and I have a lot of stories but the one that happened the other day is by far the most amazing.

A customer called me to complain that his internet has been ridiculously slow over the past few days and he wanted someone to come and look into the issue.

After getting the customers information I pull up his account and modem on the system and after pinging the modem I notice that there are no issues as far as I can detect. 

So I try to get more information from the customer. Usually you find out that the customer is struggling because they're using some website to pirate shitty low quality movies or they are on a low bandwidth package and trying to run 2 PS4s and stream on 5 other devices at the same time.

The conversation is as follows.

Me: How long has this been an issue sir

Him: over the past two or three days

Me: *checks his account to see the data plan he is currently paying for  *Well sir I see you are on the minimum plan at the moment. when you do a speed test what results do you get"" 

Him: When I do a test I am pulling *gives speed for our maximum plan*

Me: .... I'm sorry sir can you repeat that 

Him: I'm getting the maximum plan speeds 

Me: Sir... are you aware that you are paying for our minimum plan.

Him: Yes I am aware but I'm getting maximum speed and it is still slow so can you please bump it up more then 

Me: Sir... you're aware that you're getting the maximum speed plans while paying for minimum speeds and asking me to give you more speed? 

Him: yes because your internet is so slow and I need more

Me: well... what issue are you having exactly? 

Him: Everyone on youtube and anything else works fine but my messages are taking a long time to send.

Me: Well sir I'm sorry but that issue would be with your messaging app and not the internet service.

Him: Can you make my internet faster anyway so the messages will send

Me: Well... I'm going to have to resync your modem on the system so you get the speeds you're actually paying for. 

Him: Why would you do that when the internet is slow 

Me: Because that's what you're actually paying for? 

Him: that's not what I asked you to do.

Me: Well it's what I need to do sir. if you have any issues you can always apply for our maximum package. 

Him: BUT THATS NOT WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO 

Me: Well I'm sorry sir but that's what I'm doing. please have a nice day.

Email Jollies,"I was the IT Director for a large company starting in 2000. It was a great job but there were some fun times getting things organized.

Each division had its own network before I got there and migrated everything to one. This one division was still using Lotus Notes strictly for email. The division president was a nice guy but thought he knew more than he did. (!)

For example, his laptop kept crashing and he couldn't figure out why. But, he wouldn't let us look at it because he didn't want anyone else to see his confidential financial info. Ohhhh-kayyyy...

Finally found out why it was crashing when he made an off-handed comment to his assistant about emailing his backups to his home AOL email address. It turns out he was trying to email his entire C: drive to his home email. I didn't care *how* he was trying to do it. I just told him: ""Stop.""

Same guy wanted to access his email in real time while flying coast to coast. (Keep in mind he's asking in  early 2000.) I told him with tongue firmly planted in-cheek I didn't think we had any network cables long enough to reach his plane.

The Broken iPad,"So...

I used to work in IT tech support for one of the UKs largest medical care providers. We provided 75% of the staff with iPads, to access information. Now, a lot of the time we don't have any problems, other than the occasional cracked screen. However one time we did have, a seriously odd one...  


So, a very sweet nurse called our support department, claiming that her iPad wouldn't turn on. So as standard procedure, we asked her to come up to the office where we had a loner iPad that we could quickly replace her's with, whilst it was being looked at. When she arrived with us, she was showing us, how her Ipad wasn't working. After a quick look at her device, we noticed she had it back to front. So... we proceed to turn it over so we can look at the screen. which worked perfectly fine. It was at this point, she exclaimed: ""I wondered why the back was flashing when I pressed the power button, and why the power button had switched sides."" Well, my colleague and I were both totally speechless that this point, as she left us, thanking us for fixing her iPad.   


TLDR - Sweet old lady complains about broken iPad screen, only to find out shes using it back to front.",1375,0,1
"""Broken"" document camera","I volunteer to provide tech support for a small private school.  

When covid started and school went remote, we quickly realized that a webcam + whiteboard won't cut it, so I quickly acquired some used document cameras for teachers who didn't have one already (they already had mini whiteboards, to hold under the cameras).     

I tested every single camera before dropping them off for teachers to pick up, with the right wire + power cable for each projector (there were 2 kinds of models). 

A few weeks later, during a tech hours virtual meeting, one of these teachers complains that ""my camera doesn't work"", so I'm just taking pictures on my phone, emailing them to myself, downloading them to from my computer, opening them up, and then sharing the screen.  

I was surprised she was doing this whole flow and didn't mention her camera was ""broken"".   

So I setup a remote call with her. I had a hunch what it could be: the model she has supports projecting from either the ""camera"", or from a USB flash drive, and there's a switch on the side to choose which one. I had set the switch correctly, but it was possible she bumped it in the other direction.   

Call starts, she shares her screen, and opens up the app for the projector and it says ""projector not detected"". So I ask her to ensure the projector is turned on, and plugged in to the laptop. 

She says ""yes it's on, and plugged in, but the wire is a bit loose"". I ask her to see if wiggling the wire helps. No go. 

""Is it loose where it plugs in to the camera, or where it plugs in to the laptop""? The wire in question  is a micro USB.  

""Well, the problem is on the laptop side""  

""Can you try plugging into another USB port on the laptop""?  

""Well, the other port is also **too big**.""  

Bewildered, I ask her to show me on camera. So we switch to a video call using her phone, and she shows me which USB port is ""too big"". 

Any guesses?

.     

.    

.  

.

.  

She shows me the small end of the microUSB ""plugged in"" to a regular full size USB A female port. 
The other end (USB A male) was plugged in to the USB A female port on the camera meant for flash drives.     

Since I was on camera myself, it took a lot of deep breathing not to laugh.   

I took a few breaths to compose myself, and explain that the ""small end"" of the cable goes into the similar port on the camera, and the ""big end"" should go in the computer instead.     

There are many other stories from this unique set of teachers, but this is the most recent one. Hope you enjoyed it, as much as I did.",137,0,1
He's an essential worker!,"Hey guys,

long time lurker, first time poster. I work tech support for one of Canada's big 3 in the cell phone department. I get a call from this guy yesterday (Saturday) at around 5pm EST. Now he's in Newfoundland which means it's about 6:30pm his time. He calls up in a huff because one of his truck drivers dropped and broke his phone, so he drove an hour and a half to the closest open store near him to get it repaired only be directed to call in as none of our stores are doing repairs at this time.

Here comes the best part, the guy states he's got 5 lines with us, has been with us a couple of years, and because his driver is an essential worker he's demanding we get a new phone in his driver's hands by Monday or he's cancelling his services. I tell buddy that I'll look into the options and put him on hold. I then proceed to look at all the lines. All 5 are just over 2 months into new contracts with $1000+ remaining balance on the devices. Given the circumstances, he'd be hard pressed to find someone willing to waive any of that, so it's at this point I know if he switches, he's looking at over $5000 in cancellation fees he'd owe for his account. It really bothers me when people like this threaten to cancel because they feel entitled to not have to follow the same procedure everyone else has to go by, so I take him off hold, and provide him his options (get the repair done through normal procedures, or cancel and owe over $5000). He doesn't like them, of course, so I tell him in nicer words that his request is ridiculous with regards to his demands and the deadline.

Because the phone is unusable we can supply his driver with a loaner phone, but he thinks the 3-5 business day shipping time is ridiculous and too long, but will go with it because it needs to get done. After I finish booking the repair and loaner phone he tells me he wants to go back to the store and get a loaner from them. I inform him the store is not a standard repair store and wouldn't have any loaner stock, he gets mad, demands his repair number, and says he'll make sure the store gives him one. \*click\*

Good luck with that, jackass.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Truck driver breaks his phone. His boss threatens to cancel all his lines if we can't get a new phone in driver's hands in the next 36 hours. Whines when given proper procedure. Cancelling would cost him over $5000 in cancellation fees.

Update: He went to the store, was told they don't have loaner phones because they don't do repairs. They offered to upgrade the line to get a new phone after the customer paid off the $1000 for the old phone. All 5 lines got cancelled and my cancellation save rate stat has tanked now.",234,0,1
That GPU you installed is faulty come fix it!,"so this happened a few years ago with an old friend of mine, for a bit of backstory a week prior I upgraded my graphics card in my pc and a buddy bought it off me and I installed it since he wasnt very computer literate.

Friend: I did. let me login, \*enters password\* See black screen,

I moved the mouse a bit and the mouse popped up, seemed explorer isn't starting for some reason. I open run and type explorer.exe and sure enough desktop is back.

Friend its fixed! so it was the graphics card, right?

Me: nope, windows being windows and not loading your desktop. so if you would have let me verify the actual issue from home I could have walked you through this from home. So where are we going for food?

I boot into the second one and I am greeted with a BitLocker loop instead of a Windows recovery loop. I go and call $RT for the BitLocker Key.

  
$Me – Hey $RT I am helping $User with his Surface pro. It is stuck in a boot loop and I need the BitLocker recovery key, please.   
$RT – No problem sent you an email   
$Me – I received it any chance the backup software worked for him? (We use a crappy backup software and the user did not save files to the local file server or SharePoint)  
$RT – Does not look like he has any data set up.  
$Me – We have an extra laptop want to set him up with that one and I will see if I can save any data from here?  
$RT - that sounds good.

  
I then spend the next 30 minutes to disable bit locker and run a dskchk scan and as I suspect the SSD took a dump and all sectors are either corrupted, unreachable, or orphans. I inform $RT of the issue and he thanks me for saving him the trouble of mailing the tablet and fighting it. I take my lunch and come back only to realize I forgot my password again… Time to make the call of shame again.

  
$Me – Hey $RT I might need a password reset again…  
$RT – (Laughing at me) Ok I reset it, (in jest) call me when you forget it again  
$ME – Thanks for the reset.

I never thought it would get this bad,"I'm on mobile and this is my first post so forgive me for any spelling errors that autocorrect makes.

Backstory: I'm 18 and have training in tech support, but I'm not certified yet because I can only afford the test once so I want to be really prepared. I just finished highschool so now I have to focus on this. 

So instead of working in an office, I just help my mom and dad whenever they have tech issues. Usually it's my mom and she just can't figure out how split screen. She just got a new computer in March and she was complaining it was running slow. I think it'll be an easy fix so I go check her uptime and it says 16 days. I restarted her computer, and surprise problem solved. 

I show her how to check it and try to explain that she needs to restart it and not just shut it down ( that's still one of things I don't fully understand how it's different but I just tell her to do it). 

But today...today was different. The printer jammed and instead of asking me for help, she managed to un jam it (congrats mom), but then it didn't print. So...she uh decided to uninstall her printer. With no backup. Again, I'm not certified but I was taught to never do that. 

I asked her why she didn't just ask me for help and she replied with ""I went to HP and they said to do it"". She isn't a Karen or entitled or anything like that, she just doesn't always think things through and the quarantine hasn't helped. She didn't restart her computer, she didn't check the driver for an update, she didn't ask me for help, and now I'm somehow wrong for suggesting she should have asked me for help.

From reading other posts on here, I know that this logic is applied to most people that call for tech support. I never thought my mom would one these people and now I'm just going to stay quiet and wait for her to ask for help. 

TLDR: My mom didn't ask for help and her problem got worse.

Update: she just now asked for help

And I was yelled at and sent away. I have had this problem before and I fixed it in about 5 minutes. It's been 13 hours. I won't tell her I've had this issue before so I don't get yelled at that I wasn't helpful even though she did things before asking me. This is my hell.

Update 2: she got it to work 15 hours after her problem started. Now we are back to the split screen problem.",149,0,1
"""Hey, my printer isn't working""","I work for a firm with a lot of different sites. Those sites have their own 'home' network and are not connected to the HQ. So each site has their own subnet with an IP printer on it. A new printer was delivered and I worked remotely with the guy to set up his printer. I was setting up the IPV4 settings, DNS and SMTP, but I couldn't ping the printer, nor could I access the web page.

Janitor is not a techie,"I was an Intern at $Company several years back. $Company is from the local Government. We were a team of about 10 to support about the 500 People in the Company. This includes: Hardware buying, setting up, updating, remote support, phsical (local) support, taking old machines, clearing data of it, **managing the servers**, ...  
So basically were the department, that did everything that required the slightest bit of configuration.  
  
My Internship was in Winter and during the Winter Holidays $Company was closed and everyone at home. Almost no one needed to work and our IT Team was just on call duty. 1 Person each Day (so some people had to work 2 days during that Holiday).

Christmas Eve rolls around and I as an Intern get a call (My first tought: Has the apocalypse started?!).  
&gt; **IT Boss**: Hey we got an issue! We can't reach our Servers! Do you have any idea what might be the issue?  
&gt; **Me**: Not really. Have your tried pinging the Server, SSHing to it through $backupTerminalInCompany (ssh tunnel that has access to internet and intranet), ... (the usual stuff you check)  
&gt; **IT Boss**: Yes and nothing works. We can't even reach the Backup Terminal. And where out of ideas, if you don't have any further Ideas I guess I got to drive to $Company.  
&gt; **Me**: Weird, but I'm actually out of Ideas, Sorry.  
&gt; **IT Boss**: Well it was worth a try. The entire department has been trying for an hour, but didn't reach our servers. Anyways, happy holidays.  
&gt; **Me**: Happy holidays and I hope the fix is an easy one.  
&gt; IT Boss hangs up.  

1 Hour later I get a call from IT Boss telling me what the issue was:  
- Janitor thought: Hey nobody is in company during the Holidays, to conserve energy I can turn off heating.  
- This night is the coldest so far.  
- Server emergency shutdown because ""CPU too cold"".  

I got a good laugh, IT Department got a good laugh and luckily nobody was injured, because as I have found out later: One of the Servers was managing all the traffic lights in $City of $Company. Likely, because the important Traffic Lights have local backup controllers, that run on fixed timers in case connectivity goes down.

For why the backup terminal was unreachable: No IP from the DHCP Server, because that one was also down.

TLDR: Janitor turns off heating in Winter, causes despair in the IT Department, because the Traffic Lights no longer worked properly.",296,0,1

COM: I just need to make you aware of an issue with your site. I created an account a couple days ago and when I log in it says it's Invalid. Now I'm going to do this password reset and change my password AGAIN. This is unexceptable.

Me: I'm sorry that happened. When logging in the first time if the pw is typed in incorrectly when you attempt again, even if the pw is correct, you will still receive the same error. Sometimes you just need to close your browser and reopen it when logging in again. I can reset your pw now and get you in.

COM: No. I'd rather do it myself. This is ridiculous. You have issues with your site and you need to know. **proceeds to rant 

While he's ranting I remember him telling me he received an Invalid user error, meaning his user ID is not in our system. Then he pauses to take a breath and in my sweetest voice with a smile and all....

Me: Sir, is this for yourself or for a facility?

COM: Well of course it's for myself.

A common problem,"Hey guys, long time reader first time poster. I am not in tech support just a general tech nerd who does some misc. tech work around the office. Wanted to give back to the community for all the laughs.

Ok. So this happened a little while ago. I got to the office (we are open with minimum stuff and social distancing etc) and I noticed a few people struggling with a printer. Pretty normal stuff, they usually figure it out or get the actual IT guy for help.

With minimum staff the IT guy was not in. So after a little while I pass by again they ask for help. Turns out that a guy has been trying to print a document for a while now but for some reason the printer just does not work. They tired opening the toner bay, adding a new toner etc.

So we turn the printer on and was going to send a command to start the trouble shooting. The moment the printer was on it started printing. 

The problem was very simple. No body thought to press the power button on the printer as it shut down due to inactivity.",318,0,1
Client manages to spam his own email inbox. Allows tech support to share in this bounty of spam.,"For context, every user profile in the software has a field for their main login email, and another optional field where they can add more email addresses, comma separated, if they want. The optional field is pretty simple in concept - all system notifications going to your main email address will get forwarded to whatever email address you put in the optional field. Unsurprisingly, people get stupid about this.

So, Billy wrote in the other day saying he was getting hundreds of email notifications a day (website registrations, replies from contacts, ect). I took a quick look at his profile, and sure enough, for whatever reason, he has his login email address in that optional field for some reason. Along with the login email of another user on his team's account. Said Other User also had Billy's login email in her optional field on her profile. 

I emailed Billy back explaining, in short, that their bad decisions were causing his, and likely Other User's email accounts to suffer from Sweet Home Alabama syndrome. All they'd need to do was get rid of the email addresses in each other's fields.

Billy emails back saying he, of course, ""tried that and it didn't work"". A quick peek into his profile determined that was a lie. 

That's not all, though. Billy also decided that since I clearly wasn't understanding his issue correctly, he needed to provide some proof through screenshots. I love it when clients do this all on their own. What I didn't expect was an email reply to my ticket with 357 FUCKING ATTACHMENTS. 

So this guy couldn't follow two sentences worth of instructions, but he had time to sit there and download 357 of his spammy emails and send them to me. Cool. 

I explained to him again what he needed to do. Haven't heard back yet. We'll see.

None of the programs are there! I want them back!,"Sometimes you just get those gems of an issue, it makes you want to cry. 

Me: me

User: user

I receive a phone call this morning: me: “Good morning, this is Rhutanium, what can I help you with?”

User: “Yea that new computer you guys brought in to replace the old one doesn’t have any of my programs on. I want that back to the way I had it!”

Me: “Is that the one in the other building? What is it that you’re missing exactly?”

User: “I don’t know. It’s just different. But I can’t work like this, so I need it the way it was.”

Me: “OK. I’m not the one who replaced that particular machine, but I can ask my coworker what he did. I’ll call you back once I know a little more.”

- so what was going on was, in another location on the other side of town (luckily less than 5 mins away) there sits a computer in a warehouse and this user uses it maybe three times a week. The old machine’s power supply had died and it being an old out of warranty machine we just replaced it with a spare we had sitting around. Not sure what my coworker did exactly, but he copied the user’s profile from his regular machine to this one, like we usually do when we roll out a new machine.-

I called the user back:

Me: “So coworker mentions that he copied your profile from your regular machine to this one, so all your icons and everything should be there. Is there an actual program that you’re missing that you’re looking for, or a shortcut that doesn’t work?”

User: “I don’t know man, I just... can you come over here to check this out so you know what to do?”

Me: “....sure. I’ll be right over.” (Mind you, I still had no clue what he was missing)

So I’m over there and go to the machine. I give the once over and everything was there, so I ask him what’s wrong. 

User: “So this doesn’t work. I hit this button here and nothing happens. Can you fix that?”

In one particular piece of software, the numpad minus key wasn’t mapped. Fixed that, and he was happy. 

“None of my programs are on.” Massive facepalm.

Edit: someone questioned our policy of not replacing the psu but the entire machine instead:

We phase older machines out to the work floor (dirty production environment) about 6 months before they run out of their 3 year warranty. So new machine comes into the office, gets rolled out to a user, they use it for 2.5 years, then it gets moved to the work floor where it lives until it dies. Since we have more machines in the office than on the workfloor, we have a healthy supply of spares sitting around. Why would I be messing around with the psu of an old, outdated computer that’s out of warranty if I can replace it with a faster machine that I have simply sitting around. I’m in the business of running a computer network in a reliable fashion and in such a way that my users can comfortably work. If I can give them something faster than what they currently have without having to spend extra money then why the hell wouldn’t I do that?",1144,0,1
"""What baseline file?""","Backstory: I work for a distributor company where we sell CCTV products, but also everything that revolves around IT (servers, cables, switches, routers, etc). A big majority of our customers share the same knowledge as us and most of our calls revolve around product knowledge. Very rarely we get a customer with little to no knowledge about both the product **and** and IT. 

A customer called me today with an intercom set. He told me he had issues with it. 

Me: Tea

Client: Bruh

&gt;  
&gt;**Bruh:** No. How do I do that?

&gt;**Bruh:** Ohh, that! Haha! Totally missed that. Can you send me the firmware versions while you're here?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Tea:** Definitely. Here are two files. First install this one, then this one. The order is important.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bruh:** Gotcha. What's the difference?  
&gt;  
&gt;**Tea:** First one's the baseline firmware, the other one is a language pack. Do not get them mixed up. The language pack will crash the intercom.   
&gt;  
&gt;**Bruh:** Alright, I get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I close the teamviewer, send him a manual to make sure he doesn't lose his way and proceed with my daily tasks. 15 minutes later I receive another call.

&gt;**Tea:** Please do not tell me you installed the language file first?

&gt;  
&gt;**Bruh:** You don't believe me? Here's teamviewer access again.

&amp;#x200B;

I open teamviewer. I open his downloads-folder. I click once on the baseline file (which was still zipped)  to highlight it.

&amp;#x200B;

'The site doesn’t work on the phone.'

this is a website I built and support but it seems to work fine for me.. and now all of a sudden we're getting bug reports from users.. all of them are the same 'It doesn't work'

Which is ideal for debugging.  It doesn't work .. could mean A LOT OF THINGS.  On the phone could mean  A LOT OF THINGS.. android.. ios .. various browsers .. the site is responsive so naturally I go on with my android and try a bunch of stuff .. make an order.. it seems fine I can't figure it out

I email the users.. please tell me what you were doing when 'it didn't work' .. was there an error? What phone are you using.. what browser are you using? I tell the site owner (who has an iphone) please test browse and fake order stuff and see what the issue is.

Meanwhile.. the bulk of the orders are going through fine.. like all kinds of regular activity are humming along... but these few people are bitching.. but number of bitching is increasing!

Finally .. I notice the owner has added a product with $0 that people can buy that gets allocates them to a day for a drive through pickup slot for products (it's a farm) .. but had turned on paypal for that item.. along with check/cash so if some people had selected paypal for $0 dollars and submitted the order to paypal with android/ios 'it wouldn't work' .. as they never scrolled down to the return page  with $0 order

anyway .. fuck .. so now I fixed her $0 product never to show paypal as a method... but FFS .. why can't a user give a good bug report????

rant off :)

Cunninham's server specs,"""the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer.""

A project manager asked for a new server, but only gave the CPU and RAM requirements, along with that it needed to be a physical server.

After reaching out to them for days regarding the drive sizes, and other requirements, I still had no response. I got the director involved and he gave some clues as to what this was about. He got me the end users and I was able to contact them directly.

Of course, being end users, and not the ones working with the vendor, they barely knew what they wanted. But I made a best guess as to the other server specs and sent the request off for a quote.

Only then does the PM respond with a list of corrections about what the server actually needs.

Bonus:
&gt;PM: If we're going to reuse the PCIe card from the current server, make sure it fits in the new server.

tl;dr- I'm working at Large Client (LC) trying to clean up after a security audit that showed significant issues. One of the largest obstacles is LC itself.
    
  
I'm stuck with Ian again. He's the lead engineer on the Vault, which does blockchain things and is all things to all people.   
  
At least according to the brochure.  
  
    INVENTORY  
  
Lawtechie has:  
  
An empty laptop bag  
An impending sense of doom  
  
    S  
  
Lawtechie is back in the Equipment Dispensary. There are fewer bored LC employees here. The short woman who has seen things is also not there.  
  
    WAIT
  
Nothing happens.  
  
I give up and make my way to my cubicle.  
  
There's an intro mail from Aarush. He'd like me to meet the team tomorrow. In the meantime, he sends me a few links to more details of the Vault.  I accept.  
  
The details aren't that detailed. I do find an infomerical video explaining how The Vault will fix everything, given by Aarush.  
  
I also notice that none of the source code is in the regular reposititories. I email Ian and Aarush. The answer from Aarush is not satisfying. I get a paragraph almost instantly:  
  
&gt; Due to the sensitivity of this project, all development is done solely on the engineers' own laptops. If you need to see the code, Ian can walk you through it.   
  
Oh dear. A code review narrated by Ian is going to be awful.  
  
I consider replying with ""I wanted a thing to do that _didn't_ require me to interact with Ian. If you'll sign my timecard, I'll detail your car"",but I know better.  
  
I get distracted by my LC chat pinging to get my attention.  
  
Betty:""I need clarification on audit finding seven- Inaccurate system inventory""  
  
And a link to an audit report.   
  
The one I'm not supposed to have. Betty is my savior. Or she didn't know I'm not supposed to see it. Either way, I'm going to solve her problem as best I can to thank her.  
  
A quick search reveals a dry finding:""Some systems are not reflected correctly in the current inventory"". It reads like the auditor was calling out an inconsequential thing like using the same labels for systems kept for parts and systems that could be repaired and put back into service.   
  
Or it's a very dry way to say ""ten percent of our entire fleet is unfindable and unaccounted for"".  
  
I respond to Betty.  
  
LawTechie:""Thanks for the link. To close this finding, show me your inventory list and I'll take a look.""  
  
Betty:...  
  
Betty:...    
  
Betty:""It's the same inventory list""  
  
me:""Well, how can we prove that the inventory list is accurate?""  
  
Betty:""It's complicated. I'll get you an invite to the Slack channel. You can ask there""  
  
me:""What?""  
  
Betty:""There's a Slack channel to keep track of systems""  
  
For a second I consider how one would go about spinning up VMs from slack.   
  
    /server create --flavor 200 --image 655321 --key-name prodkey --security-group fn0rd Server001  
  
and then possibly a macro to assign a relevant meme based on the outcome.  
  
I think I've misunderstood what's going on.  
  
It's time to meet Aarush and Ian. Aarush's conference room is in a wing that is slicker than I'd expect for LC- exposed brick, reclaimed wood. This must be where the cool kids work.  
  
Aarush is a tall, thin man who speaks quickly and to control the channel. I ask for an overview and get the same infomercial pitch. The Vault can be used for transactions of all types, file storage and can make its users more attractive.   
  
Aarush shows me a transaction handled by the Vault- seeing the item, placing the order and handling the transaction. For $172.92, I'm getting a smaller generic monitor. Great.  
  
Any more detailed question results in either:  
  
""You should look at the code to understand""  
  
""This is proprietary private blockchain""  
  
""It definitely meets that requirement better than any existing solution""  
  
I find I'm asking him questions to keep him talking. My consciousness is drifting away from this conversation. I'm imagining that I'm running in a circular maze and I'm only spending time.  
  
Then it comes to me- Aarush's answers are always positive. If I ask if it does something good, it does. If I ask if it does something bad, it doesn't.   
  
me:""The Vault stores all transaction data permanently, right?""  
  
Aarush:""Of course""  
  
me:""But you told me you weren't storing credit card numbers""  
  
Aarush:""Well, no. We're not storing those""  
  
I'm back on the circle. Luckily, Aarush has to take a personal call.   
  
He leaves his laptop unattended. Ian's been ignoring us both.  
  
I grab Aarush's laptop and look at the demo transaction. Out of curiosity, I add a second monitor and change the shipping information to Weisbaden, in Hesse, Germany.  
  
The price changes to €172.92.  
  
Huh.   
  
I add three more units. The whole lot is a bargain at €172.92.   
  
I have a feeling I'm being had here. I take a quick picture, get up, push Aarush's laptop back to where it was and walk over to Ian.  
  
Ian's customizing some kind of tacticool attachment he's ordering from a gun fetish site. I kick the back of his chair.  
  
me:""Hey, can you walk me through how this code works?""  
  
Ian looks at me with an expression I don't recognize- fear. I reflect on the grad student interviewing sociopaths: [""That's what they look like before I stab them""](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/when-your-child-is-a-psychopath/524502/).  
  
I'm puzzled. Why is he scared?  I can't actually pay attention to what Ian says, only because it'll be too confusing. I'll just keep him talking.  
  
Ian:""Hey. Why do you need to see the code? It's locked down.""
  
me:""Uhh, to get an overview- to understand how it all works behind the scenes, since there's no documentation""
  
Why is he afraid? Is there something really wrong with what they've put together?   
  
me:""Uh, huh.""  
  
I think the Vault is vaporware, but I can't prove it yet. Ian isn't going to share with me unless he's forced.   
  
My phone buzzes with an email from Betty that explains why keeping track of systems is hard:  
  
1. One team has the capability to create new VMs at LC, the Server team. They approve requests via ticket, with a turnaround of two to three weeks if they do.   
  
2. Since getting a VM is such a pain, nobody relinquishes them when they do get them.   
  
3. This Slack is for talking shit about LC and trading VMs for favors. It's a wretched hive full of scum and villany.   
  
And I'm going to figure out who owns what and keep track. This seems to be an ideal use of a private cloud blockchain.  
  
To be continued...",1748,0,1
What is going on here?,"So this happened a few hours ago. I was taking a call from a lady who was having issues connecting to the company’s VPN. 

Me: this is the IT service desk

Lady: Hi I’m having trouble connecting to the VPN. It’s not accepting my password. 

Me: ok I’ll check on that and see why it’s not accepting your password

It was at time that we suddenly got flooded with calls from people. I thought that maybe something had just broken. I also usually mute my phone so I don’t have to talk to them while I’m working but this time I forgot to. 

Me: what is going on here?!!

I was slightly freaked out at the time about seeing our lines being flooded. The lady on the phone heard me. 

Lady: I have no idea! That’s why I called you!

I had to explain to the lady that I was looking at an unrelated issue. It was an awkward moment.",1153,0,1
2 hour helpdesk calls and you,"I promise there's not a word of lie here other than my usual dramatic writing style.

Had a 2 hour call this morning (around 7:20-9:30AM) because we sent most of our cube jockeys home and while we provided what laptops we had to users most people are using their home machines. This puts the helpdesk in a position where we have to support people's \*shudder\* personal machines.

This laptop was old. Like, Methuselah if measured in computer years old. Core 2 Duo, 4GB of RAM, Windows 7, and didn't look to have been reimaged since 2009-ish just to go by  the software install and  file modified dates. Now, anyone who checks into my post history knows I am a retro computing fanboy. I reburbed an Amiga 600 and a Tandy 1000 just this year. But let's be clear, 11 years old is too old for daily use unless you work for the IRS.

Her reported issue was that Citrix was connecting, then closing abruptly. Sounded like something was timing out. Mostly blaming her ancient system and likely usage habits I fired up our semi trusty remote access tool and was amazed when  it successfully connected - after four minutes.

Compounding the issue was the fact that this woman was a hoarder. Not of newspapers, knickknacks or medical prostheses, but of software. She claimed she still needed H&amp;R Block tax software from 2009. She was now on Comcast but insisted that she needed her old Verizon In-Home Advisor (known adware and resource hog, I removed it surreptitiously while she was yelling at her dogs).

Final tally of issues: 5 browser toolbars, 3 different security suites running AT THE SAME TIME, numerous ""coupon"" apps, desktop completely overrun with icons (moved a screenful into a folder, hit arrange, another full screen - 5 times), 170GB of photos I had to offload to make enough room to update Citrix from version 4.6, a 150GB Norton 360 BACKUP - ON THE SAME DRIVE - of said photos, etc.

To be fair, after 11 years of use by what could be generously be called a novice is blunt testament to how solid Windows 7 was. It's genuinely impressive that it ran as well as it did, which is to say it was running at all.

Aftercare included a quick rundown on why coupon apps are always - without exception - adware, how you only need one security suite, backing up  isn't very useful if you put it on the same device, and that the IRS can't really come after you after 3 years unless you're rich or a corporation. Recommended a decent cheap laptop if she chose to upgrade as well, and instructed her to contact her boss to request a work laptop as well since she wouldn't have admin on that one.

Highlights include having to mute myself in order to answer nature's call since she refused to let me work unsupervised, dogs constantly barking in the background, and constantly having to explain what I was doing because this was her laptop so she had to know what was happening to it. I don't have an issue with  keeping an eye on the guy working on your machine, but this lady didn't know the difference between deleting an icon and uninstalling a program.

Took a longer break than usual after that, total brain fry for about 20 minutes before I could successfully rub two neurons together.",326,0,1
The Human Machine,"The recent story about Phat Al made me remember a funny name story from my own workplace, a couple of years ago.

I was told the story by my colleague over a few beers, so there is some creative freedom in it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, my colleague works in our network department, and at this point was fairly newly transferred from our 1st line operations into the network team, meaning he was the ""newbie"", tasked with all the minor issues as learning experiences.

One day, he noticed something weird in our network logs, a reference to a fax machine kept popping up. We haven't even had physical phone lines for at least 5 years at this point (we all use cell-phones under a common business subscription), let alone any fax lines.

So, he started digging through the logs, tracing the traffic, finally pinpointing it to a specific switch, serving a specific office area.

He heads down there, looking around, but can't find anything resembling a fax machine.

Finally he asks the people working in that area if they ""know about a fax here?"", the answer? ""Yeah, *HE* is sitting right over there"".

Turns out, it was a relatively new user, who's initials spelled out ""f.a.k.s"" (the local word for fax), and he'd gotten that as his company username.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Network technician searches for a fax machine, finds a human fax",327,0,1

Phat Al and friends,"This is from the early 80s, two really short stories from the days of Digital VAX/VMS systems.

First, we had a support call from a user asking who Phat Al was and why did he keep saying 'error' (he was a Texan working in Australia).  

What the?  After some discussion we eventually decoded what he was talking about ... he was referring to a FAT-AL (FATAL) error message on his terminal. 

Facepalm!

\---

Secondly, another user was complaining that his program was taking too long to run.  In fact it took around 24 hours to process a stack of data crunching in Fortran. 

So after working with the user we did some work on his code, and managed to get the runtime down to around 12 hours.  Pretty good work!  

But he was still unhappy. 

We thought about his problem, and were considering coding keys parts in assembler (Macro-32), but thought we needed to discuss his problem in more detail, after all we have already doubled his performance.

It turns out that he just wanted to be able to use his terminal for other work and not wait for the processing to complete.  How long it took was not important.  So showing him how to created a DCL script, and the SUBMIT command solved the problem, even better we could run this computation at a low CPU priority which was a bonus!

Moral of the story... really understand your users needs (requirements) before doing anything!",268,0,1
Customer pays $1049 for a $49 screen repair.,"We had a customer come in for a screen repair for an iphone 6s plus. We typically charge $49.99 before tax to repair this. The customer was kind of annoyed and generally abrasive becuase we have pandemic procedures in place right now due to covid-19.Our pandemic procedures involves having 1 person in 1 person out and keeping the door locked between customers and the door has 3 signs up telling any customers to please take a ticket from the ticket dispenser and wait in their car for someone to come out with the sign to display the next number to be served.

About 90% of our customers ignore these signs and somehow even avoid looking at the signs even if they are right in front of them and instead go right to pulling on the locked door, get annoyed, and start knocking on the door, even if they had already managed to pull a ticket. This was one such customer.

But the real problem didnt come before the repair it came after. The customer, still passively agressive towards our service rep picks up their device and waits in their car for about an hour. Our customer service rep, understandably curious as to if the customer has a problem. goes out there and sees if the customer needed anything else. to which the customer, without explanation, yelled at our Service rep to go away and in not so many words to ""- off"". The customer immediately started pulling out at this point and their bumper began falling off. Our customer service rep, by their account of the event, just watched as they pulled away with a bumper becoming further and further detached from their vehicle by the second wondering if they were going to stop and fix it. The customer never stoped to maintain the bumper and actually let the bumper come off and fall in the entrance to the parking lot and then proceeded to drive off without attempting to retrive their now fully detached bumper.

I, remembering that they had a front-mounted License plate on their bumper, decided to take a picture of the abandoned bumper and bring it in to our store and call the non-emergency police line for our city to report a freshly abandoned bumper on the road.

My shift ended and I had left before the police arrived as they were busy trying to prevent rioting in our city that actually had happened on the same street as my job location. But from what my co-worker told me, the cop that arrived said that if it was just simple debris it would have only be a $50 fine and possibly a month in jail. But because they had actively neglected a significant part of their vehicle on the road, there were additional charges such as reckless operation of a vehicle and neglect of responsibility to a major road hazard as the abandoned bumper could pose a threat to another vehicle that tacked on roughly another $950",2627,0,1
Classic Pebcak,"After reading some of these, I created an account just to post this one.

&amp;#x200B;

I work for an organization where at that time I occupied a help desk position and was acting as the team Coordinator/Supervisor. I was in a leadership team meeting consisting of fellow IT team Coordinators where near the end of the meeting, our Geographical Mapping Systems Coordinator brought up a complaint from one of her team members and advised that she found her team members experience to reflect poorly on our Help Desk; she asked me to follow up on the support her team member had been given.

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally I ask for specific details, like what problems is she having, how many tickets are we talking here, does she have a list of ticket numbers for these continual issues? Of course, she had no idea and no job numbers, just that her team member had expressed much frustration with IT support. She asked that after I follow up on this I report back to her with how I've resolved her team members problem and how I can implement some strategies so as these problems don't affect our wider staff. I'll note that she was not rude and this was just normal leadership team speak I am familiar with, she was just sure of the fact that it's the help desk's problem; this was also asked of me in-front of the other Coordinators and our Manager, I found this great as it now ropes them into this story and I'm always confident that it's never our Help Desk at fault in these circumstances.

&amp;#x200B;

Some further back story, we had recently gone through a laptop refresh/roll-out of new hardware, we use SCCM/MECM (maybe SCM back then) for user software deployments which has a software centre application where users can select and install their software. Staff were issued a print out with their new machines, detailing how to access this software centre, it had pretty pictures, including the Windows 7 all programs menu that pointed to the link, staff were also emailed this document and it was available on our intranet website.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I go and search our ticket system for all requests logged from this user and I find two jobs, one closed days prior. The closed job was in the line of ""user advised missing application X, directed to software centre to install it"". The open job was an incident logged the afternoon before, where she was complaining that she is missing all of her applications including MS Office and she is unable to perform her role; she was on someone else's machine, under their logon, as a workaround (this is also a no no).

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know this one's going to be great as Office is part of the OS build, it can't not be there and I've already an idea of what's going on and I'm sure you reading also share this; I call the user, who was quite frustrated and voiced her complaint to me that she is unable to perform her role and this whole roll-out has caused her significant delays.

&amp;#x200B;

I go and see the user...... She proceeds to start up her machine, log in and go ""see"" then look at me; I'm holding back a smile here as my suspicions are further reinforced . I play along and say sorry, i'm not seeing any issue; she just gives me this look like am I stupid or something and then lets out this sigh and says ""I don't have any applications.."" in this condescending tone. I continue to play as this is just freaking great, I'm a bundle of joy right now and I'm containing my excitement, I continue to be stoic and ask her what applications is she missing... again, the look, she says well everything (in a 'duh' tone) except that application X I had the help desk install for me, like, where's my email and word!

&amp;#x200B;

I ask to grab her mouse, I then proceed to show her the start - all programs menu where Office and everything else she's supposedly missing is right there; she looks dumbfounded, just dumbfounded, then a comeback sparks in her pea brain and she gets all snoody and asks why aren't they on her computer! I say, your desktop? I then show her how to create a shortcut and again, she's dumbfounded; now shit, she still has this attitude like it's IT at fault and states, well why were they not there in the first place! I explain that many users don't want their desktop cluttered and in-fact, we purposely do not create shortcuts as part of deployments for this reason, it's just basic computer skills for staff to create their own shortcuts. I also went and pointed out the software centre printout, the email and the intranet article detailing how to re-install her software, I made a point of drawing out the conversation explaining what a shortcut is, where it points to (C:\\program files etc); She gave no quarter, she just makes some half-asred sigh type noises and accepts it, but both her and I know that she just realized she was being stupid and rude. I then rubbed further salt into the wound by saying her using another users machine while under that other users logon is in breach of the organizations security and privacy policies as noted during employee induction; that one broke home, I could see she had accepted defeat.

&amp;#x200B;

I finish this all up with a management style email (as she requested) to the Coordinator and with a CC to everyone in that meeting detailing exactly the problem; that we had exactly two jobs logged by the user, that she failed to check the three sources of documentation for her software installs, and that it was a lack of elementary user computer skills where I had provided coaching in how to create a desktop shortcut; furthermore, her using another users machine was in-breach of organizational security and privacy policies. My 'strategy' for moving forward was that the user required some basic computer training courses and requires to respect organizational policy. I also went and had a personal conversation with her Coordinator, who did apologizes, but I discussed how I found it amazing that this High School and University graduate had come to never understand how to or require to create a shortcut or use the 'all programs' menu, I mean this user operates mapping system applications! I didn't ask, but i suspect she was primarily a Mac user. In the following days each of the Coordinators and Manager came to me and advised it was a great laugh. So yeah, classic pebkac.",141,0,1
"Oops, check it now.","Hello TFTS, Quick one for you:

Long ago at my first job as a consultant, I was around 22 years old at the time. We had a client that I was doing some cabling for.

I don’t remember how I did it (Long ago) but I somehow bumped a cable for one of the AP’s going from the switch to the patch panel.

&amp;#x200B;

I was in the network closet finishing up. When my mentor of a manager, messaged me.

Manager: Hey, can you find out what’s going on with the AP on port 3. It is showing offline.

(Looking at the switch, and the cable going to the patch panel,  I realized that the cable was not seated properly.)

Manager:  Have you gotten to the AP location yet? That better not be the same f'n AP that I had to deal with the other day.

Me: Check it now.

Manager: It’s back up, why was it down?

Me: I’m in the network closet, and I bumped the patch panel cable…

Manager: Ah, i see. DON'T DO THAT!

Me: Sorry, geez…

&amp;#x200B;

I got along with him very well, I knew he was just giving me a hard time, for making a rookie screw-up.",234,0,1
Printer remote diagnostic WIN,"I am one of those demon tamers you all know and love, a printer tech. On this day, I'm covering another tech's area as well as my own. I have one call 2 hours away in one direction, another 4 hours in another (other tech's area), and a few local calls, all of which are supposed to be done by end of day. My Delorean is currently in the shop (Mr. Fusion problems - how can it be out of warranty when it hasn't been invented yet?), and Scotty still hasn't fixed the transporter. Constrained by the normal laws of time and space, it just can't be done. The 2 hour call is definitely a hardware issue, but the 4 hour one is for a tray lifting error. Hmmm.

So, I call the customer. First thing I ask them to do is check the paper in the tray is not jamming the lift mechanism - nope. Tray is set to the right size, stop isn't broken, etc. Turn the printer off and back on, no change. I have them open and close the tray and watch the paper level indicator on the front, it never moves. So, out of easy things to check, I resign myself to a missed deadline and a long drive tomorrow - WAIT! I have the user take out the toner cartridge - sure enough, someone had changed the toner, and not pulled out the shipping strip!

For some reason, on some printers this causes weird things to happen - trays not to lift, print jobs to hang, etc, instead of showing an appropriate error message. It's something I've only seen a couple times in 5 years doing this, and it made me SO happy to have pulled it out at the right time.",562,0,1
"""Can I have my cat photo back on my desktop please?""","I just randomly thought about this story and decided to post it here. Long time lurker, first time poster.

This happened about a year ago when I worked at a small non-profit health clinic as a help desk technician. My company had recently brought in a MSP to help upgrade the IT infrastructure at the clinic (I would say that they did s---to improve but that's another story). ""Fun"" thing about this MSP, is that they never tell me or the rest of the in-house help desk team when they were going to push out major updates, where when Monday comes around we get a flood of calls or tickets in the morning about something that was changed or had broken because of said update and not knowing how to fix it because we weren't informed until later in the afternoon. 

One of the changes that they made, albeit minor, was that they changed the desktop  background from the regular Windows logo to an all light blue background with their logo, help desk number, and computer name at the bottom right of the screen. Truthfully not many people mind it, plus it made it easier for the user to give us the computer name whenever they called, but we did get calls from one or two from managers that had already had a background photo saved as their wallpaper. In comes the director of the behavioral health department. 

Now the BH director was a nice old woman, but was also computer illiterate. I never had no problem with her since she was always patient and didn't throw a fuse when we couldn't fix something right away. She did though had a wallpaper of her cat that she loved so much on her desktop. My other co-workers that have been there longer already know of the cat and said she would on and on about it. 

Come Monday when the update was pushed out and I get a call from director saying that her cat photo ""disappear"". Can't remember the conversation per Baum, but it went something like this:

Me: Me      BH: BH Director

Me: ""IT neb93 speaking""

BH: Hi, this is the director. I logged in to my computer this morning and I can't find my cat photo on the desktop. Can you help me find it?

Me: Sure, give me one moment

BH: Thank you

I remoted into her computer and low and behold, I see the light blue wallpaper on the screen. She showed the picture of her cat in her photos folder, right click on the photo, set it as desktop background, went back to the desktop screen and no luck. Tried some other stuff and still no luck. I was the only in the tech in the office (we did help desk and onsite work) so I didn't know what to do. 

Me: Hello, director? Let get in contact with our MSP and see they did over the weekend and I will call you back.

BH: Ok, thank you. I really want my cat photo back

Me: I'll see what I can do

I got in contact with the MSP through slack and told them the situation, and just as I thought, the virtual CIO said that this was part of group policy and cannot be changed. So I called the BH director and told her the bad news. 

BH: So there no way for you to get my cat photo back?

Me: I'm sorry but no. This is a part of our new policy now and I cannot change it

BH: Oh ok then. \*I sense a little sadness in her voice\* Thank you trying anyway

Me: No problem, sorry I couldn't help you out further

We ended the call there and I went about my day. I thought that was the end of it until she called every  few days for the next two weeks with the same question, and me and the other two techs told her the same thing. It became a regular thing where my team started to joke about it a bit, ""the case of the missing cat photo"". Even the virtual CIO and the MSP started to get on to the joke. 

The BH director never brought it up again after that until two-three months before she retired. Other than that, when it was her last day, our virtual CIO made a remark. 

""I guess we weren't able to find her cat photos after all""

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr Group Policy update was pushed out to standardize the desktop background screen, BH director called wanting the background of her cat back on her desktop, kept calling for the next two weeks thinking our answer was going to change.",1218,0,1
"""what's mine is mine"" but isn't.","The cat picture post (title) reminded me of a case when I was a handyman/IT support for a small company;

This was a few years ago (2015/16), we'd had a run of issues where the ageing fleet of enterprise desktops (win xp) were starting to fall over with updates.

Company issues notice to all employees that we've been having problems and that any important data must be backed into the server and/or another suitable device, and stressed that the server should not be used to store personal information or 'private/personal' files.

Few weeks later there was another casualty and the user demanded (fairly impolitely, like shouting at the top of her voice, impolitely) that the machine be replaced right away because they had important work to be getting on with.

Drop everything. Replace the computer. Get her up to speed on the new machine. All the while being regaled about how this sort of thing shouldn't be happening, and if we were doing our jobs... you get the picture.

A number of days later, the same user shrieks at the top of her lungs then starts blubbering incoherently and wailing at the top of her voice. That got our attention. Then the chair turns around and a face of pure murderous intent shrieks ""what did you do!? You deleted them didn't you!""

The fu...?

Turned out she had family photos stored locally on her work computer with absolutely no backup anywhere on this earth.

You felt sorry for her; losing something so apparently important, but then also you didn't because if they were that important having only one copy on a computer that doesn't belong to you. 

Particularly when that person reminds you of the company policy to physically destroy the hard drive ""to ensure the company data can't be stolen"" and adds the ""see if you can at least get that right"".

Particularly when after that person derides and berates a junior operator for not saving work regularly enough and losing about 20 minutes of test data (which we could easily recover) to the point the girl was in tears and shaking (she didn't show up again after that) then circulates the email reminding people to back key data up and that personal files shouldn't be stored on company computers.

But that wasn't a company computer (it was) that was *their* computer.",588,0,1
The printer that wont print on the sides,"I am not a tech support guy, I am just *that kid* that parents and all their friends rely on to show them the basics and solve whatever issue they get. Do I know how to solve those issues? Usually no, but through trial and error all things can be solved.

Its sometime early 2020 and I get a call. Moms friend, nice guy, drops me some coins for my troubles so I don't have complaints. Apparently his printer will not print on sides of the page, cuts off two centimeters on both sides while he needs an entire page.  Months ago he had that issue before and it was simply wrong printing settings.  So I expected it to be 1.go there 2.set page margins to 0. 3.done, in and out 20 minute adventure. 
After I arrived there he demonstrated the issue, he printed a PDF file using adobes reader and of course two centimeters on both sides are blank, the text is cut off. 
So I do my thing and set page margins to zero. Aaaaaand... The issue is solv..
No it still wont print on the sides. 
Great... What else can I try? Maybe its adobe readers fault. I'll just use firefox to print this out and it will be good.
Nope, still no good.
Ok I got nothing, lets google for it. He made a comment on me googling for solutions
&gt;Why are you looking for help? Your own brain is incapable of solving this?

*derp* Well thats a bruh moment, eh, he doesnt mean it. Its fine.
So internet pages say 1. check the program (tried that). 2. check the drivers. So lets get some drivers (OS is windows vista (in 2020)..*sigh*)
By now I am also helping with his phone, but thats a boring story (migrating data from android 2.0 that somehow survived a decade to modern xiaomi device), just being more distracted from figuring out the printer.
I find the proper driver, install it and print the test page.
The test page comes without the sides as well. 
Ok thats it, it must be mechanical failure. Time to open up the printer and look inside. Its cartridge must be jammed or something. I suggest to the man that we should open it up, check for faults and clean it. Maybe its cartridge is stuck on something. 
He was skeptical.
&gt;I changed the cartridge myself a month ago. It is all fine and clean inside. And the cartridge is still full.

I am also doubting myself, after all this is a laser printer. I had inkjets jam up and fail to reach sides of the page, but laser printers don't move that way, there is no reason for it not to reach sides of the page.
Still, I am out of options, I tried everything I can think of on the software side by then. I press on.
&lt;Hey lets just open it up, maybe if we pull out the cartridge and put it back in it will clear whatever jam it picked up.

He submits and opens up his printer, pulls out packaging foam, pulls out the cartridge, blows some air into it to clean the dust off. Inserts the cartridge back into the printer, puts the white packaging foam back inside, closes the printer. Runs a print and edges still fail to print. 
...
HOL UP! Why is there packaging foam inside the printer, why did you put packaging foam inside the printer??? Pull that stuff out!
**Printer starts working normally**
AWWWHHHHH YESSHHHHH FINALLYYY
&gt;So we could have just done this and none of this software stuff?

&lt;Well turns out the issue was not in software this time. Why did you put packaging foam inside printer?

&gt;It came with those already inside. How do you know if its not part of the printer?

&lt;hm.. yes how do I know? its all so complex inside with so many pieces that do god knows what. Well never-mind that, now you'll know these cubes of packaging foam are not part of the printer.

Soon after I figured out how to copy phone numbers from android 2.0 to Xiaomi's android 9 system (while juggling other issues like no wifi and lost cables), arrange music just how he liked it and it was time to leave.
As I walked home my mind wandered...
How do we know what is and what is not part of the printer? Is it the contrast between white foam and black plastic? Is it the texture? Perhaps the softness of the material?
How exactly I managed to clear a printer jam by setting print margins to zero months ago?  Or maybe the foam came with the cartridge and was placed inside with the new cartridge? Did the printer print for a month without an issue while jammed or were the cubes inserted later and he failed to make the connection?
And how is that android 2.0 phone still alive?",494,0,1
Plug it in...or nit.,"LTL, FTP, on mobile.

Ok, so this just happened.  Some quick background, I live with my wife and mother in law and serve as the tech support for the family.  Yesterday afternoon, the power was very unstable, probably because of the aircons running for the first time in the neighborhood.  So, your friendly tech unplugged the computers to protect them before spending the next ten minutes getting enough power scrapped together between all the brief blackouts downing the apartment building to melt some cheese on his brunch bagel bullseye.

Well, once brunch was over, power was stable again, so fast forward a few hours, and the computer was plugged back in before retiring for the evening.

This morning, an hour or two before I was planning to wake up, in comes mother in law, rousing us both to plug her computer back in.  *slow blinks, confused, not awake yet*

I shambled sleepily into the living room, sans glasses, and pressed the unlit power button on the side of the tower.

&gt; Let there be Computing!

Going back to sleep now.  Good nap to you all!

Why update?????,"Set my father up a dead simple Linux box when I was off in college. Link to connect to the dialup, link to the web browser, link to pidgin for chat. That's it.  Every time I came home I'd update, and that was it. 6 years, no support issues.

Well, at some point there was a flash update and videos started not working on the old version. Ok, I'll remotely walk him through running updates, it's a 10 hour drive home. I try for a bit to walk him through the point and click interface, but it's painful because he can't ever find any button ever. So in a stroke of brilliance, I decide to just have him do it command line, since all you have to do is press F12 for a terminal, then type ""sudo yum update"" then your password. Then ""Y"" to confirm. Nice and unambiguous.

An hour and a half later of the most painful troubleshooting I've ever done trying EVERYTHING and wondering why TF this simple thing is failing every time, he asks ""wait, do you mean like just the letter 'Y'?""  Yes, at the prompt ""Apply updates? (Y/N)"" he'd been typing ""why?"" every time. I would never have believed someone could be that stupid about anything.

"""But what if i loose the picture in the wall?""","So my story took place about 2 years ago in an international company in Austria. About 2,500 people are working there and our 2nd level IT support team was about 10 people big.

One time I got an emergency call from one of our presentation rooms with beamers and screen wall etc. The people there had a presentation with other employees from many different countries who came to austria for this meeting. 

When I entered the room a woman waited already for me, obviously stressed and when I asked what the problem is, she told me she cannot get the picture from the laptop to the big screen on the wall. You could see the windows screensaver there but not the presentation. So I already knew what was wrong, she just had to take the window and drag it to the other screen.

I explained and showed her, how this is working with any two or more screens. I took the window and dragged it out of the picture on the laptop to the other screen.

Her eyes got big like I was doing magic and her only question was: ""but what if I accidentally drop the picture somewhere in the wall, and I cannot find it anymore?""

I had to be polite and could not just burst into laughing, some of the other people in the room actually did that for me. But back in the IT office I had to share the story and we all had a good laugh 😂😅",443,0,1
No QA or even sanity test before roll out- what do you think happened?,"Work as a snr PM for a big retail company, at the time I was consulting and took the month of December off. 

Now the company I work for is huge, and they have a pharmacy division which is where this takes place. The company in house built an rx app, at the time it was still in its infancy phase and been rolled out to about 170 locations. 

The db conversion from the old application does not carry everything over to the new app, this required the user to launch old app as a read only in order to reference information. 

Business engaged IT for a project to role out widescreen monitors to be installed as dual screen. I get a call from my manager telling me go look into it ASAP as the business is losing their shit and the pm is botching the project.

At this point all I know is the pm is messing up a monitor install. So I call him up, what's the scope? 

Pm: just install a second monitor in xx amount of stores

Me: why? That's not our standard (at this point I wasn't too familiar with this pharmacy app)

Pm: I dont know...

I have the parts picked, i go to the lab, and call up the vendor installing it. 

Me: vendor what's your onsite scope?

Vendor: Install second monitor using the hdmi cable.

Alright cool, let me mimic.

I do the install, not working exactly as the business explained. Device manager&gt;video card oh wow this card is disabled as part of the base image. Cool that explains why nothing happens when u plug in.

I Call the business lead, why do u need another monitor
She explains...

Ok so here's your problem, as of now the app can only run in 4:3 ratio if you launch on the new monitor some buttons dont show up (I tested)

I suggested to her to use windows + arrow key to snap the app to the side and snap old app to the otherside. It's not what she wanted and doesnt look so great (some cut off) but it works for what she needed.

Call up PM...

Me: did you seriously not do even a sanity test or a POC? I had to ruin my vacation because you cannot even run a monitor project????? (My team does massive infrastructure related projects, so to mess up installing a monitor is ridiculous)

PM: it's not my job to test, or coordinate these activities.  I just buy the hw and engage vendor to install.....

K now I am done with this conversation,  it is literally the job of the PM to engage the right people and follow processes. spoke to director who engaged me... he fired the guy in the new year.

Tl:dr IT project manager couldnt do the most simplistic tasks, pulled me from vacation to resolve it. He was terminated not long after

Missing building is not an issue?,"I've been lurking for a while but thought i might share this. This is a story from way back in my early days of techsupport that i thought might fit here. Kind of a long one but one i think anyone who's ever worked in a service profession can appreciate. Mandatory disclaimer: English is not my first language so please overlook the spelling/grammar errors.

First a bit of back story: I started my career in IT as a support tech for a national ISP in my country. The whole setup was a bit odd as i wasn't employed by the ISP, but by a third party hired by the ISP (imagine your everyday call center). This is not uncommon, but what was is the fact that my company actually belonged to a competing conglomerate. The story behind this was that back when the ISP was it's own entity they had hired my company, and when the ISP later got bought we had been doing such a good job that they decided to keep us on, even if that meant paying their competition. The ISP actually had their own in-house support as well, but we were just better at it so we were kept on anyways.

This meant that while we ""technically"" were outsiders, we ended up having a lot more access than we should have had since all the people the ISP employed themselfs usually had to come to us for help even though we were the hired help(and treated as such). It was all a bit backwards.

On to the actual story. After having worked there for a couple of years i was fairly savvy in the ways of techsupport and i had finagled my way into a lot of system access i technically shouldn't have had. One day i get a call from a lady (L).

Me: Welcome to tech-support, this is OP, how can i help you?  
L: MY INTERNET IS NOT WORKING!! (Literally screaming in my ear). By pure instinct i actually reacted by throwing my headphones of my head because my ears felt like they had been stabbed. I had to take a moment, shook my head and put them back on while holding the earpice away from my ear. The lady was still ranting at the top of her lungs. Now at this point i had been yelled at plenty and was kinda jaded so i just dove right back in.  
Me interrupting her: I'm sorry to hear that, but before i can help you i need your name and adress or customer id so i can look up your connection.

She calmed down a bit (just a bit mind you. I think she was shocked that i interrupted her epic rant). After the usual looking up the customer in the systems, checking her connection and history and such i conclude that yes, her connection was indeed down. This was a bit odd since she had a 100Mbit fiber optic connection, which meant that at the very least i should always be able to see her fiber optic converter connected. I didn't.

L: So! Is it fixed! (a whole 3 minutes after giving me her info)  
Me: Not yet ma'am, i'm looking inte the issue as we speak.  
L: Well fix it already!! I'm not paying for this crap if it's not working! (Back to screaming)

This is when i noticed that it wasn't just her connection. It was her whole building. Looking further into it i found it was actually the whole neighborhood of 12+ apartement complexes with hundreds of customers that was down. I get suspicious .

Me: Ma'am, do you know if there is a power outage in your area?  
L: No there isn't everything else is FINE! It's just your crappy internet that isn't working!  
Me: Ok, because from what i can see your whole neighborhood is down. Do you know if there is any construction or digging going on in the area?  
L: What does that have to do with it!?  
Me: If there is, i suspect they might accidentaly have cut the area connection. It happens sometimes when there is digging going on.  
L: Well there isn't. My building is fine! I found that wording a bit odd, so i keep going.  
Me: Ok. Do you happen to know if there is anything happening elsewhere in the area?  
L: They're building across the street, but that irrelevant. I don't care about that building.

This is when i look up her adress on the maps and come to a realization. Thanks to my access i had earlier in the day been reading some of our third line support-cases (just for giggles. The third line guys were hilariously bad at writing cases) and one of them said that a landlord had torn down a building on our routers and switches which was customarily housed in a dedicated room in the basement (Landlords get discounts for supplying the space and such).

Me: Ma'am, do you have a window facing west?  
L: What?  
Me: Do you have a window facing the building across the street?  
L: Yes, why?  
Me: Please go look out that window and i can tell you exactly what's wrong. (I hear her walking).  
L: Ok, so now what!?  
Me: Is there a building across the street?  
L: What do you mean!? She is starting to sound really annoyed at this point  
Me: There should be a 12 story building across the street. Can you see it?  
L: No, they're building something there.  
Me: Ok. So that is your problem right there. ALL our equipement for your ENTIRE neighborhood was in that building. A building that i just found out that your landlord has demolished WITHOUT TELLING US, meaning that all the stuff needed for your internet is buried under the remains of that building. The things in your building is fine, but the equipement that supplies your building isn't.  
L: SO!?  
Me: So your landlord just broke the internet to your neighborhood.  
L: So fix it? My building is still fine so what does the other one matter!? (Now she was getting pissed again)  
Me: Like i said, yours is fine, but not the connection INTO you building. Those things are buried under what i assume is hundreds of tons of rubble. I can't fix it no matter how much i want to.

What followed next was a good 10-15 minutes of non stop, high pitch yelling about how useless i was. Now we had a policy that said i could just hang up if people were being hostile but i had a plan. FINALLY i got a word in and i explained that in cases like these we technically didn't have to reimburse customers, since the outage was beyond our control but we usually did anyways and that i could(notice the phrasing) grant her up to 10x the value of her service for the time it was out (I was actually only allowed to reimburse customers to a 1:1 ratio, but my teamleader trusted me enough to let me use her levels and just approved it all after the fact). I could litterary hear her perking up on the other end. Especially since i had mentioned that this might take weeks if not months to fix so she was probably seeing 1-2 years of free internet in her mind.

And that's when i shut her down. I simply stated that while i COULD, in this particular case there was simply no way that i WOULD. The line went dead silent. I then heard her draw a big breath but before she could start shrieking again i cut her off saying that before she started screaming at me i wanted her to know that the specific reason she would not be getting any reimbursement was the way she had acted on this call. She sputtered out some surprised sounds and i took the chance to wish her a pleasant day and hung up.

I then proceeded to pin a comment to her customer profile noting that under no circumstances was she ever to get ANY reimbursement for this outage. I then told my teamleader about the whole thing and while she was laughing her ass off, one of my colleagues came up saying he had a customer that wanted to speak to the manager. Me and my teamleader both looked at my colleague and asked for the customers name and sure thing, she was back baby!

My teamleader started laughing uncontrollably, took the headset and while still laughing just said the best thing i had heard at that job up to that point:

""This is Manager. NO you're not getting anyting. YES you deserve what OP did and NO i don't care."" and then she hung up.

Stressful, annoying, actually painful but still one of the best days at that job.

Oh numlock...,"This was something that happened to me about 12 or so years ago now.

While in college I used to provide tech support for the campus computer labs. I would rotate between different labs on campus, and when a user had issues with a computer they could just walk up to the lab tech desk.

This particular user started to approach the desk and just by her walk you knew she wasn’t happy.

&lt;user&gt;: “I have been trying to login for the past 5 mins and my login doesn’t work!”

Back then this campus would use your SSN as your password...Yeah super secure...

me: “Ok, when you’re logging in, you’re using your SSN for your password correct?”

&lt;user&gt;: “Yes! Of course, but it’s not working. It’s telling me my password is incorrect!”

I confirm her username in Active Directory

me: “Ok, let’s go check it out.”

We walk over to the computer she’s using.

me: “Alright, show me what is going on.”

She proceeds to type in her username, which I confirm is her username. She clicks on the password field, stares at the number pad, types in her SSN, and hits enter. While she’s staring at the keyboard she never once looks up to see if anything is even being entered, hits enter, and then looks up.

&lt;user&gt;: “See! It’s like I told you!”

I notice the numlock is off and know exactly what’s going on, but I’m obviously not caring too much for her attitude. I start to slow play the obvious fix...

me: “Oh wow... huh... that’s weird. Try it again.”

She proceeds to roll her eyes, does the same actions again as I’m shaking my head, and she motions to the screen.

&lt;user&gt;: “Well? I know I’m typing it in right.”

me: “Hmmm... type it a little slower”

&lt;user&gt;: “ugh...”

She proceeds to type it very slowly, still not looking up from the keyboard before hitting enter.

&lt;user&gt;: “k... now what?”

She proceeds to cross her arms and stare at me. I look at her, hit the numlock key.

As I’m walking away...

me: “Try it now”

"How I saved a company, with a batch file and SQL UPDATE query","Client’s small business relies on one bespoke program tailored for a niche market. This business has done quite well for more than two decades.

Many feats of support have been performed to keep this program running through the changes from Windows 98 to 2000 to XP to 7 (skipped Vista and 8, yo) to 10. Still chugging along. There’s no hope of upgrading or updating, as the original programmer is unavailable and the source code was not provided.  

(Yes, it’s a damned big security problem now but it’s walled off as much as anything can be.)

Client calls me in a panic, he can’t enter new cases. Seems the program cannot accept case numbers above 9,999 (decimal). This is literally a business-ending problem.

Uh oh. I’ve treated this thing as a “black box” all these years but now it seems I have to open up the box. I’m hoping it’s not Pandora’s.

Poked around a bit and found an MDB file that gets modified regularly. Used a tool found on Sourceforge to open up a copy, it’s an Access 95/97 database that contains case numbers and the associated names. This looks promising!

Turns out that somewhere along the line the case numbers skipped from 999 to 5000, who knows why? Opportunity knocks! Two SQL UPDATE queries later, everything 8XXX is now 2XXX and everything 9XXX is now 3XXX.

But wait, there’s more! Each case is also associated with files named according to case number. Batch scripting to the rescue: FOR statement, string extraction, iterate through … now all the files that had been named 8XXX.??? are now 2XXX.??? and well you get the idea.

Run these against a test copy of the folders and what do you know, the damn thing works. With the nod from the client, run them against the production folders and database. Voilà, the day is saved. All the old cases work, the client can enter new cases, and 2,000 available case numbers will carry the business well past the client’s retirement.

And there was much rejoicing.",2020,0,1
The Desktop Becomes a Tablet,"I had to share this tale, while it was fresh on my mind.

Got a call from a customer today, saying she couldn't get email.  It took about 10 minutes for her describe what she was seeing...  It turns out that her 2 year old Windows 10 desktop suddenly decided it was a tablet, and entered tablet mode upon logging in today.  The task bar was bereft of any icons, aside from Start, Cortana, status tray, and time.  The entire desktop was like Windows 8, with just ""Life at a Glance"", taking up the whole screen.

While this was an older customer, she was thankfully well versed in using keyboard shortcuts.  So with a Windows-R, and an ""iexplore"" we were off to run GoToAssist (she couldn't find IE, Edge, Chrome, or Firefox in ""All Apps"").  About 5 minutes later, and some confusion over the key, I got in, set the computer to NEVER enter tablet mode, and to never Ask to go into Tablet mode.  One more restart, and everything was back to normal.

Needless to say she was happy, and the entire support center, shook their heads at Windows 10.

Man can't be bothered to scan a document a few times.,"I got a new job and I started to work as a System Analyst for a multinational printer scanner and printing and scanning solution company, lets call it company X  ... ;)

Clients either pay for our service or it's part of a contract/warranty. 

My job is quite simple, make sure printers are configured correctly and the printer servers that have print roaming software configured correctly. 

I usually visit clients on-site, as the city I live in is not that big, and I find myself finishing jobs quicker than remote connection and clients leave better reviews. 

However, when there is a client outside my city I always try to solve it remotely and only visit if it isn't something I can do remotely or the systems can't be reached remotely. 

So I connect to the clients PC via remote connection software and I am messing around in the printer configuration, I check the other 3 printers, they all have the exact same configuration, I even get a clone from their config and apply it to the printer at hand for good measure, still nothing, it won't send a scan to email via SMTP.

I get a more senior and experienced colleague to have a look, maybe I am missing something, he is bewildered as well, we telnet the SMTP server through the ports, it's connecting just fine.

So we try a few different configurations and in between, we ask the client who is in the office to try scanning and give us an error code if there is any, after the third time he angry and demands we come to his office, (which I should make clear, all we asked is for him to hit scan on the printer which is no more than 10 meters away from his desk, I know the place I've been there for when it was installed first), I explain that I wouldn't be able to solve the problem by just visiting the site. He doesn't like it, closes the remote connection in my face and the phone, all while the senior system analyst there seeing and hearing what just happened. Just because I needed to contact their IT department to see what we can do together.

I found out immediately that the client has raised a complaint with haste before it went through the right channels. So I explained myself to my manager before him, not to mention I have a witness who said I could CC him if I wanted, he wouldn't mind getting involved in some ""hot action"". That his words lol.

Some email chains later I am of the case and got off scot-free.

Our printers were fine, the problem was from their own SMTP server, they had to white-list the printer's MAC Address.",187,0,1
"“Okay, now what?”","I work for a certain multinational coffee chain in their IT help desk department. Over the years I had a few memorable experiences (the end user who INSISTED I fix the Dulles airport WiFi as it was not working, the woman who truly “accidentally” permanently deleted all of her emails to name a few) but one took the cake. 

A store manager called in, worried because nothing seemed to be online. Not the registers, the WiFi, heck the Spotify music wasn’t even working. Suspecting a power issue at the switch I walked him through how to find it. 

Me: okay. I need you to find the IT rack in your office. It’s where your security camera feeds are, your router, everything. Find the switch! It’s a long black box, lots of cables going into it, hopefully blinking lights. Do you see it? 

Him: hold on. 

Me: *patiently waits for 5 full minutes wondering wtf is going on* 

Him: OK! I unplugged alll the cables in the box! Now what? 



Everything went to that switch and was configured to it’s specific port. This numbskull mixed up 30+ cables all by himself. It took us two days to get it straight. It was an absolute disaster.",1088,0,1
"Salty customer, brings in salty phone.","Had a customer come in with a liquid damaged device that was dropped in the ocean. We brought it in for a diagnostic that is $20 non refundable but goes towards the price of any part or parts if parts fix it or is fixable.


I worked on the customer's device and determined it that the phone wasnt fixable. There was so much salt buildup inside the device that electrical contacts for the cables inside the device had corroded and disintegrated into nothingness. Cleaning the contacts with alcohol just made the contacts worse.


When the customer came back to learn their device wasnt fixable. I watched as they got angry at us and cursed us out for taking $20 to not fix their phone even though we tell them up front its to cover our time to see if the device is fixable in the first place.


The customer left angry and when our service representative came back and vented to us about the exchange. I simply responded ""I guess they were a little salty"" both of my coworkers lost it, knowing about the heavy salt build up in the phone.",1157,0,1
The Big Scary Client.,"Back at my first job as a consultant, one of our clients was a construction company. Overall the company was good to work with, unless you had to deal with the owner.

He was a very intimidating man, that everyone including my colleagues and manager was a little scared of.

He had no problem with yelling at anyone for any reason for things big or small. After I had been with the consulting firm for 4 years, I made the decision to move on.

Given that they were one of our larger customers I made one of my last rounds at their site and let everyone know of my departure.

I walk past the owner’s office and I can see him sitting at his desk.

Me: Popping my head in. Hey Owner, got a minute?

Owner: Yeah what’s wrong now? (Normally we left him alone unless some decision was critical, or something was wrong)

Me: I just wanted you to be aware that my time with (Consulting Firm) is going to end here in the next week and wanted to thank you for working with me.

I expected the normal, okay thank you answer. What I got I did not expect.

Owner: Well this is a loss to us, and your firm. What does the next chapter of your life hold for you?

I told him that I was going to continue schooling in a neighboring state, and that the end game was to be closer to where I grew up.

Owner: Well, I understand. We will miss seeing you around.

We then had a casual conversation, which ended with him standing up walking over and giving me a handshake and thanking me for all that I had done for them.

As I walked out of the building, I was a little dumbfounded. Once I got back to my office, I told the tale to one of my colleagues.

Colleague = C

C: Well, don’t you feel special?

Me: I guess so, it was very odd to hear him talk to me like I was a person.

C: Well take that is a good experience, you had one of the harder people to work with say thank you for your assistance.

What I have found in my time working in IT is that you are appreciated by people, even when it does not seem like it. Not only for the support you provide, but because you deal with them when they are at their worst.

As I read in another TFTS Story.  
""I have found that being a tech support guy is often like being a free therapist that you're allowed to shout at.""

That is the truest statement I have ever read.",439,0,1
Pressing enter boooothers meeeee...,"Background: I was helping a friend who just bought a new NVME SSD with installing windows in it, after the installation is finished, and he's booted up to the SSD I recommend to not format the HDD until he's sure he wont need anything from the old windows instance (software configuration or any file that he forgot to backup), this is the conversation that took place:

&gt;**Me :** Just set everything up on the new Windows and when you can go a week without coming back to the old instance you are mostly safe to format the HDD.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Friend :** I wanted to format it now because when the PC reboots I need to choose which windows instance I want, and it's a bother....  
&gt;  
&gt;**Me :** OOoooohhh Noooo, such difficulty in pressing enter, that makes possibly losing important configs or files worth it.....

Before you say he's just a normal user and anything new scares him, he's currently a security engineer and we used to work together in tech support.

Some people.... 

As a clarification I would rather him use Linux but no one can deny that even with its shortcomings Windows is one of the better pieces of code you can find for an OS. And I don't post a screenshot of the conversation because it's in Spanish and full of (friendly) insults.",221,0,1
I put the correct license and why my firewall feature it is not working!,"Hello all

I would like to share a short story on this.

A few months ago my customer log a case with my company and say that the firewall features is not working due to license issue. He claim that he have put the correct license and was very angry!

We try to get logs file and also screenshot of error however he did not want to give us and insist that he put the correct license. He even say quite nasty stuff on email or phone call with me.

Eventually we have to call in the vendor to assist us with this in a remote session after a few days

Vendor : ""why am I seeing the same license being import 5 times straight!""

Customer was unable to answer why and the vendor just proceed to erase the 4 extra license and everything work normal. The remote summary provided by the vendor was pretty nasty and I just forward it to the customer.",129,0,1
How I managed to shut down the intranet of my company for 2 days,"This happened a few years ago. 

A bit of background: I work at a small bank in Germany. At the time we used a self made intranet for important messages, sharing documents and work instructions. I worked in controlling at the time and used Excel for many tasks. 

Now for the actual incident: we were about to take part in credit pooling for the first time. The company coordinating the pooling process send us some documents and Excel-files we needed for the process itself or afterwards. One of those files was a fairly big xlsm-file (Excel with macros). Since we were not the only department needed for the process we had to get the files to other departments. We didn't want to send the files via E-Mail because the E-Mail-storage was very limited. Since the document-sharing didn't check what kind of document you were sharing I figured out we could upload the files to our intranet. What I didn't know at the time was that the system checked all content of a document so the search engine would be able to find it easier. For pdf-, doc- or small xlsx-files this was not a problem. But the system crashed after I uploaded the big xlsm-file. It took a few minutes to actually crash fully so I didn't make the connection to my file at first. 

2 days later (after our intranet was running again) I get a call from the IT-department explaining that I was responsible for the crash and that they disabled the content reading feature for that file. 

There were no futher consequences for me since our intranet was not crucial for business. I still work there and am now part of the IT-department myself.",1660,0,1
How I dropped Internet access for a whole office/DHCP is more complicated than I thought,"Good day TFTS, I bring you a story from my helpdesk days, about 4 years ago. Despite only really being responsible for first line issues like new starters/leavers and AD/Exchange admin, I occasionally had to dip my toes into deeper water due to the small number of staff in the IT department. On one such day, I was setting up a replacement laptop for a member of our customer IT team, all of whom had reserved IP addresses allowing them specific access through our firewall that the rest of the company did not have.

The process seemed simple, but nobody senior was around to help me if I got stuck, so I knew I had to muddle through somehow. I logged into DHCP, unreserved his IP from his old mac address and added it to his new mac address...or at least, I tried to. It wouldn't add. I can't remember if it errored or just refused to save, but either way, it wasn't happening. The IP range set aside for cusomter IT was quite limited, so if I couldn't add this specific address, I'd have to get a senior engineer to modify the firewall to allow whatever IP I could give him. This would mean a CAB, which met only once a week and included the IT Director, who wouldn't just let it go that the firewall change was needed due to my screw up.

I knew all of this, so naturally I did the worst thing one could do in an unknown system. I googled the problem, and tried some things out (do not do this in something like DHCP or DNS).

Eventually, I found an Allow/Deny list that lets you specify certain allowed mac addresses relating to IPs. Jackpot! I allowed his mac to access the IP and hit save. Tested his access, the IP was correct and he had external access. With that done, I went for a now much delayed lunch break.

I arrived back an hour later and everyone is running around like headless chickens because nobody could get onto the internet, and those who locked their machines, logged out or shutdown now couldn't log in.

The most senior engineer we had walked in just after me and gave a very stoic ""Don't worry boys, I'll handle it"" before trying to login and getting the same access denied message as everyone else.

We quickly realised this was affecting everyone in this building, i.e. everyone governed by one DC. That's when the penny dropped and I walked straight over to customer IT guy, who was happily working away with his headphones on, none the wiser to the chaos around him. I turfed him out of the way, logged into the DC through RDP using my admin credentials, and fixed what I had done. 

I then was introduced to a method by which to scan a network to see which mac has a certain IP. Turns out, in the split second I unreserved the IP, someone elsewhere in the office had come back from a coffee break and been randomly assigned it. Not sure what the chances of that are, but they  can't be high. I got him to do an IPconfig release/renew and claimed the address back to the reservation again.

Once everything was back to normal, I admitted my mistake, my manager made clear that if I were to get stuck again, ASK FIRST and if nobody is around, just leave it and wait.",245,0,1
The over the top video conferencing setup.,"For context I work as a network engineer for schools across the U.K. today I got a ticket in from our deputy head about getting a proper video conferencing solution permanently in place as he thinks even post-Covid it’s superior, I agree. 

To set the scene we’re on break, I’ve got no tickets on autotask and the deputy head is settling in with his coffee. He begins discussing what he wants in his solution. 

DH: Right so you know we’ve got that smart TV in the conference room. I want to have that as our display for zoom. We want a wide angle camera to to get the whole room at least 4K.

Me: seems a bit overkill for a video call. 

DH: no we need the best quality.

DH: For sound we need high quality and the ability to pick up sound across the room but avoid background noise. I’m thinking three Rhode mics in a triangular array hooked up to a volume mixer.

Me: what, why?

DH: their directional mics so we need to three to pick up the whole room.

Me: why not just buy an omni directional mic and turn up the sensitivity and buy a Microsoft wide angle webcam. Jobs done. 

DH: no I need superior quality to that.

Me: well okay if you want we can do it.

DH: good good, the budget is £500

Me: okay...

I proceed to have meeting with my colleagues at the IT company the school contracts and we have a good laugh about the whole thing when I receive a ticket requesting to purchase a £1,000 Logitech conferencing solution. I end up having a email back and forth with him through autotask and after 2 days of convincing I mange to get him to settle on a 1080p webcam, a small form factor computer and a Blue Snowball ICE.

Don't leave your ~$2500 gaming rig unsupervised with a 8-year old.,"Not exactly a qualified technician, but I do know quite a bit about PCs.

One time I received a message from my friend, telling me that his little brother screwed up his gaming rig. The PC was a hand-me-down from his father, costing around \~$2500 in 2007ish. For its time the rig was a beast. Rocking a QX6800, 6 gigs o ram, and 2 GTX 275s in SLI. Note that this was in 2019, so the rig wasn't exactly up-to spec anymore.

I asked him what was screwed up, and he told me that when he went back into his room, he saw that his PC was stuck in a boot loop.

So I went to his home, took the PC to the living room, opened it up. Re-seated the RAM, no change, checked the CPU socket, no bent pins. Went through most of the steps, no change.

Then I went into the BIOS and lo and behold, his brother had somehow set the CPU multiplier to 13, had set the FSB to 300 or something, vcore to 1.6v (note that this was above the safe voltage specified by Intel). The mobo was a cheapo, VRMs were barely able to handle the QX6800's 130w TDP, so the poor VRMs were cooking. Luckily I fixed it before anything bad happened to the PC.

Then I realized that it was a ASUS mobo, and googling the model number gave me a list of specs.

One piece of software that caught my eye was ASUS Ai Suite. He had it installed, and used to it set ""power modes"". It could also change advanced settings, like the FSB and multiplier. So his brother went and messed with the settings and pressed apply, the PC restarted.

Told him to lock the PC when he isn't in the same room as the PC.

# EDIT: For those who think that the title refers to a modern system, it does not. It refers to a 2007 rig.

Holy moly, I didn't expect this thread to take off this much! Thank you, kind strangers.

You've ruined my file structure! - A rubbish story,"Evening all,

So this tale goes back to my days on the support department, I had only been in the job for around 9 months when the following events took place:

**$Me -** IT installation technician of 3 years

**$AngryCust-** The individual on the other end of the call

&gt;**$Me:** Hi thank you for calling TMUK IT, how can I help?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AngryCust:** Hi, I logged a ticket ages ago as my Outlook is slow, I need you to look into it ASAP  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** Of course, let's get remoted on \*Opens up RMM, launches Outlook\*  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AngryCust:** I need this sorting ASAP, my PC should run faster than this, I can't work  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** \*Sees massive Outlook recycling bin, I mean, this bin was huge\*  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** It seems like your Outlook is quite slowed down due to the amount of mailboxes you have open, your recycling bin is quite full too. Do you need all these mailboxes open?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AngryCust:** I need to keep ALL these mailboxes open (We are looking at 10 mailboxes here) as I use them to monitor my staff. Do something else to make it faster  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** Okay, we will clean up the recycle bin then and archive off some emails, are you happy with that?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AngryCust:** I must have access to ALL my emails, I can't open archives  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** Okay then, I'll go ahead and clean the bin  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Deletes bin contents  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AngryCust:** That's a little better, thanks \*ends call\*

&amp;#x200B;

Around an hour passed

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**$Me:** Hi, hows the compute-  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AngryCust:** YOU'VE DELETED ALL MY EMAILS  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** I'm sorry, can you show me whe-  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AngryCust:** THEY'RE ALL GONE, WHERE HAVE YOU PUT THEM  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** I only deleted the ones in the bin  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AngryCust:** WELL THEY'RE ALL GONE, THIS IS £10,000 of WORK, I WILL NEED RENUMERATION  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** Apologies but I have only deleted the emails in this bin \*Shows customer recycle bin\*  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AngryCust:** That's where I keep my archived emails!!  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** I offered to make you an archive which you refused  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AngryCust:** Well this worked until YOU went on my PC  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** The recycle bin is not permanent storage, if you stored your filing cabinet in your recycling bin and then left the bin out would you be angry at the bin man for collecting them?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$AngryCust:** I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOUR BOSS, NOW

&amp;#x200B;

After about 5 minutes of the angry customer speaking to my boss the phone was put down and I was told not to worry, I never actually found out what happened to the customer. I never really spoke to them again or saw them at the site when I visited. I can only presume they must have got confused between their desk and a recycle bin

TL;DR: Customer's Outlook was slow due, I cleaned their recycle bin, turns out customer recycle bin was their version of an archive",235,0,1
Oh the things you'll find,"A couple of weeks ago a ticket comes in, a phishing attempt has been reported by a user.  The source email says it's coming from another user (User Zero from now on) in the company.  I check Barracuda and sure enough, the email source is from User Zero, I run the cleanup, deleting emails from mailboxes, emailing everyone about the phishing email and then call User Zero and leave a voicemail saying that they need to change their password.

A second ticket comes in for the same issue, email back saying that we're rectifying the issue, delete email, change password if you clicked on the link and entered your credentials.

At this point I check who User Zero is.  They're an account manager (sales) out of one of our other offices.  I consider disabling the account as a scream test when ticket 3 shows up.  This time it's from the manager at User Zero's location.  User Zero is out on medical leave so he can't be working so they suspect a compromised account.

At this point I change User Zero's password and go into Azure to see what I can find.  Sign in attempts show in the last 24 hours a bunch of sign ins from Lagos Nigera and the UK.  I expand the results to the last month and my jaw dropped.  More Nigerian logins, more from the UK, a few Russian ones and a handful from the Ukraine.

User Zero calls me, he's gotten the messages and he's changing his password as we speak.  I let him know what happened and he's happy but frustrated over his customers getting phished.  Everything's taken care of and we say our goodbyes.

For some reason the Director of IT was in his office.  Which was unusual because 1) it was close to 4pm and 2) he's been WFH for 2 months now and I've been back in the office for 2 weeks after WFH.  I let him know what happened, he asks me to write up a report so he can inform the higher ups of the breach and what happened and the risks.

I send the email out and copy in my coworker, the AD/O365 primary admin (I'm his backup).  He then sends back a scary report.  Over 50 users have questionable sign ins from China, Nigeria, Turkey, India, Ukraine.

This leads to us force resetting a bunch of passwords, letting our Help Desk know who is going to call and what to do.  My coworker may look into upgrading our Azure AD plan so we can have the automatic monitoring.

I just got an email today from my coworker, one of the people we force reset has odd sign ins again.",183,0,1
"We could fix this for free, but if you want to pay I guess I won’t stop you.","I support a line of industrial equipment that has uses over a wide range of industries. The company I work for actually has several semi-related lines of equipment. While I do know the general concepts behind several of them, the only one I am trained in and know even the basics of how to run is the one that I support. 

One day as I’m sitting at my desk answering emails, I get a call from a certain customer (Kevin). He was struggling with the software related to my line of equipment and needed help getting it working. I start with some of the basic troubleshooting questions, on/off, etc. but no dice. Once the easy things to do are done, I ask him to do something a bit more involved at which point it becomes clear he is not actually at the computer in question. He is at his desk and there is no phone near the equipment’s computer. He had been having one of the technicians run into the room with the computer and do what I asked. I ask if I can remote into the computer. It is not connected to the internet. I ask if he can use his cell near the computer or if there can be a phone connected to that room. He says the IT department will not put a phone there or connect the computer to the internet and that his phone does not get signal in that room. 

At this point I say the magic words that have always convinced customers that maybe they can talk to their IT about solutions. 

$Me: “Well, if you do not want me to fix this over the phone or by remote for free, the only other option is that you pay for me to come out and fix it. Our rate is (awful amount)/hour plus travel costs which in your case would include the flights, car rental, and two nights in a hotel. I can get you a quote if you like.”

$Kevin: “That would be great! Send the quote and I’ll get it approved. By the way, we are also having trouble with #otherlineofequipment. Do you think you can look at that while you are here?”

$Me: “I have no training on and will not be able to do anything with #otherlineofequipment. If I come to your workplace I will only work on #mylineofequipment. Do you still want a quote?”

$Kevin: “Yes, that will be fine. I’ll work on fixing #otherlineofequipment with your co-worker Jenny.”

$Me: “Sounds good. I’ll prepare the quote.”

Now that I know that Kevin knows Jenny I decide to see what I’ve gotten myself into.

$Me: “Hey, Jenny. I’m about to go to Customer’s site to help out with #mylineofequipment issues. What do you know about these guys?”

$Coworker: “Oh great! I’ve sent them (super simple, step-by-step) directions (that a 10 year old could follow) on how to fix their issue with #otherlineofequipement a couple times, but they keep refusing to try it so I’ve been refusing to go fix it. Would you mind giving it a try while you are there?”

$Me: “Looks like you are a smarter person than me. Um...if there is time I guess I can give it a shot.”

Once all the paperwork is out of the way, I set up my flights, bring a printed set of directions from Jenny and head to “sunny” Placeville. 

After reaching the site and checking in, Kevin brings me to the equipment. The first thing that I notice is that about 3 feet away from the computer is a telephone. The second thing that I notice is that there are two friendly technicians named Tech1 and Tech2 who actually do the day to day. 

$Kevin: “Me, glad you are here! I hope you’ll be able to fix our problems with #otherlineofequipment. It’s really been slowing us down. This is Tech1 and Tech 2. They are the ones who actually use the equipment.”

$Tech1: “I’m definitely excited to have #otherlineofequipment back at its usual efficiency.”

$Tech2: “Yep.”

$Me: “As I said in my emails earlier, I do not know anything about #otherlineofequipment and have never used it in any capacity. I have not even turned one on at any point. I will happily fix your issues with #mylineofequipment, but when it comes to #othelineofequipment I have no knowledge that will help and can only call the same help phone number that you do. I have brought with me the instructions that Coworker has sent to you before, so if there is time I will try and follow that. That is the extent of what I can and will do for you.”

$Kevin: “I’ll be in my office if you need me. Thanks for looking at #otherlineofequipment!”

$Tech1: “We were having problems with #mylineofequipment?”

$Tech2: “Oh yeah, we had some small file issue that I had a workaround for. It would be nice to not have to use the workaround.”

$Me: “I’ll start with that.”

After considerable fighting with their local IT over whether or not software installation requirements really are required, I was able to get #mylineofequipement back up and running correctly. At this point I could have taken lunch, but there were no restaurants close and I was hating being there, so I went straight for fixing #otherlineofequipment. Following the directions from Jenny was easy enough and got the equipment 90% fixed. I called Jenny, who lead me through the next steps and thought I was done. 

$Me: “OK, well, that’s about it. If you could fill out this paperwork saying I was here I’ll get going.”

$Kevin: “Actually, the problems with #otherlineofequipment started when the original software became corrupted. Could you transfer the files for the equipment parameters to the new PC? I don’t recall what the parameters were and don’t have a record because I had an intern set it all up 7 years ago.”

$Me: “I’ll take a quick look.”

The parameters were completely corrupt, so I was finally able to leave. And that is the story of how something that should have taken about an hour and been free cost my customer many hours and a few thousand dollars. 


Epilogue: I also found out that all the parameters for #mylineofequipment were set up by that same intern. In other words, a highly paid “engineer” knew nothing about the process, what different signals in their equipment meant, or how to run the equipment in the slightest. Supervising the techs who ran this equipment was this person’s entire job. I’m not sure what he did with his time. The cherry on top: weeks later I learned that their finance department was refusing to pay because the bill was lower than the quote. It took several phone calls and an email asking if they would prefer to pay for hours not worked before they finally paid up.",172,0,1
Tech support on a professional level,"As much as I enjoy the stories of the tech-illiterate masses, you have to remember there's a different side to it.

Some years ago at I place I worked at we had some problems with a fairly niche specialty sensor.

Damn thing wouldn't give us a signal.

So we did a lot of troubleshooting ourselves, wipped out the oscilloscope and did a bunch of testing to no result.

So we compiled a E-Mail to the generic support@[company].com of the manufacturer which included oscilloscope screen caps, a wiring diagrams and our previous troubleshooting.

Next day at the beginning of the shift we had a answer of the goddamn lead-engineer that developed the sensor.

It was something like:

""Yep we had the same issue during development, you have to seperate power and signal ground and the explosion-environment version of the sensor you're using needs a higher supply voltage.""

I was genuinely amazed.

And at night I still dream about a world where everybody can communicate issued like that in a precise technical language.",167,0,1

So I was clearing out my test closet and I gave a HP EliteBook to my girlfriend who generally only works with Dells.

&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** Did you manage to find a HP charger for it?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$GF:** I'm using the one I have  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** No, I said not to use that one as it wont work, it's not the right charger  
&gt;  
&gt;**$GF:** But they look the same  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** Whilst they look the same they are not, please go buy a HP or generic one  
&gt;  
&gt;**$GF:** Fine \*Proceeds to order generic one\*

Several days later the new charger turned up and worked fine and to this day I remind her that just because two ends look the same, it does not make it so",110,0,1
You know what they say about when you assume!,"When I was in college, I worked a walk-up IT job at a university library, where patrons could walk up with tech related problems (I use 'tech' very loosely here) and we would do our best to fix them. One time a known problem user came to us unable to add his email account to a new iPhone. I had been warned about this particular patron, but until then I had had mildly pleasant interactions with him - usually harmless banter when he would come by with a problem. This time he had a haircut scheduled, so he dropped his phone off with us to add the account so that it would be done by the time he got back.

As soon as he left I realized that I wouldn't be able to finish adding the account until he got back, because one of the steps requires entering the account password, which he hadn't left with us (and as a matter of practice, patrons usually wouldn't). So about 45 minutes later he comes back to pick up his phone, and I tell him we'll be done in just a minute and could he please enter his password so I can finish adding the account. He asks why I need the password and I explain that it's just part of the steps needed to add a new mail account to his phone. He then says that is in fact not what he needed help with. As it turns out, either I misunderstood what he has asked when he dropped the phone off, or he didn't explain it well - either way, there was a miscommunication and he actually needed something else done (can't quite remember now, I think he maybe needed a calendar imported from one of his mail accounts or something). So I apologize for having jumped the gun and assuming I understood his request, and then said without thinking

""But I guess you know what they say about when you assume!""

(the standard response I know being ""it makes an ass out of 'U' and 'me'). After a sudden and uncomfortable silence, he says quite coldly ""I don't think I've been made an ass of here"", taking the completed version of the adage quite literally. The interaction was so immediately uncomfortable. It took a bit to figure out exactly what he wanted, and in that time my boss came out from the back to check on things, when this patron promptly informed him that I had implied he was an ass. My boss, trying to save face, apologizes profusely and takes over adding the account. I got a talking to after, even though this guy was known to be problematic.

I have not used that saying since and whenever I see it I am reminded of easily one of the more uncomfortable encounters on the job. That job was a good one, especially for a student, but I sure am glad I don't work there anymore.",78,0,1
"Angry Karen challenges me - ""YOU'RE LYING!!! My son would never do that!""","I got recommended here by a friend who thinks the world needs to hear my stories from when I worked as a laptop technician. I'm new to Reddit so be patient with me lol.

This story took place about a year into the job. I started working in the repair shop as counter staff, but got bumped to assistant manager and then technician, so I often found myself alternating roles wherever I was needed on the day. One summer day I'm about to clock out and go on my lunch break when a customer comes in with a laptop. She seemed pretty pissed off, so I held back to help her out as my work colleagues were all with other customers. This customer quickly turned into a Karen within minutes.

**$Me:** Hi how can I help you :D

**$Karen:** I bought this stupid laptop a few days ago from here and it already stopped working. It's my son's laptop so I need it looked at immediately.

The repair shop was pretty big, so we also did a lot of business selling second-hand phones/tablets/laptops, as well as a bunch of different accessories. Immediately I recognize the laptop she's brought in as I was the one who had prepared it to be sold earlier that week. A very distinct bright blue HP (can't remember what model it was but doubt it matters) Immediately my gut instinct tells me this is a sus situation.

**$Me:** So what kind of problems are you having with the machine?

**$Karen:** My son only used it for a few days, and then it started slowing down and now doesn't work at all.

**$Me:** That's no problem, I'll help you out here at the counter and try to resolve the issue for you quickly.

I open the machine up at the counter and the os is completely destroyed. Corrupted shortcuts on the desktop, the machine is crashing whenever I'd try to open file explorer, command prompt, etc. My standard guess in this situation would be a hard drive failure, but I had installed a brand new hdd in the machine, so this situation screamed like Karen isn't telling me the whole story. I was on the job long enough to trust my instincts with customers, and seeing as I was the last person to touch the machine before her I knew it was almost definitely one of two options. Either A: both the lab as well as me missed something which was very unlikely. Or B: The customer damaged the machine and is trying to play it off like it's our fault. I wasn't about to make any assumptions, but this customer had an attitude, a kind that's very distinct from the usual frustrated customer, an attitude you'd only get from customers who were ready to start a fight.

I explain to Karen what I can see on her desktop, and that this kind of problem can only be resolved once the technician has taken a proper look. I explain our book in procedure, that we will take in the machine and test it, and then call her within 24 hours with an update on what we've found. Unsurprisingly shes huffing over having to leave the machine in the shop. When booking in a repair like this we take a full report from the customer of what had occurred, in case we need to build a case for any reason, so I get to asking her some standard questions.

**$Me:** So when did you start noticing these problems with the machine?

**$Karen** Only this morning when I turned it on, it was fine last night.

**$Me:** You mentioned your son uses the machine, did he mention noticing anything wrong at any time over the past few days?

The mentioning of her son set Karen off and she starts snapping in front of all the other customers. I know I've hit a nerve here and her son is involved in this story somehow.

**$Karen:** My son is none of your concern! You are dealing with me here!

Now the aim of the game here with a wild Karen is to calm her quickly, as any provocation could set her off into a wild rampage. Using my ""amazing"" charm I explain to Karen that I understand her frustration, but for me to properly assess the damages and help her I need to know how the machine has been used. She calms and starts complying.

**$Karen:** My son rarely used the machine, I only gave it to him for a few hours to play his games.

**$Me:** Can I ask what games those where?

**$Karen:** Only Minecraft and Roblox. He's too young to know how to do anything himself.

Now I know this woman is either clueless or lying to my face, as I can clearly see the Steam launcher on the desktop, as well as a bunch of other scattered games and game folders. So I decide to test her story.

**$Me:** Ma'am I'm just going to ask you a few questions about what I can see here. Do you know what steam is?

**$Karen:** No.

**$Me:** And have you ever heard of any of the following programs: Warthunder, TF2, etc. etc.

**$Karen:** No. No. No.

**$Me:** Okay ma'am if you will give me one minute I would just like to take your hard drive into the back and run a quick scan to see what other data I can see.

She gives permission, so I take the laptop in the back and plug the hdd into our system, and find exactly what I was expecting. The local disk has been completely destroyed, assumedly by her son. Half installed game folders everywhere. Files pulled out of (x86) and dumped on the desktop, in the recycle bin. This kid has even pulled folders out of what I assume is (Windows) and done the same, thrown pieces of the os at random around the local disk. Now I don't suspect she did any damage herself, but it's evident someone deliberately fucked the laptop, likely her son. She clearly knows this and is trying to play the issue off like this damage was there from when we sold her the machine. I show the damage to the other technician who works with me and he agrees with my assumption. Now comes the tricky part, confronting the beast. The two of us go out to Karen and explain what we have found.

**$Me:** Ok, so I opened up your files in the back and have found the issue causing your problems.

We pull up screenshots we made in the back and show them to Karen on our tablets in the front of the store. We proceed to explain what she is looking at, and that this damage was caused by someone moving files and possibly deleting portions of the os. Pointing out evidence that conflicted with Karen's story sent her into a fiery rage against me and the technician.

**$Me:** Is there any chance your son may have done this damage, could you have left him alone with the machine at any point?

**$Karen:** How dare you call me a Liar! my son would have never have done this, and neither have I! You're clearly trying to push your own errors on to me! I want a refund!

**$Me:** Ma'am I am not calling anyone a liar, I can only make assessments based on the evidence I have here. What I know is that the damage caused to your laptop was done by a person, and I know this damage was not present when the laptop was put up for sale earlier this week. We take screenshots and full reports of all devices before they are put out for sale. Regardless of who caused this damage, this voids your warranty on the machine, and you are not eligible for a refu-

**$Karen:** Give me the owner's number right now! I am going to get you punished for your rudeness!

**$Me:** Ma'am I legally cannot give you the owner's private number. If you want you can leave your own number, and I can have him call you the next time he is in the store. For now all I can do is book in your machine and have the technician assess it for you.

**$Karen:** Then get me your manager! You are not getting out of talking to me like this!

**$Me:** Ma'am I am the manager on site right now. Again, I am sorry for this inconvenience but all I can do for you is book in your machine for an assessment and repair.

Seeing that neither of us are budging to her raged screaming, Karen falters to the pressure. She shifts into a passive-aggressive mood and has me book in her laptop for a repair, all while I maintain my standard happy composure to the customer. I hand her the repair docket and wish her a nice day. She storms out of the building. I wasted 30 minutes of my lunch break helping a Karen -\_\_- But the salt was  too much not to pass up on

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: Karen claims I sold her a faulty machine, I show her evidence that her son damaged the machine. She calls me a liar and loses her shit.

(I get that I may seem pretty biased against Karen in my assumptions, but this is my telling of the story now after looking back on everything, filling in and compressing info to cut down on the 30 plus minute dialogue with her. I give every customer the benefit of the doubt until I have evidence that says otherwise)

Edit: Holy shit 2k upvoted already, thanks for the warm welcome to the sub :D

Edit 2: Silver as well? I've no fucking clue how medals even work but thank you stranger. You've convinced me to keep posting my stories :D

Also I wanted to address some of the repeating comments I've seen. Since we are an IT repair shop primarily, we treat the software and hardware warranty as two separate warranties. She voided her software warranty but the hardware was undamaged and still covered. All repairs are given a warranty as well, so she was covered for both sw and hw at the end of it, albeit a considerably shorter warranty now on the sw.

Secondly, some of you pointed out the unlikelihood that it was a HP machine. I did some research and you're most likely right. I've no idea why I remembered it as a HP, I only mentioned the distinct colour of it to emphasize the short space of time between it leaving the store and coming back within the week destroyed.",3029,0,1
"I'm sorry Karen, I am going to need to speak with your IT Department...","This wont be a very long post, but as a bit of background I work at a printer repair/delivery/setup company and we deal with quite a few calls, but this one made me laugh a little bit. 

I got a call in my queue for a set up scan to email.  

Now since this was set up a few months earlier this would now be a charge call, but I delivered this machine and clearly remember their IT Department requested that we do NOT set up scan to email. 

So I called the customer,

Me:  Good morning I am calling about your scan to email issue.

Her: Yeah, you guys forgot to set up scan to email when you delivered this machine, I have to have scan to email for me to work. 

Me: I understand ma'am,  I was the one who set up the machine, and I was instructed by your IT Department not to set up scan to email, and that scan to folder would be more then enough. 

Her: Well that's unacceptable I need it to work can you set it up?  

Me:  Well I would need to speak with the IT Department to set up scan to email, would you be able to transfer me to them so I can speak with them about this?

Her: I'll give them a call and call you back. *click*

Me, expecting this to be over, tells dispatch what happened, and we laugh a bit. Then about 5-10 minutes later I get a call back.

Her: Hey I called my IT guy and be said it's fine, can you set it up?

Me:  Alright, would I be able to speak with them, I need some information from them so I can set it up.

Her: What do you not believe me?

Me: Its not that ma'am, I just need the SMTP information and mail server settings so I can get it set up.  

Her: You're making things up, you dont need that, I want you to set up scan to email on my printer now. 

Me: Ma'am, I apologize for the inconvenience but I still need to discuss that with your IT Department because this would be a charge call if I set this up, and they will need to know why there is a charge in addition to giving me the required information. If you feel this is inadequate I can transfer you to my supervisor. 

Her: It shouldn't be a charge call, it was supposed to be set up when you installed it. 

Me looking at the email that says otherwise:  No ma'am, it says not to set that up. I have it here, that ""if IT decides later to set up scan to email they will set it up themselves and has the option to call us for support"", so if we are going to support setting it up they will have to pay for support.

Her: Well, I guess I'll give them a call.


I followed up by calling dispatch again to let them know, and gave a heads up to my manager in case she calls, and about 15-20 minutes I get another call from her.

Her:  Hey I called them and they agreed can you set it up. 

(I know she didnt, but I have no other calls at the moment, so oh well...) 

Me: That's great, did they give you the SMTP server information I requested?

Her:  Oh you think you are so clever?

Me: I'm sorry?

Her: You think I am going to fall for you trying to trick me into telling you I didnt call IT dont you?

Me (Holding back laughter):
No ma'am, you need the smtp server information so you can set up scan to email.

Her: Well, I need it to work, and IT approved it so do it.

Me: Alright ma'am, do you mind if I put you on hold for a moment?

Her: No, I do mind.  (This is what she said)


I called my manager to get the ITs number and gave them a call.  

Me: Hey IT Head, this is ME, I am calling about this person who wants to set up scan to email on the printer we set up. 

IT:  Yeah, no we aren't doing that, and neither are you. She is wrong and I need to speak with her apparently.  

Me: well I have her on hold and can let you speak to her now.

IT: Perfect go ahead. 


So I combine the calls...

Me: alright ma'am, I am here with your IT Department Head, and he wanted to talk about how you aren't allowed to have scan to email...

IT: Yeah, you aren't having scan to email, you have scan to folder.  If you need to email it you can attach it to the email afterwards.  If you try this again you will be locked out of our systems, and will lose your job.  We do not play with the security of our systems.  Any questions?

Her:  I am the manager of this location and I am telling you I need this.

IT: No you dont need it. If you need it we dont need you.  I have your supervisor on speed dial if you want to discuss this with him.

And the moral to this story, dont go behind your ITs back.",233,0,1
"Doc surrounds himself with idiots, blames software support.","Gotta rant on this one:

So my last call of the day today was a doctor at an office we sold 3 systems to a couple months back, and he immediately starts laying into me:

DrKevin (obligatory not his name):
‘It’s been nothing but problems since we purchased this system, you guys fix it and it breaks a day later... we spent thousands of $ on a system that doesn’t work... were losing thousands of $ cuz we can’t take X-rays.. etc.’

Then he tells me to call the office back in 5 mins to talk to his assistant. Awesome, dude literally just wanted to complain. 

So I call the office immediately cuz otherwise I’d risk getting another call and not be able to call out at all, and after explaining that to the bitchy receptionist who said ‘doc told you to call back in 5 mins’ she put me on hold. While waiting i peruse the notes for all 3 offices. 

Not even joking, 100% of the calls we’ve logged that were actual issues are user related and/or Network related. As software we support, we don’t manage anything with network. We ping, flushdns, and tell users to enter their network creds. That’s about the extent of what we’re allowed to do because.. well, *SOFTWARE* support. Period. 

Examples of the calls?

- client workstation won’t connect to the database. Server is 192.168.1.x and client is 10.1.10.x. Entirely different networks. ‘But you guys fixed it just the other day!’ Note from that day reads my colleague chose the correct office WiFi and you entered the password. ‘It is the right WiFi!’ Then I don’t know what to tell you. Call your IT. 
- IT called us because the office is saying they can’t take xrays, admits that they’ve been in process of overhauling their network. Thru discussion, it’s determined the can’t connect to the device because they *removed* the router that enables the device to connect, didn’t think it served any purpose. Ignorance is bliss. Can’t blame em too much for not knowing, but I truly don’t understand the umpteen calls we got after we clearly explained the purpose of the router, all related to the router not being present. 
- last Thursday, office calls cuz they can’t take xrays. Tech has caller reboot the panel. After 3 reboots with no change, it’s discovered caller is rebooting the *wrong thing*. She pushes the right button and they’re back in business. 

Which leads me to my call today. Same chick from last Thursday, and not surprisingly, exact same reason for calling. Device isn’t powered on. She *admits* it was exactly what she went thru on Thursday. Then asks, ‘could it be my iWatch? Cuz they didn’t have any problems before I started filling in here, I normally work at the other office...’ no Karen, you’re iWatch has nothing to do with the power button. 

So she powers it on, and it immediately powers itself back off after displaying a low battery. ‘Ok, switch the batteries, Karen’. Then all is good. 

Then Karen asks, ‘I took xrays today can you get them back?’ Of note: this particular IR does have internal storage, but: ‘no Karen, the device was off when you took the images. There’s literally nothing can be done about that.‘

AND THEN she asks, ‘so how can we prevent this issue?’ 

.....
.........
I.....

.... I can’t even.....

oh yeah, you bet your ass I told my boss to let sales know to deny *ANY AND EVERY* demand for refunds or discounts cuz the way the doc was talking, I feel it coming. 

TL;DR: doc complains he bought a shoddy system when it is *readily* apparent that all issues stem *directly* from users and office IT.",227,0,1
The Old Man and IT - Quarantine Boogaloo,"Y'all, this is going to be a long one that I am sure all of you or at least most of you can relate to, and will most likely bring up some deeply forgotten mental trauma.

\- We use ConnectWise as an RMM. 

\- The user is in quarantine at a local hotel. Internet is trash, but workable. 

\- User is in the ballpark of 8,000 years old and has troglodyte-level knowledge of computers.

Me: ME

User: USER

A ticket came in from one of the higher ups for one of our larger clients requesting that we call USER and help him access their accounting web portal.

\*Call Number 1\*

Me: Hey is this USER? Hi my name is ME with COMPANY NAME REDACTED calling to give you a hand with UNNAMED ACCOUNTING WEB PORTAL

User: Can I call you back in 5 mins, I am finishing up a teleconference

Me: That's fine, I have the next hour blocked out to assist you with this and my next phone apt isn't until 3:30pm. End of call

\*30 minutes later my phone rings with USER's number on the CID\*

Me: Hey USER, are you ready to get going on this issue?

User: Yeah, sorry about that. I finished the call and tried to catch the end of a movie on the TV, got distracted.

Me: (Already rubbing temples) No worries, do you know the name of your computer?

User: Uhhh yeah, it's \*proceeds to read the brand and model\*

Me: Uh no I need the laptop name, should be a sticker on the hand rest with the name?

User: Nothing there, how can I find it

Me: \*Walks user through 4 different ways to find the name: hostname, control panel, system information, about this PC\* Do you see the name?

User: Uhhhhhh \*long pause of dead air with a deep sigh after\* no, it says web results for hostname

Me: \*Walks user through the other 3 different ways I mentioned again\* What do you see now?

User: \*ANOTHER OVER EXAGGERATED DEEP SIGH\* I don't see anything, it just keeps telling me web results for whatever I type

Me: \*Trying my hardest to keep cool\* Okay, type control panel

User: K \*SIGH\* done

Me: What do you see?

User: The box just says Control Panel with the cursor flashing

Me: \*Contemplating fully loaded Russian Roulette\* Press enter

User: Okay now it just shows me a bunch of icons

Me: Click on the one that says system

User: Okay the computer name says Intel Core i5

Me: Below that \*Internal Screaming\*

User: 16 GB

Me: Further below that, you should see a section that says computer name

User: OH, well why didn't you just say that! It's COMPUTERNAME-19 

PAY VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE NAME HE GAVE

Me: \*Searches RMM list of computers\* Alright I don't see that on here, lets get a remote session going

Me: \*Gives very specific instructions\* Okay now you are going to want to open Edge

User: What is Edge

Me: Do you see a blue E on your desktop

User: Yeah it's there

Me: Double Click

User: Okay now what

Me: Type in the address bar [help.REDACTED.com](https://help.REDACTED.com)

User: Okay I have search results

Me: No, in the address bar type [help.REDACTED.com](https://help.REDACTED.com)

User: Same as before, search results

Me: \*Sincerely calling an old folks home to come get an escaped denizen\* Alright, I am going to email you EXACTLY what I need you to type in that address bar

\*Email sent to user\*

User: Alright I got it and typed it in but I am still getting search results

Me: Are you typing it into a search bar or the address bar

User: Search bar

Me: \*Vibrating from pure anger\* I need you to type that into the address bar

User: Oh, well why didn't you just say that in the first place! \*Website pulled up properly\* Okay now what?

Me: \*Gives EXTREMELY specific steps SLOWLY for how to download and run the agent\*

User: Surprisingly follows the instructions with minor errors

This part doesn't really have conversation, just more pure rage that I am sure is going to send me further down the rabbit hole of depression. Remember the name of the laptop that the user gave? Here's where that comes in, mind you, this call is already at the 40 minute mark so I am 20 minutes late for my next call:

Me: Alright now that you can access [REDACTED.com](https://REDACTED.com) for your accounting work, I am going to put our remote agent on the laptop so we don't have to repeat this process

User: \*Continuously moves mouse preventing me from doing my work\*

Me: Can you please stop moving the mouse, it prevents me from doing my work. \*Starts the install of the custom agent meant specifically for this client\*

User: Oh my bad, won't happen again sir \*Near Nuclear Levels of Sarcasm\*

Me: No worries, let me just make sure this install goes through without fault

Suddenly, a wild warning pops up on the screen ""LabTech agent installation has failed for the following reasons: Agent is already installed at this location

Me: \*Confusion intensifies\*

I went back to the system page to find, low and fucking behold, that USER added a 1 in front of the number in the name of the laptop. The actual name? COMPANYNAME-9. Take a wild guess what was already in ConnectWise and invalidated 90% of the pain and frustration I just suffered? You guessed it, USER's laptop

Me: \*Blacking Out from the Near-Toxic Levels of BRUH I was Experiencing\* Alright USER looks like you're good to go, take care and have a great quarantine!

Now, I am going to go drink myself into a mindless trance and hopefully repress this hellish memory so that I can relive it tomorrow with another geriatric that someone let have a computer.

You mean the laptop needs wires?!?!,"Hey all,

So as I do a brain dump of all the trials and tribulations I have been through in my young IT career I thought this one might perk the interest of some people. Let's set the scene.....

**$Me** \- Young support tech, 5 months on the job at the time

**$Cust** \- Customer who is an ""IT Manager"" (Really they are the office manager but..... many hats right?)

**$ExTech -** Technician who as dealt with **$Cust** several times before

So it's about 11AM and I pick up the call queue...

&gt;**$Me:** Hey, you've reached TMUK support, how can I help  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Cust:** Hi, I bought a monitor this week, it's brand new and my laptop isn't working with it. It needs fixing ASAP  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** Sure, we can sort that. So, just to confirm the monitors all plugged in with the blue cable, power cable and that it's turned on?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Cust:** Of course it is, everything is connected and switched on  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me**: Great, and on the computer can right click on the desktop and go to display settings  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Cust:** I've been in there, there is only one screen  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** Okay, that's odd, are you happy to press the menu button on the monitor to make sure it is working  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Cust:** Of course it's working, it's powered on with the light, we've been over this!  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** Apologies, I wanted to make sure the monitor isn't defective  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Cust:** Well it's brand new, of course it works  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** It's very odd, it's as if the monitor isn't plugged into the PC  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Cust:** Let me talk to **$ExTech** he will sort it as the laptop is a wireless one he has worked on  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** Apologies, I didn't quite catch that, did you say the laptop was wireless  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Cust:** Yes, we paid alot for this laptop, it is wireless  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** I'm sorry but that's not how it works, to setup wireless displays you need a compatible monitor or an adapter to plug into the monitor. Just to confirm, the blue cable is plugged into the PC?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Cust:** No, because it's wireless  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Me:** Can you plug the blue cable into the chunky port on the laptop?  
&gt;  
&gt;**$Cust:** Oh, it's working now

Kid refuses to use ethernet asks us to fix the internet,"The title is self explanatory and one of my colleague dealt with this not myself.  
We provide (into other things) Tech support for various companies including games.  


This kid messages us to complain that he keeps being logged out and lose connection,  
We explain to him the usual: make sure to use a cable connection not the wifi, verify that the firewall exception is added etc and tell him that if none of the list we gave him work we will need his logs to help him.  
Kids sends back the logs, nothing seems off, connection is cabled but not super fast but should be more than enough speed-wise. Colleague tries to give him advice and support as best as possible but kid claims nothing his helping....  


And then comes the confession: the kid plugged the ethernet cable for the logs but is now back to using Wi-fi.  
Why? does he not always have access to the cable? is he forced to use the wifi? No he just plainly does not wanna use it and insists he wants to use is wifi and surprise.. after receiving the new logs his wifi is not stable, barely good enough to load a youtube video without stuttering.

And that's when he turns into an entitled kid and start to say it's our job to boost his connection, that we need to make it work for him on the wifi because he doesnt want to use the cable. He obviously refused our advice to see with his parents and isp if there was a way to get a more stable connection but obviously he did not listen.

Last i heard my coworker gave him a warning on language and closed the ticket.",194,0,1
Did you just close that?,"So I should state this is from my early days as a ""Hybrid Technician"" (Essentially a mix of support, installation and proactive maintenance). It's not great but it sticks in my mind as one of the weirder events of my career

Essentially my MSP had just sold a massive contract to a local business however in order to keep everyone happy they sold the MD of said business a brand spanking new gaming laptop and an SSD upgrade for his gaming PC. I'm sent to his house (Weird as we don't generally do personal site visits) to install it.

For the record, I get on well with the MD, he's a nice chap and is fairly down to earth

When I get there the following happened.

**$Me -** Hi, I'm here to install an SSD into **$CoolMD's** PC

**$MDWife -** Oh.... right, I'm just teaching **$MDSon1** at the moment, the PC is in the other room

**$Me** \- OkiDoki, \*Wanders to room\* and starts installing SSD

\*All of a sudden their is the sounds of two kids yelling, **$CoolMDs** voice and a dog

**$CoolMD** \- Hey, glad you came, I need this PC upgrading with the new SSD

**$Me** \- Sure thing

I head off to use the facilities only to return to the dog licking the motherboard of the computer, luckily everything is fine and I make friends with the small doggo however then the following happens. Their is however screaming in the other room as presumably **$MDSon1** wasn't happy with learning at home

**$Me -** \*Starts installing Windows 10 upgrade onto existing SSD and moving files to new SSD\*

**$MDSon2 -** \*Wonders into room\*

**$Me** \- I'm not sure you should be in here but as long as you don't touch anything it's fine, but speak to your dad first okay

\*\*$Me - \*Goes to find **$CoolMD\***

**$Me -** Erm, that's not how I left it

**$MDSon2** \- I didn't touch it

**$Me** \- Fair enough but the screen is gone and their is no installer running now and the FortNite launcher is open

**$MDSon2 -** Just leaves without saying anything

Turns out, the kid decided to bin off the file transfer and Windows 10 install so he could play fornite, effectively binning off 30 mins worth of downloads and file transfers.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I went to customers house, customers son cancels file transfer and Windows 10 upgrade, icing on cake was dog licking motherboard and screaming coming from other room",193,0,1
Excuse me while I whip this out...,"Here's a lighthearted one for you guys.  
No angry customers or incompetent managers.

A decade and a bit ago I was working in an office doing residential internet tech support. Our NOC had just finished cleaning up... something. Server room, storage locker, I'm not really sure.  
They brought in a couple of cardboard boxes of cables into the support center (the ""tech pit"" as we called it) for anyone to scavenge anything they'd like for personal use before the contents were thrown out. It was almost entirely network cables, but I think there was a USB hub or two as well. Just odds and ends from previous projects or installations. I'm sure we all have a box like that in a cupboard or closet somewhere.

So people would get off their calls, poke around, find something that they thought they could use, and the boxes got picked through pretty quickly.  
I managed to scoop up half a dozen or so cables of various lengths.

It was the cooler time of year, but not snowing, so I had a large trench coat, with massive pockets inside, so I stuffed the cables in that for when I went home at the end of the day.

Cut to the trip home on public transit. I was taking the Skytrain (Vancouver BC). Picture a subway, but on elevated tracks instead of buried ones, and you're pretty well there.  
End up seeing an acquaintance, friend of a friend sort, and sat down for a chat since we're both going to be on the same train for the next 15 minutes or so.  
He gets to telling me about how he's just rearranged a room recently and was annoyed by having to use a 50 foot cable when his modem and router were right near each other.  
So I asked how long of a cable he needed. He said maybe a foot.  
So I reach into my jacket, pull out a foot long cable, and hand it to him.  
He said ""thanks"" like it wasn't anything abnormal and we continued chatting, all while a couple of people who overheard the conversation had really puzzled looks on their faces.",2280,0,1

Me: “No, that’s perfectly normal”

Client: “Oh okay”

Look into my eyes? you are fired,"This is un update for the post of the lady who did now know about CTRL+C/V, you can read that story here: https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/gpcimf/cant_even_understand_ctrlcv/

People wanted to know what happened with ""Number"" so here it goes.

Background: A few years ago, I used to work for one of the Big Four Accounting companies as an on-site tech support along with a coworker and our supervisor. when the company opened a new office location, my coworker changed to the new office to train the new guys and we will speak daily over the phone about what was happening on each location, in one of those calls he told me about a manager.

So, my coworker would tell me about different things that ""Number"" would try to pull on everybody just because she was a manger (Very important note, she was the manager for the ethics and compliance team, having around 10 employees report directly to her).

She was the stereotype of the Karens, if she asked for something and she had to wait to receive assistance from any of us she will just stand right behind you watching you and ask
Number: ""what are you doing right now?""
Number: ""and now?""
Number: ""would you be able to assist me right now?""
Number: ""what is so important that you cannot help me, I am a manager you know?"".

And one of my favorites when she needed our help precisely at 1 pm for some reason and i responded to her.
Me: ""we will not be available to assist you at that time as we have to provide training to almost 80 new joiners to the office, if you are free after 1 pm we can assist, or we can even provide you with assistance right now""
Number:""ok, thanks I’ll see you at 1 pm"".
Me: ""Like i said we cannot go there at 1 pm.""
Number: ""you know that i will your manager know about your attitude to have this be on your performance review?""



We would mostly ignore her and most of the times that did the trick, but we were also friends with some of the guys working from here so we would hear things like, that she would have her employees write the emails for her the she would later sent, if you were a woman she would treat unfairly compared to your male counter parts.
Like she would ask one of the ladies to write one of her emails and would go.
Number: ""how did you even get a job in here if you do not know how to write something so simple and basic?"".

So she goes to one of the men of the team and ask 
Number: ""hey Man, did you review these before the lady i asked her sent me the email?"" Male Employee: ""yeah i did, i did not find anything wrong.""
Number: ""ok, then it is good"".

Well to cut the story short, after many things just like that, i had the manager in my sight, i just needed a reason. and one day she comes to my office, asks for something stupid and i say ""ok, i will finish to write an email and i will go by your desk, it shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes"".

But instead of leaving, she just stands there besides me, looking at me with dead eyes, trying to intimidate me, so i ignored her, but before leaving the office she decides to ""accidently"" step on my feet with the heels of her shoes. and that was it, i went to HR. 

This was on a Wednesday, i go to HR i say ""i would like to submit a formal report against Manager"", i later found it that she had multiple complaints reported by her employees, but i guess HR waited to receive a complaint from somebody outside of the team to see if things were as bad as they have been told.

So, on Friday of that very same week i received a call from the HR partner, (one of my responsibilities as IT was to assist on the termination process of employees, disable the accounts, grab the laptop, etc etc). so the HR partner tell me ""Pave42, could you please go to the meeting room 3"", at that point i didn't know what was happening, but when i entered the room and i see ""Manager"" in the table crying, and i can still remember the taste of those tears, the taste of victory, of Karma. I knew exactly that she was being fired.

That goes to show that eventually, Karens who threaten to put you in trouble, will eventually get in more trouble than they bargained for.

TL; DR: Karen tries to intimidate me with hear dead eyes stare, gets fired instead.",1327,0,1
Don't assume people understand from context,"This happened around 2012. 

I worked in a computer lab in my university. We were required to answer users' questions and assist them in the lab. 

Our computer labs did not have photo copiers. The labs had computers, printers, and scanners. 

Characters: Me, User, background second user 

Two users came in and one came up to the desk. 

User: hi, do you have a copy machine we could use? 

Me: I'm sorry, we don't have a copy machine; but we have a scanner and printer so you can scan in your item and print it. 

User: ok

Replacement required,"The recent post about Screwdriver Karen made me remember a story from the beginning of my career.

There was this one (low level) coworker who adamantly refused to change the ink cartridges in his printer because “he wasn’t qualified” (I‘m sure he just couldn’t be bothered). His colleagues had tried to show him but to no avail.

When management learned about this, they ordered me to train him and to „make it really official“, so I actually set a date, gave the guy a detailed step-by-step tutorial about ink cartridge replacement, let him change a few himself and then had him sign the official training form acknowledging he’d received and understood the instructions.

That’s one hour I‘ll never get back.",1207,0,1
"User doesn't doesn't have the ""necessary knowledge"" to open a door","Background: I used to be an on-site tech support guy along with a coworker and our supervisor/manager, the following interaction happened the Monday after a weekend floor re-structuring (teams were rearranged and people moved to different desks).

(Number as the user)

(DF as Supervisor/Manager)

Number : Hi guys, my mouse cable is way to short, I can't move it comfortably.

Me : OK, it must have been pinched or stuck by something in the cable tray under the desk, can you tell us you ID so we can go by your desk when we are free?

As a side note we were on the middle of migrating people from tower PCs to laptops, so we had everyone in the office that qualified, schedule a time for us to do the backup and walk them through the initial set up for the laptop. We were swamped, we couldn't have any delays on migrating anyone because it would've caused a chain reaction with the rest of the appointments we had that day.

Number : Can't it be now? I can use the mouse but its annoying...

DF : We can't right now, but as soon as one of us finishes an appointment early or we take our break, we'll swing by and give you a hand.

Number : (In the best Karen attitude) I needed now!!

DF : we can't help you right now as I already told.

Number : Coooooommmmeee on guys, I need it!!, I need it!!...

My coworker (standing up with a screwdriver in hand): Here you go, just bellow you desk there's one screw if you loosen it you will be able to pull the cable more, that's the best we can do right now.

(Number leaves visibly annoyed)

Her following response was an obvious:

I want to appear like I tried and keep bugging them until they just give up and come to help me

But even with her bugging us we could continue the work, leaving the office meant dealing with any stupid issue that anyone in the path to her desk had, as as soon as we leave the office every lazy number will take advantage off it and just bother us instead of calling help desk.

Number (coming back no 5 mins later): **I don't have the necessary knowledge to use a screwdriver.**

US (In complete shock for what we just heard): what??

Number : yeah, I need your help.

DF : You can't have it right now, the screwdriver is the only technician you'll have helping you at the moment, please let us keep working.

(Number leaves without the screwdriver and we start laughing and chatting about this)

How can you use that phrase, you can't use a screwdriver?? have you never used a knob in you life??.

We are 99% percent sure she just tried that to see if we would give up, but still, if you were already in your desk with the screwdriver, couldn't you just do it instead of coming back to continue bitching??

At the end of the day we went to her desk and fixed the issue.

**Some clarifications**:

1. DF was also working on the migrations so no one was available.
2. The migration was the top priority as per the instructions we got from our superiors.

**TL;DR:** User claims to don't know how to use a screwdriver to see if we would drop everything and come to her rescue.",949,0,1
Sparky The F***ing Inst Guy Transformation Part 1,"First Post, Suggestions are appreciated, Thanks.

Transformation Part 1

Here’s  a story of, oil, riches and the tedium of wrapping up billion dollar  projects. First thing you should keep in mind in oilfield is avoid the  first 10% of a project and the last 10%. This is where the major fuckups  are made and then dragged from the closet John Carpenters Vampires  style, kicking, screaming and on fire. Second never ask for a layoff.  Third … The Grass is always greener on the next site preferably  Greenfield. ( A greenfield site is brand new construction, has yet to be  commissioned, not yet violated by operators.)

In  the beginning there was the most gravy of contracts (Henceforth  referred to as Project Alpha), Money was made and spent hand over fist  by all. Alpha was partially government funded. I was there a year and a  half, and spent the last couple months winding down the site.

It  was pretty good gig, scratch that, damn good gig. I at the time was  just a lowly blue hat, bottom of the totem pole, first rodeo. Somewhere  along the line my original crew was gutted in a mid project layoff and  some dipshit’s on highs bid to make a “super” crew, the best of the best  of the best, JTF2, Seal Team 6, Captain America, except they left all  the grey matter still on the table after assembly. Basically anyone who  never spoke up if there was a problem or kept better ideas to  themselves, the brainwashed, the braindead. Leaving me in a crew of 3  including myself. Left to our own devices, no one to report to, nothing  expected, the forgotten. This was our first industrial site so knowing  no better we just kept on with what we had originally been tasked with,  put a decent day in, avoided safety meetings, filed zero paperwork, and  generally accomplished more in a day than the old crew of 8. Lies? Not a  chance, it eventually became knowledge to me that this company  expected; once all safety requirements were met, 2 hours of actual work  to be accomplished in a 10 hour day, cut the bullshit out and we were  now 4 to 5 times more efficient. The days flew by for about a week, good  times, until the great eye of Sauron turned upon us, some took notice  of a misfit crew that held a morning brief, never in the same spot, no  lead hand, no foreman, and generally didn’t hang around too long.

Following  day enter El Capitan (General Foreman: GF), I’m taking my turn rattling  off the days bulletin as fast as I can in my best auctioneers voice,  when I get a hearty “MORNING GENTLEMEN” from over my shoulder. Fuck.  Boys we’d been had.

“Mind if I join your morning brief?”

“Sure Thing El Capitan”

These  are the people that know exactly what is going on in their area or  should. Slow it down, read the bulletin like there are those present who  care. Stretch it out. Pull out the crumpled drawings we’ve been working  off of over the last week and hand them out.

GF: “Stop by my office after you task your guys” Looks at my nametag on my hard hat “Sparky\_Fig”

Damn he’s got my name now, should’ve scraped that thing off long ago.

“Wheres That?”

“West side Foremans trailer”

Little  did I know there’s over 50 supervision trailers on the west side,  narrow it down to trade specific, there’s still about 6. Wander trailer  to trailer, asking for El Capitan. Each door leads to another world.

In  one trailer the maw to hell is open, full grown men are bellowing at  each other, office supplies are reaching terminal velocity; someone  desperately fills the coffee machine (packs are ripped open with teeth  in the same manner a medic opens quickclot), a blood ritual to appease  the gods. I think someone didn’t refill the copier, I’m berated for  interrupting and stealing the hole punch. He’s not here.

Another  door, the stairs leading up to it reverberate with the roar of  laughter, company computers are tapped into parts of the interweb where  none should ever go. The coffee machine gurgles forth a thick nectar of  caffeinated ecstasy, all mugs are full, their owners sated. I’m berated  for interrupting this important use of company time and whoever the fuck  you’re looking for, He’s not here.

Another  door, ghost town, I’m berated by a non-standard company issued rodent  for leaving the coffee machine on and the fridge door closed. He’s not  here

Fly-a-wall not Firewall,"Disclaimer: this tale does not contain any IT elements, but is definitely a support tale, so please give me the benefit of doubt, because it mentions that mythical place called outside.
As I have explained in my previous posts, I am part of a big company that builds and maintains lots of $BigExpensiveParts. Think of these $BigExpensinveParts as being best described as big metal boxes (think shipping containers) filled with electronics at many various locations spread around the country. The electronics feed back signals to a blinkenlights control panel in an office in a place that you have probably never heard of. If a blinkenlight goes out a technician is dispatched (level 1 support) , then if the technician utters swear words due to an unusual situation a $troubleshooter like myself is called (think level 2 support).

Situation
we have a $BigExpensivePart that is located at the far end of a dirt track, and alongside the length of the track is / was a big brick wall. And when I say big I mean that it was nearly a mile long and the ground level on the opposite side was 6m or 20 foot higher than the dirt track. Also the opposite side of the wall formed the rear of gardens of a lot of very expensive houses.

A few months ago one of the technicians was on site performing routine maintenance work to the $BigExpensivePart and noticed that the top of the wall was leaning over a bit, and so mentioned it in his maintenance report.

When the report got to me, I decided to do a little bit of digging through the records, as we are required to have a SLA for the $BigExpensiveParts, and many tonnes of wall collapsing on top of one would seriously impact uptime.

If this was a movie this bit is where there would be a fast forward montage to skip through all of the boring meetings. The outcome of the meeting was:
Legal had confirmed that the land $BigExpensivePart, the trackway land and the retaining wall were owned by us and so were ours to maintain.
The wall was so old that it was built before the building codes for this size of structure were written, (I suspect that the signature on  the original contract might have been a dinosaur’s footprint, it was that old).
Access to the face of the wall up against the gardens had not been seen for more than 20 years.
There had been many attempts to gain access to the gardens over the years, by various staff members ringing doorbells and posting letters, always mostly unsuccessfully.

I was mulling over what to do about the risk to the $BigExpensivePart when an office based colleague walked past and showed me the latest issue of the internal company newsletter / mini magazine, which is usually so boring that I struggle to get to the end without falling asleep, but this issue had an article that the passing colleague was grumbling at. The colleague was grumbling that the execs had bought a helicopter instead of giving bigger annual bonuses to the staff.

Upon hearing the word “helicopter” I cracked an evil grin so wide that the edges of my mouth nearly joined round the back of my neck, and came up with a cunning plan.

So I filled in the forms to requisition the helicopter, with the explanation that looking at the wall was safety critical, and the letters were not working, climbing over the fences and walls could mistake us for burglars, a drone could not be used as it could not be retrieved if it crashed, so using a low flying helicopter is the only option.

Again, if this were a move, this part is where you can all nip out and get a drink, because there were lots of boring justification, health and safety, costing and other meetings that were so boring that I must have blanked out due to trauma. Anyway the outcome was that I had been granted 2 days use of the company helicopter to examine this wall.

I initially had “surprised face” that they granted me it, immediately followed by an “oh no” moment, about how was I going to do this, as this wall and $BigExpensivePart were a day’s drive from me. Luckily I knew that 2 technicians lived within half an hours drive from the closest airport.

So I set up a conference call with the 2 technicians, myself, my boss and a few hangers on.
The call went something a bit like this:
&gt;OK gents, I have whittled down the contestants and you 2 are the finalists to win a special assignment, which is to perv and take photos in the gardens of expensive houses possibly owned by celebrities, using the company helicopter, To win your place on this assignment you just have to tell me the quickest: (pausing for dramatic effect) as many lyrics as you can to the song Wrecking Ball by Myley Cyrus.

I am sure that the other people on the call thought that I had gone mad. But I had a secret plan.
Anyway technician ‘A’ actually started singing, which caused me to laugh so he won.

From those earlier mentioned boring meetings, I discovered that the law where this took place says,  the minimum cruising height of a helicopter is 500 feet over rural areas and 1000 feet over urban areas, so there was concern about the quality of the photos that could be obtained. 

I had a sneaky idea to make the helicopter fly at 1000 feet and dangle technician from a rope so that he could get a better angle and so improved photos. Alas that bit never happened – damn pesky health and safety. /S

The flight took place with the technician inside the helicopter and many cameras were used (some internal and some externally mounted).

Afterwards, analysis of the photos showed that the images of the wall were too poor quality to accurately determine how poor condition the garden face of the wall was. So we will have to keep trying the old-fashioned posting letters and knocking on front doors method of trying to gain access

in the mean time I just have to pray that the wall does not collapse in my lifetime otherwise, I know that I will receive a call at an inappropriate time to crawl over a pile of rubble that used to be the wall to try and get the $BigExpensivePart up and running or replaced while being shouted at by management about system down time.",267,0,1
"This is Tech Support, not the IT-Department","Hey guys, it's been a while since I posted anything on here, but this happened a few days ago and I thought I'd vent a little.

I work at a support hotline of a medium-sized company. Usually my tasks revolve around checking on customers who went offline and responding to technicians who ran out of ideas on how to fix an issue. This time however, I received a message from HR. Let me recap the chat that ensued:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;HR-Lady: Hi, I'm Karen (not the real name) I'm new around here and just got my Notebook for work, but it is still missing some software I need. Could you help me?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Hi Karen. I'm sorry, but I can't. You might want to talk to Anthony about this. He's the head of the IT-Department.  
&gt;  
&gt;HR: Anthony is on vacation. He left a note that all IT problems should be taken care of by you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Does the Note say ""Jimmy"" by any chance? Because there's a Jimmy Neutron working in IT. I'm Jimmy Hendricks. I work in tech support.  
&gt;  
&gt;HR: Yes, and I need tech support right now!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: That may be, but to install the software you require, you need someone with administration rights. I'm just working a student job right here. I certainly won't be able to help you in this case.  
&gt;  
&gt;HR: That's stupid. Why do you even work in IT, if you don't have administration rights?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I work in tech support. It's an entirely different department from IT.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point she stopped sending messages and I thought I had gotten rid of her. However, she must have been busy in that time to find out my direct dial number, because I got a call from her minutes later. Luckily, I was smart enough to activate the record function before taking the call.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Me: This is Jimmy Hendricks, how may I help?  
&gt;  
&gt;HR: This is Karen. I still need that software for my Laptop!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Hi Karen. Have you tried contacting Jimmy Neutron yet?  
&gt;  
&gt;HR: No I have not. I want YOU to help me now!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Sorry, I can't. As I've said, I don't have admin rights, so I can't install your software. Only the guys in IT may help you in that regard.  
&gt;  
&gt;HR: But you are from tech support. Isn't that the same?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: No, it's not. tech supprt takes care of customer issues. Everything internal is handled by IT.  
&gt;  
&gt;HR: But I want this software installed NOW!  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: It would be best if you contacted Jimmy Neutron then. His direct dial is 123.  
&gt;  
&gt;HR: FINE. But this is not over! You wasted my time!

&amp;#x200B;

She hung up and contrary to her final statement, I actually thought it to be over and went back to work. About an hour later, I was called by the head of HR (Luckily, a sensible person)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;HR-Head: Hey, Jimmy. Karen just complained about you wasting her time. Do you know what's up with that? I don't want to contact Steve (Head of tech support) about this.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Well, she contacted me, about software she needed installed and I explained to her, to contact Jimmy Neutron regarding this issue, but she wouldn't listen.  
&gt;  
&gt;HRH: Well, she said you lead her to believe you could help her.  
&gt;  
&gt;&lt;At this point I sent her a message with a screenshot from my chat with Karen and the recording of her phone call&gt;    
  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I've just sent you evidence that I did nothing of the sort.  
&gt;  
&gt;HRH: *-taking some time to go through it-* Well, that looks indeed like a different story entirely. I'll talk to Karen about this, don't worry.

I haven't heard from Karen since then, but I'll be sure to give an update, if anything happens.

**Edit**: Since I didn't clarify this and some people were asking: I work at customer support at a company that provides Wi-Fi for other businesses. That's why support and IT are separate departments.

**Update**: Yesterday we were informed, that Karen was fired. The decision took a while, because our boss was quarantine (he had close contact to a Corona case, but didn't show any symptoms) Apparently, she still blames me.",1911,0,1

Can't even understand Ctrl+C/V,"Background:

A few years ago I used to work for one of the Big Four Accounting companies as an on-site tech support along with another guy and our supervisor, company decided to open a new office and I was transferred there as someone with experience to train the new guys hired for that location. After a few months, we've been sharing stories with the other office of how dumb the numbers (the way we called users) were in the new office.

The first day that my coworker from the main office visited I had the following interaction with the manager of one of the departments, I had already shared a lot of stories about this manager with him as she was the dumbest person I've ever or will ever meet:

(Number as the manager)

Number : RasT110e5 I want to know how to move text from window to window

Me ( not surprised ): OK, I don't really know what you mean, but can you show me what you are trying to do?

Number : Yes, I've seen my team do it but I don't quite understand how, because they don't use the mouse..., (proceeds to show me that she basically wanted to copy and paste text)

Me : Ohhh ok (understanding that shortcuts are not well known by everyone and that she might be a MacOs user), you need to drag the mouse over the text like so, then press Ctrl and while pressing also press 'C', the- (cuts me off)

Number : Nothing happened....

My coworker (looking at me covering his face with the monitor so only I can see him): (contains laughter)

Me : Yeah, this is just the first step, now you nee- (cuts me off)

Number : This is so hard, isn't there an easiest way???

Me : No, there is no shorter way that 2 commands, as you need to select where to paste the text you just copied.

Number (not convinced): ok...

Me : After you've done step 1 you need to go to where you want to paste the text, click on the text editor of that application and then while pressing Ctrl press 'V'

Number (surprised like the first human being to discover fire): YEAH YEAH that's what I wanted, do it again.

Me : (explain the ""process again"") and (ask her to do it a couple of times)

Number : great, thanks. (leaves our office)

My coworker was in disbelief on how someone can be this detached with technology and manage more that 10 people for a department that oversees the action of potentially any department in the company, but well, we laugh it of and continue with our day.

Not 5 mins later we get a knock on the door and, she again. It took all of my control to not laugh to death upon the first thing that came out of her mouth...

Number : What came after Ctrl???

My coworker (again covering himself against the monitor): (starts looking at me like somehow this person is stealing IQ points from everyone around her)

Me: Number come here, sit with me, we will go over the process again until its clear.

Number : How come there's not an easier way?? you IT guys always make it so hard for the normal people.

Me : \*exhale\*...

Me : (I explain the process around 5 times and write a post it note with the 2 shortcuts and in which order to use them)

After she finally leaves the office I let go and start laughing uncontrollably hard and my coworker had the biggest face of disgust that is humanly possible to do.

For me it was just another funny story of someone that just didn't get technology, but my coworker took it personal, and later on when I left the company and he replaced me in that office as the one with more experience, he took it upon himself to get rid of this manager, but that's a different story.

TL;DR: Manager didn't know that copy and paste existed since 1973 and blames us for it.

**EDIT**

There are a lot of comments of why didn't I just teach her with the right click method, I didn't because this particular company has tons of proprietary software which overrides the right click options for specific business logic options, and I didn't want to have that dreaded but completely foreseeable call ""RasT110e5 this program broke my copy paste... I need this fix now!!!""

“It says locked!”,"I work internal tech support (calls and chats) for a large company. I got this call tonight:

Me: Tech support this is LaterallyHitler, how can I help you?

User: I changed my password on Friday, and my account is locked.

Me: *checks account status* I see that it’s not locked.

User: But it says locked at the top!

Me: *facepalm*

Me: That’s the lock screen, it doesn’t mean your account is locked. You should be able to just login.

User: I tried that earlier and it didn’t work!

Me: *thinking it could be a credential caching issue considering the recent password change* Try your old password.

User: That didn’t work either, I’ll try my new one again.

We are not the power company.,"This took place in early-mid 2018. I work for a company that outsources tech support to other companies. Before my promotion I was in the department contracted out a particular ISP central division for their Wireless Gateway tier 2 Department (before it all became just tier and at the time we were taking regular calls on top of escalation calls). I get a call from a woman and this is how it goes (Note: Cx = customer):

Me: Thank you for choosing ISP, how may I help you?

Cx: My internet aint workin'.

Me: I'm very sorry to hear that, let me just pull up your acc- (cuts me off)

Cx: There's no power.

Me: ...I'm sorry? There's no power?

Cx: Yeah, in the building.

Me: (pauses for a stretch of time as my mind is trying to grasp stupidity) o-okay....  
Cx: There's now power. (said a little more loudly)

Me: ....Right. (pauses again) You need power for it to work.

At this point the caller went quiet and I could hear her muttering to someone in the background ""it needs power for it to work.""

Cx: Well there ain't no power! -she exclaimed loudly.

Me: ...right. You need power for for your internet to work.

Cx: The buildin' got no power.

At this point my headache was growing as I found myself caught in a loop. After an awkward pause I finally respond again.

Me: Right... we are an ISP. You need to call the power company for this.

I hear her again mutter to someone in the background ""we need to call the power company for this.""

Cx: But we pay you.

Me: Right. You pay us for your internet; not for power. Internet needs power to run. You will have to call your power company.

Cx: (after a brief pause) Okay.

After that the call immediately disconnected. To this day, despite all the idiocy I deal with day-in and day-out, calling and ISP for a building-wide power outage is still something I cannot wrap my head around.",1043,0,1
"There are bodies, man!","This happened around 2011-2012 when I worked tech support for a major telecom company.

""Hello, thank you for calling Company, this is-""

""Man you gotta help me get this phone working, man, it's life or death""

At this point I should note that he was calling in from the line on an account that I'm assuming, but not entirely sure, was his.

""Ok, let's get you fixed up. Can you verify the name on your account?""

""Man we don't have time, this an emergency!""

At this point I decide to just start with basic hardware troubleshooting since I don't have to verify anything for that. ""I understand this may be urgent, what's the issue?""

""You gotta help, man, there are bodies! Bodies, man!""

I pause for several seconds, replaying that in my head and confirming that yes, he did in fact say there are bodies.

""Sir, what's the issue with the phone?""

""Oh fuck, I gotta go."" -click-

Never did find out what was wrong with the phone.",1434,0,1
One of the funnier ways someone has asked me for help,"So I work in the IT Department for a school district and lately a lot of our work has been remote, but I still go in for a few hours on some days if I have a reason to. Today happened to be one of those days. I was getting in my car so I could drive to a different school and off in the distance I heard a car horn honk twice followed by an engine revving. I looked over and I see one of our maintenance trucks barreling towards me.

The truck veered into the line of empty parking spots I was parked in and was now driving directly at me. A few yards from my car, he turned and stopped on a diagonal with his driver's side facing me and just said ""Hey whenever you get a minute can you go to the maintenance barn and look at the computers? One of them completely froze up on me yesterday.""

This was a nice twist on the typical ""While you're here..."" requests, or somebody stopping me in the hallway. I can honestly say this was the first time someone has driven a vehicle at me to ask for help. I found it amusing, I hope you all did too.",1107,0,1
"A support tale from the camera truck, or Why aren't the new batteries taking a charge.","I get a call from one of our production crews that is at a nearby location. They are using our in house camera gear and have a bunch of the new battery packs I built.

The original packs were so poorly made I was surprised they even worked. The first time I opened one I found spliced wires that did not need splices. A 12"" wire from a relay to a battery had 3 segments of wire spliced together. Upon examination of others I revealed the same splices and weird wiring. When I spoke to the manufacturer it was learned that the people who made them just copied the prototype EXACTLY with no understanding of how anything worked.

The reason I got into this was because a couple of packs had failed and one had gone Three Mile Island.  These were 28V 4000mAH nicad batteries. If they shorted they could really make a mess and sometimes a fire. The shorts were coming from little trims or wire that had dropped into the case when the cloners were making them.

The issue they had was the batteries were not charging overnight. They would plug them all in  at the end of the day, close up the camera trailer and then go home. The next morning they would come in and the batteries would be sitting there with their charge lights on. When they started using them the ones fresh off the charge would fail in half an hour instead of the 4 to 6 hours they should run. If the got one that had been sitting still on charge in the trailer for the morning it would last longer.

Batteries were sent back to me for testing and all tested fine. I charged them overnight in my charging bay and they had a full charge the next morning.

Let me tell you about the charging bay... Because of the TMI experience I had a new rack built to charge batteries. It had a big relay that controlled the 2 20A circuits for charging batteries. That had 2 Big Buttons for **Power On** and **Kill Power Now**. There was also a smoke detector for unattended operation of the **KPN** function. If the power went out a human had to push the Power On button once power was restored, just to make sure nothing was amiss when power was applied. When there are a few thousand watt hours of batteries there you don't want any unexpected things to happen.

After a week of this back and forth I went and visited the location. I examined the charging setup in the camera trailer and found they were plugging in 12 battery packs to a single 15A line that was run to the trailer. This also ran the lights in the truck.  I looked at this and got curious how it was working at all. These packs draw about 2.5 amps each to charge.  The nerds out there will know that 12 devices drawing 2.5A is 30 amps. The thing is though the pack ramps up the charge current and it starts around an amp and takes about 30 min to get up to full steam. More than enough time to make a hasty retreat.

I then had a chat with the Teamster who managed the camera truck and trailer. When questioned he told me that when he came in in the morning he would fine the power for the trailer was out. The breaker would trip. Being the good Teamster and taking care of his camera crew he would reset the breaker so the power and lights would be on when the crew arrived. He never mentioned it to anyone.

I did some re-education of the camera team and got them into a different overnight power regimen and all was well in the world.

Teal Deer: Batteries were tripping the breaker, but it was being reset before anyone noticed what was wrong. And sometimes you have to make a house call to see for yourself.",345,0,1
Robots not completing tasks,"For context, I'm not a support tech but work in Robotics at my company, where we roll out digital robots to automate company operations ranging from cust. care to finance to back office operations.

I usually arrive late at work (11-11.30a) but at 10.30a my phone went off and my boss needs me in the office asap, so I go. I arrive and go to the room where my teammates are already present losing their shit dealing with tens of departments (credit ops, back office ops, care, finance, delivery, accounts, etc.). Some 70-80 of our 250+ bots are down and so hundreds of transactions are stacking up by the minute which people have to fulfill manually, although we don't have the capacity because the company has been firing ppl ever since we came in and started automating everything.

No one can figure out what's going on.... We try to remote in and the VMs are up and running. Director is already on alert, we're trying to troubleshoot, automation scripts are still there, nothing wrong with run/build time scripts. All 4 of us (useful teammates) + robot controller (someone promoted from support and handed to us) + my manager (knows nothing about our automation) are trying to troubleshoot. Soon the VP is on alert from all the pissed process owners (and their bosses). For hours we're trying to reboot machines, reconfigure and reinstall scripts, but nothing. We alert IT but they're no help and are confused and clueless too.

I was getting my 10th cup of coffee, furious and confused. Decided to call the data center (owned by the company, outside the city), described what was happening, asked them to physically locate the VMs assigned to us, and reboot those mainframes as the last resort I could think of (none of us are networking/hardware guys). A data center tech goes to the physical server and notices the internet wire disconnected from the back, they checked the surveillance cams and turns out a cleaner was cleaning the floor and mopped aggressively in the back causing the wire to disconnect. But since the computers were all on site, they still appeared on the LAN 🤦‍♂️",671,0,1
Mom has her own logic :-),"For context I'm not a support technician but since i work in computer science, i made some support for my familly. And English is not my native language, sorry for any mistakes.

My brother and I gave our mother a laptop computer for christmass. She is a lot reluctant to new technolgies, but we decided that she needed to learn how to use a computer. We showed her how to look at her bank accounts , how to use video replay,... So basically she only uses the web browser and do not know how internet works (internet provider, modem, wifi...)

One day she was leaving for her secondary house which do not have internet connection.

I asked her why she took the computer. She replied to me that internet will work by there. I told her no. She insisted. I asked why she thinks it will work : she told me that internet is comming in her computer through SATELLITE. I started to smile.  I tried to explain that no, it's comming trough the wifi. She told me no the computer IS receving internet with satellite. I asked why she thought that her computer was satellite ""enabled"".

And ho boy, i didn't see that coming. She opened her computer, start it and show me victoriously  the satellite logo turning on. See?

We gave her a ""toshiba satellite"" laptop model.

I could not help but laught.I  had to apologize, telling her that it was her disarming logic that took me by surprise.

PS: Here is the logo that she though was satellite reception: [Logo](https://ibb.co/z5sBNhm) It does turn on with the laptop.

Major issue! Offbroad call center IT can't just check basic stuf....,"I worked some years Ago for an internet provider.

I was support level 3 on the  app that callcenters used to create tickets from end users calls.

Some callcenter where in house, in the provider country, some where in foreign countries with specialised callcenters company.

One morning i got escalated by a call center telling me that my app was not working.

I checked my monitoring tools. Everything was fine.

I told Lvl2 to ask if they troubleshout basic stuff on their side. ""yes of course""

Some time later i got 3 ou 4 call centers escalating with random problems.

I started to see less activity (The numbers of ticket are whithin 10% of comparable days. Mondays with mondays, wednesdays whith wednesday,...).

Somthing should be wrong. So i started a crisis conf call and took the lead. We asked to network to check offsite proxies, firewall,... Everything between them and my servers. We found nothing. 

Users who had the problem started to be abble to work again but users not affected started to have the issue... Random problem. GREAT.

After some hours i got bored and was taking my ""personnal browsing time"" on some computers news websites while listening the call.

After few minutes i found a very interesting article : Kaspersky update disrupt internet connectivity of computers. Forced update can solve the issue.

I unmute my microphone and said : Can you asked end users if the can acess to usual website?

Call centers : google is not reachable, microsoft... Intranet is not working. 

Me (mute): WTF. Facepalm. 

Me (unmute) : SO your are making me manage a crisis call but you are not able to check if you computers can browse?  Seriously? Our app is a lightweight app. It works in the browser. So if you can't browse you can't use it.

Call centers :  dead silence...

Me: Tell me Call centers? Is your antivirus Kaspersky?  (Kaspersky was not internal antivirus).

Call centers : Yes. Why?

Me :  Check with YOUR internal IT services.  Your antivirus software updates kill browsing and your IT team is, I think, pushing the new updates to solve it. It explains the randomness or waves your are seeing.  Have you checked with your local admins ou IT before escalading us?

Call centers: Oooops.....

I issued a return of experience note saying: Lvl1 or at least Lvl2 MUST check with call centers that  basic stuff like browsing is working BEFORE escalating a critical issue on my apps.

If i did not take time for personnal browsing, i think i might still be on this call.",169,0,1
Customer whines about part- wants management," 

BACKSTORY: Every hour of the day of my job- customers ask for free or discounted parts for their fitness equipment. I've posted before- so here's another incident that happened just today (by the way I troubleshoot/sell parts to customers for out of warranty tech support for a large fitness equipment co)

Y'all it's hard to just not end up a grinch and never give anyone anything for free- or conversely hard to not give in every time someone bitches/moans... However- we have an IN-warranty and an OUT of warranty tech support team. I am OOW. If I worked on both teams- it'd be a different story. Also- I work partially off commission- so if I give everything away for free I don't make as much and so my student loans and car sits- longer to pay off.

I typically cut customers a deal: if they

A) are nice/respectful/don't insult me or the company and they don't whine

B) If really want to fix their machine RIGHT- and need to buy a few parts- since I have faith in that they're fixing it up good not just putting a bandage on it- I'll give them often wholesale cost if they get a few things... But then you have customer's asking for the bandage-part-ala-carte...and if part breaks again then they're mad so we just offer ""bandage parts'' at full cost- no budging. Since it's electronic- not fixing ROOT of issue- and I try to be fair/courteous whenever possible......but some things def won't get me to budge lol

 STORY:

Annoying lady: *Hi I'm calling because I'm \[insert long sob story about how she is 50 yrs old and hasn't even used this equipment for 10 hrs total even though it's been sitting for 10 yrs and now she's starting her ""journey"" again and our equipment we should stand behind and she already paid someone 100 dollars to come tell her that she needs a replacement part]...so yea my machine is...* 

(You read that right, she doesn't even ask me a question about anything in particular just trails off about her life..something about what someone local told her but nothing directly she's even asked)

Me: (unsure of what to say and realizing she's prolly a choosy beggar) 
*I'm sorry to hear that- well sounds like you've already narrowed it down to what you need- someone diagnosed it for you already is that right?*

Annoying lady: *well yes I' mean uh uh I'm just trying to say that I think your company should stand behind your product and I - I - I just don't know why this would break already. I've only used this 5 hrs total!! (before she said 10) - and I just I just -don't understand*

Me: (starting to get irritated at her lack of actually asking for something besides rambling outright- tryin to refocus)  
*ok- so step one is - do you have your serial #? And did the local tech tell you whether it's the LOWER or UPPER board you need? These rarely go out unless there is a power surge, or there's lack of maintenance so board draws high amperage, shorts out...of course t here are things inexplicably that can happen..what symptoms did you have if any leading up to board shorting out?*

AL: **climbs mount Everest in background- complaining about how she has to get on her hands and knees to get even the MODEL # for me..of course can't get down to ground enough to find Serial** *well I see from this guy's notes that came here I need the LOWER control board- ok - see I see here my receipt- It shows {several years ago's date)*

Me: *Ok well I am sorry to say but your parts warranty was only 1 yrs- you are several years past the warranty- it sounds like you need a part- would you like me to get you a quote?*

AL: *Well well - I - I - I just don't think I should have to pay for this!!! I have seriously only used this 5 years. Can't you P-leasaaaaase just understand me in MY shoes! This is a D-E-F-E-C-T!!!*

Me: *well I am sorry maam- I do understand- however at the end of the day- this is the place to purchase parts- that's my job. Now if you want to troubleshoot a bit more- I can tell you the part typically doesn't go out unless it's either bumped, damaged- or there's a power surge. It'd be very rare for this part to fail unless under-maintained. Now of course some things happen in life that are inexplicable- however even if it is a defect, that would have been covered in the first year- which is why that warranty is in place- typically we would have discovered defect right away. I can't guess as to how your board blew out unfortunately unless we troubleshoot more. Now would you like me to get you a quote?*

AL: *What's your name!! I - I - I thinkkk that if you will not give me part for free- then I will have to escalate this. I don't want to but I'm going to have to. Now- I think I'd like you to get me to a manager*

(my manager first of all RARELY is available- we don't have a team lead. Me and the 2 guys I work with pretty much tell people no when they ask for management- because mgmt lets us basically be our own boss- as firm as we need to be- and certainly handing out discounts is not something we ever HAVE to do- only if we WANT TO- And just as long as we're firm and polite- he doesn't care if we just enforce policy.)

Me: *I am sorry no manager is available. This is policy. Is there anything else regarding your machine you had a question about?*

AL: *Get me to a manager*


Me: *""sorry none is available, and management won't speak to you about something like this. If you need to order a part just callback here or visit ....dotcom. Have a great day""*

Disconnected call- 

This lady didn't even hear price of part and wantwd a manager. I do like that I am authorized to stand my ground and policy and my manager has trained me to act as my own manager. 
You can cry and whine all you want but reality is, businesses are not run like they used to where ""customer is always right""

By the way I have been on phones for 5 to 6 yrs. Started out doing census work for govt. To working for GE parts. To now working for a fitness company that is international. I may be a lil harsher in my delivery and less kissing up to customers as some people may be allowed to be- but I am thankful for a lil more lax work environment as nothing is worse than not being able to be firm with customers or having leeway to put them in place/re-focus topics. I am sure this call I may get a bit of a talking to but as of now since my department is facing an 800% increase in calls past 2 mos with covid- my company can't really fire me lol knock on wood

EDIT: To add ending I missed/formatting
Also this is the second post- deleted my first post as in title I wrote whine spelled like the beverage,  and couldn't live with myself",108,0,1
"""So there's nothing you can do? :(""","Another story from my web hosting days.  

This time I was working the evening shift and it was a quiet night.  I took the opportunity to get a few tickets out of the way and manage other tasks when I notice an alert pop up on the monitoring board.  It's showing a massive sudden increase in traffic - not DDoS level, but still concerning.  At about the same time an alert pops up for one of our shared servers:  high load, connectivity issues, other services not responding.  The amount of traffic wasn't concerning as such, it was just unusual, unexpected and sudden.

I give it a few minutes to settle down in case it's a temporary thing, but notice the traffic is increasing.  So I call the on-call tech and ask him to investigate.  He's driving home from the shops, but will be on in about five minutes to investigate it further.

Then I get a call from a customer.

Customer: ""Hi there, I hope you can help me.  My website is offline and it's a really bad time, please help!""

Me: ""No problems, let's take a look, what's your website?""

The customer gives me all the information and I take a look.  It's on the same server with the alert.

Me: ""Righto, it looks like your site is down as we're seeing a huge amount of inbound traffic and--""

Customer: ""Yeah, I think that's me.  I was contracted to work on $realityTVshow and that episode just aired tonight. They put my website on the screen just before and everyone's trying to visit my site"".

It turns out this customer was a tradie of some kind and had indeed worked on some shitty but immensely popular reality TV show.  One where people compete against each other to renovate a house or garden or some nonsense (I dunno, I don't watch the stupid things).

At this point the tech was online and had confirmed it:  there was a huge amount of traffic inbound, all trying to reach this guy's website.

Me: ""Ok, we can see what's happening.  It looks like viewers of this show are trying to load your website.  Unfortunately there's simply too many requests simultaneously and the shared server you're on can't deal with that.  That's why there's an error"".

Customer: ""Oh. So there's nothing you can do?""

Me: ""No, sorry.  We can increase the resources allocated temporarily, but that's not really going to make a difference given the amount of traffic.  Honestly, if we knew about this in advance we would've happily sorted something out for you"".

I could tell this guy was upset, but he was still remarkably calm.  He even apologised to us for causing trouble.  A quick chat to the tech and we hobbled together a shitty but workable solution: visitors would see a ""Sorry, too much traffic - try again later!"" page for his site rather than the error.  Not great, but better than nothing.

The call ended after that and I'm pretty sure I heard the guy crying.  Given the situation I was surprised we didn't cop abuse from him, and I was even more surprised when he sent feedback thanking us for doing all we could.  He understood there was little we could do, and even asked us to help him plan for this in the future.  

It was one customer I genuinely felt bad for.",568,0,1
"Users don't bother to read emails about downtime , waste a maintenance window.","This is a rant . Happened just now so venting out the frustration on Reddit.

I work for Application support in a fairly large healthcare company. Our clients are hospitals which treat the most dreadful disease out there. So one of such hospitals have an application issue so we asked the customer yesterday for downtime . The primary contact for this site gave us 6 PM- 7PM today as the approved window. Having had some wisdom from working for long in IT support, I proactively asked the primary contact to  if there are any additional people\\ email distros to be notified of this downtime and asked her to include them in the communication. She did add a couple of email DL and physicists.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today 6 PM, I send out a mail notifying the start of maintenance and log in to their systems . Lo and behold , I see many users still active and working on the system. I think to myself, they must be wrapping up their work and logging off, let's give them 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, instead of users logging off, the number of users has gone up. 

I send out another mail informing that I am still seeing active users on the systems. How long I have to wait before I can start working? This mail seemed to have dropped like a stone in a puddle  because I see a hurried reply from one of the users asking two other users 'I just read the following mail. Who was working yesterday when we were notified that $ITsupport would be working on the system'. Apparently nobody else apart from the primary contact had bothered to read emails and were blissfully unaware of any activity that was scheduled today.

Mind you, the end users of this systems are senior physicists with Masters and PhDs . 

The maintenance today is cancelled and we have to get a new window now. So much for advance notification . Why don't people read their mails??",1354,0,1

I got a call from a customer, that got is pc 3 weeks prior, and as called co many times with issues or questions, that have little to do with the hardware itself, but mostly with due to is configurations and choices.

Because of the, my colleague as started to give some responses, that are not so polite, but justified, and due to this, the customer requested that he does not receive support from him, again, so this time was my turn.

Me = me; hardtech = wannabe hardware technician or customer;

ME: I this is me, from abc, what can I help you with.

Hardtech: Hi, **I’m a hardware technician in a professional school…** The front audio connectors on the computer that you sold me, don’t work.

ME: Ok, can you tell me in which port you are connecting the jack, and what type headphones you are using? I’m asking th…(interrupts, but my explanation was valid, since the pc had 1 combo (headphone/mic port and a headphone port, and many people mistake them)

Hardtech: Men, **I’m a hardware technician in a professional school**, so I understand of computers, we can talk technically, and of course that I connected to the correct port.

Me: ok…, and the audio volume is correct when you connect it’ since the drivers use different volumes for both front and rear jacks?

Hardtech: Yes, the volume is ok.

Me: and if you connect to the rear jack, it works correctly?

Hardtech: yes, they work correctly.

Me: (I doubt the answers, but what can I do?) ok, since this brand as showed some issues with drivers for this OS version, have you tried accessing the brand website and download an older driver version?

Hardtech: no, where can I do that?

Me: You can go to the brand web site and search for “pro pc 6000 scc”

Hardtech: where can I search that? I can’t find the search bar…

Me: (hardware tech my a..) Then google it, it should be the first result.

Hardtech: I’m using google, chrome**, I’m a hardware technician, we can talk more technically**

Me: (internally, if you are a technician, why are you having so much trouble following simple tasks?) not google chrome, google search engine.

Hardtech: oh, ok… found it, but it doesn’t show any drivers available…

Me: IS I told you, please select an older version, to download;

Hardtech: how do I do that? **I’m a hardware technician, we can talk more technically…**

Me: (muting phone, Fuuuu…) You will se 2 links, one with OS selection and one for the version, please select OLD OS, and OLD version.

Hardtech: ok, it shows up, should I download it?

ME: (no, eat it) yes, download it please.

Hardtech: It as finished downloading, should I install it?

Me: (no, cook it with potatoes) Yes, please, and restart the machine after…

Hardtech: Ok… will this take long?

Me: should be fast, 2 or 3 minutes, btw, I need to place you on hold for a second, I need to attend the door, is it ok? (I didn’t, but I needed a break, to bash my head on the table…)

ME: and is the sound working?

Hardtech: no, but you see**, I’m and hardware technician on a school, we can talk more technically.**

Me: Well, the only option is if you RMA the machine to us, so that we can look. We can have a pickup scheduled for tomorrow…

Hardtech: and that will take how long?

Me: 5 business day, minimum, 1 day for the pickup, 1 for it to be delivered to us, 1 for analyses and fix, 1 for sending, and another for it to be delivered to us.

Hardtech: that won’t do, I need it tomorrow and in 3 days again…

Me: ok, you can come o our facilities, and deliver it in hand.

Hardtech: that won’t do as well, I live on “another city”, and I don’t have a car

Me: well, can’t you use the rear audio for now, and send it after?

Hardtech: **I am a hardware technician in School,** and need the pc these days…

Me: but can you use, the rear audio?

Hardtech: No, I need the front ones working.

Me: so, how do you propose we do this?

Hardtech: Don’t know, can you come and fix it here?

ME: No, we can’t do that.

Hardtech: You think I if I reinstall OS, it may work?

ME: Sure, give it a go, and call us after

Hardtech: ok, the key is on the machine, right? I can’t find it, I only see one sticker on the side, with some numbers and letters, but no key…

Me: (screaming inside WTF!!!!) that’s it…

Hardtech: oh, I was about to rip it…

Me: please call us back, if it doesn’t work, good morning…

Hardtech: thanks.

… “2 hours latter” …

Me: Hi, this is me, from abc, how can I help you?

Hardtech: Hi, this is hardtech, **I am a hardware technician in a school, we can talk technically.**

Me: Hi hardtech, we talked this morning, did the reinstall Fix it?

Hardtech: yes, it did… but the computer is very slow

ME: Well, that may be because of updates.

Hardtech: yes, I tough so, so I powered it off, do you think that the updates will be done when I power it on?

ME:(He did not just say that…) you powered it off? The computer?

Hardtech: yes, the computer

ME: it won’t install if it is powered off…

Hardtech: oh, so I should have just powered the screen of then? Will it install if the monitor is off?

ME: (OMG, this is not happening to me, reddit here I go), yes, it will update with the screen off.

Hardtech: thanks, goodbye.

"""Do we have Teens or Sky on our computers?""","First tale here under this pseudonym so I have to be a little more generic than I usually would. I work in IT as an IT Mangler over several sites in the US for a global bioscience/life science company and abroad. One of my sites has live mice in it for ascites collection (that's about as much as I know). This is a really short tale from earlier today that my wife thought was hilarious but could have brought a lesser seasoned ITM to tears; it just made me SMH and smile.          
   
Due to COVID-19 we have been able to work from home a lot, and I took advantage of that today because I have to work in the office tomorrow and Friday. The phone system at my site sends you an email when you have a voicemail but it's usually 10 to 20 minutes before it actually gets to the end user thanks to how our corporate email works (I am not at the corp site, I am in a satellite office but I report directly to the CIO).    
Around 11am today I got 3 voicemails from the ""mouse house"" - a site with over 40,000 live mice for medical tests and research, which is weird because the site manager there usually texts me or emails if there is an issue. I called them back and the head lab lady (heretofore known as NLL bc she's really nice) answered the phone.    
    

Now as an FYI, NLL is a really sweet older lady in her 60's and she has been with the company over 20 years and her job entails of lot of highly specific lab duties with the mice and the ascites so she's definitely not stupid in any way. Yesterday, the site manager had emailed me asking to reset her password (no reason why) and I did. The call....     
     
    
&gt;Me: Hey NLL, what's up? I got 3 voicemails from your site, what's wrong?    

&gt;NLL: I can't get into my email and nothing's working. The temporary password isn't working and it's not taking what I changed it to or the new one!   
    
&gt;Me:  Is your Skype or Teams working so you can share your screen with me?     

&gt;NLL: Hang on a minute. YELLS to someone else ""HEY DO WE HAVE TEENS OR SKY ON OUR COMPUTERS?""    
&gt;NLL: She doesn't know, she thinks we have Sky.
(if you have to ask you don't have / don't use them pretty much)
    
&gt;Me: That's OK NLL, let's try this another way (goes into AD and brings up Notepad because I planned to reset it back to her old password and that would be that until the next time). What was your old one?    


&gt;NLL: Oh this is going to be hard.   

&gt;Me: Just go one character at a time and I will read it back to you as we go    

&gt;NLL: OK...It's the dash with the hyphen next to it.     

&gt;Me: (desperately trying to figure out what what is talking about) It's the what?    

&gt;NLL: Oh I don't know how to describe it!   

&gt;Me: Did you say it was a dash or a hyphen? Let's try this - what key is it next to?    

&gt;NLL: It's the SHIFT button and the number 1    

&gt;Me: Ok that's the exclamation mark.   
   
&gt;NLL: Oh yeah that's it!  
   
**IT WAS THE EXCLAMATION POINT, Y'ALL!!!**    
We made it painfully through the entire password (including her realizing she was literally spelling out her password in front of her coworkers so she went into another room and started whispering to me which made it harder as it is not a quiet site where she is), or so I thought, and I had typed it in notepad as we went along.    
I reset it and went about my day, telling her I had called from my cell and to text me or call me on it if she needed me again.     
    
&gt;12:15 I get a text:       
Not working.    

I text back a picture of the notepad text of her password because I didn't think my wife could handle me calling NLL back.   

I hear nothing back so I sent her a text later and confirmed she was in, yay.     
     
My wife is still laughing and repeating ""DO WE HAVE TEENS OR SKY?""       
    
TL/DR: got a call today from a really sweet user who had no idea if she had Teams or Skype on her computer. Figured out how to help her anyway. :)

If you want it to work pick it up and drop it.,"To set the stage this story happened in the 92 or 93 when I worked for a small software/hardware company specializing in dental office software. This was in the days before the modern laptop and the solution our management had found for our sales force to do onsite demos was a computer all built into the keyboard (picture a 3 inch thick metal keyboard with a VGA port). Our sales teams would ship this modern marvel of portable computing and a CRT monitor to wherever they where doing a demo then go onsite and hook it all up.

I get a call from one of the owners to hurry to their office to help one of our sales people who called with a problem. SP=sales person, Me=me

Me - What going on?

SP - I'm onsite and all setup but when I turn it on I get a message that there is no boot device.

Knowing that these wonderful portable computers had an IDE hard drive that instead of a cable connecting it to the MB sat next to the MB and the pins that normally would be connected to cable where instead just pressed into a female connector directly on the MB. And that the Hard drive wasn't mounted as firmly as it should be. I guessed that the hard drive had moved and was no longer connected to the MB fully. This usually required me to open the case and press down on the drive to seat it properly but I couldn't ask the sales person to bust out a screwdriver and open the case. So I said

Me - pick the computer up six inches off the desk and drop it.

SP- You want me to do what?

Me- Pick it up and drop it.

SP - That's what I thought I heard. I can't do that the entire staff is sitting here watching. 

Me -   If you want it to work pick it up and drop it. 

I hear a thud over the phone as they picked it up and dropped it on the desk and a minute of silence then

SP - Thank you it is working now.",953,0,1
Your app doesn’t work connect,"So part of our product offering is mobile apps that technicians can use in the field to close service calls. 

For like a solid month we had one client complain about certain users never being able to connect the app and work calls while at certain customers. We tested and did code reviews and found no issues to match what they were describing.

Finally, I had one of the techs call me when they had issues and preceded to tell me the app wouldn’t connect but that they went back to the parking lot and it worked fine. 

Ended up finding out that the customer was a hospital and the machine was in the FUCKING basement 2 stories underground. The tech didn’t believe me that data didn’t always connect when underground. So I told him to go down there again and try to load google or Facebook.

Never heard from them again.",148,0,1
Send a tech for diabetic check,"This happened on Christmas Eve 2019. My job allowed the tech support department to only work half a day. 

For clarification, I work for an ISP that has a large number of elderly customers. My company encourages the elderly customers to call for any little thing. I often make a joke that “if you stub your toe, please let (company name) know.”

Me = Me, NL = Nice Lady

On this day I got a call from a nice older lady. I don’t remember the exacting wording, but the conversation went something like this: 

Me: Thank you for calling (company) how can I help you today?

NL: Yes, I was wondering if you can send a technician to my house to help me.

Me: Since it is Christmas Eve, and the field techs will stop working at 11:00, I cannot promise that I can get a technician to your home today. What’s the issue you’re having specifically? 

NL: I’m diabetic and I need someone to check my blood sugar for me. I can’t do it because my fingers get cramped up real easy.

Me: I’m sorry ma’am that is not something our technicians are even allowed to do. Have you tried calling your doctor or the hospital?

NL: My doctor is on vacation. Can you please just send a technician? (Company name) technicians are really nice and I don’t think they would have a problem helping me.

Me: I’m sorry ma’am, I cannot send a technician for that. I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but I can only recommend you contact a medical professional, because our technicians cannot test your blood sugar.

NL: (sounds like she’s starting to cry) Okay.... I don’t know what I’m going to do now. I’m sorry I bothered you. Have a merry Christmas.

Me: I apologize that I’m unable to help you further. I hope you can find someone that can help you. If you have any technical issues, please feel free to call us back. Have a Merry Christmas. 

I felt bad for her, but there was no help I could offer her, other than recommending actual medical personnel.",129,0,1
User needs the best of the best.,"Few years ago,  I was working IT support for a small software company that went through a growth period, during that time they had hired a “marketing/design” person out of California. (The company was in the Midwest.)

I setup a computer for the user to use, normal FruitBook that we had on hand. The user came to the office, did the standard new hire things then a few days later, headed back to California.

The following week, I get an email from the CEO with the CTO and the users CC’ed on it.

This is unacceptable, this new user is a key part in getting the message out on our company, and these specs on the this laptop are not good enough for this user, get a new, more powerful one , setup and shipped out ASAP.

(The laptop was a $3500 FruitBook)

I was a little confused, the user has been here for a week. What could you be doing to need some crazy spec laptop? Being newish at the company, I went to the CTO to get his take.

Me: Did you read that email CEO just sent.

CTO: Yeah that laptop is more than enough to get the job done the user is tasked with.

“Then a smirk flashed on the CTO’s face.”

CTO: You know what, lets get the user a new FruitBook. I feel like shopping.

The CTO proceeds to custom build a new FruitBook with the max performance options, and adds many bells and whistles to it.

New price, a little under $10k.

CTO: There I will email CEO and get the go ahead. (Doubting that the CEO would go for it for that price.)

A little while later, CTO emails me that the laptop is in process and I need to go pick it up, in a few weeks.

Shocked, I go to talk with CTO again.

Me: Really? CEO went for that?

CTO: Yep.

Me: Well, okay then.

Once the new Fruitbook was ready, i picked it up and  set it up, and shipped it out to the user. No more complaints.

The fun of it all is that, with in 3 months the company when on the downward path. The growing company started to shrink again, as people where let go. One of the people let go was the user from California.

We got the FruitBook shipped back to us.

Me: Hey CTO the FruitBook from California is here.

CTO: Okay reset it and give it to me.

Me: “Oh!” Now I get why you had that little smirk when you ordered that laptop.

CTO: Yep, I built it like I was building it for myself, longer wait time, but it’s mine now. Would not want to let the expensive FruitBook go to waste, you know?

Luckily my time at that company was not very long, before I got out of there with ""most"" of my sanity still intact.",757,0,1
Remote user forgets how the Internet works,"Last week I get a text message from one of my co-workers, ""I can't connect to the Remote Desktop server, it keeps saying my connection failed."" So first things first, I have her send me a pic of the error. Sure enough, it's a connection error. I'm currently connected to the remote server she's trying to get to, so I know it's not a server problem. Next step for me is to log into TeamViewer and make sure her computer is even online. Everyone at our company knows that I use TeamViewer to remote into their PCs for tech support, and I've done so previously for this user. I also told her I was going to check TeamViewer to see if I could see her PC online. I check, and it shows her PC is offline, which confirms my suspicion that something is wrong on her end.

The next bit of conversation over texts turns my hair grayer than it already is:

Me: ""It looks like there's something wrong on your end, I don't see you online. You should call your ISP and find out if there's an outage in your area.""
Her: ""Can you connect to my laptop and check my internet connection?""

I don't think I've ever facepalmed so hard in my entire life. Thankfully, since this was over text, she didn't hear me give myself a minor concussion.

In the end, all was well. She ended up realizing that one of her WiFi routers had gotten unplugged, and after plugging it back in she was up and running again.",241,0,1
Our Internet is Slow!,"About  10 years ago or so, I worked for a company that had some sites that  were out of the country. We had one international location that was  shutting down, which means we weren't paying for expensive network  connectivity anymore.  Don't remember if they had DSL, cable or what  after their T1s were removed but it was adequate. That is until we got  an email from the Operations Manager for that site.

He  complained that their network connectivity was extremely slow and  hindering getting work done. I passed this onto one of my guys to  initially look at it. He was able to gain access to this manager's  computer via whatever remote software we used at the time. About 5  minutes after I've passed this off, I get an IM from my guy asking me to  come over to his computer and take a look at what he's found. What do I  need to look at I wonder? How can he need my help with just 5 minutes  of troubleshooting done?

Apparently,  the Operations Manager didn't think that perhaps the P2P sharing of  media (I can't say the type so we'll just call them ""videos"") would slow the site's Internet connection significantly. This  manager had left for a bit as he knew we were on his computer and I  didn't have a cell number to reach him. I asked for the keyboard and  opened up Notepad on the Ops Manager's computer.  My note was something  like ""Are you f'ing kidding me? We are doing no further troubleshooting  while you are illegally sharing ""videos"".  Give me a call. -Sparky""

No  further action was taken on my end because the damn location was  getting shut down. What would be the point? No call was made to me from  the Ops Manager but I did get a very apologetic email that was vague on  details but acknowledged he pulled a bonehead move.

TLDR; User complains about slow internet at a site.  Turns out he's slowing it down because of the P2P ""videos"" he's sharing.",888,0,1
A very satisfying unplug.,"I am still weak at the knees while writing this. Please forgive any spelling and grammar errors.


History: 3.5 years ago I started working for Company. They own multiple private schools around the world. I was given 2 schools to support. My 1st day at Site1 was a horrifying learning experience. 2003 DC and a Media drive that was litteraly an external HD plugged into a managers computer. Over the years I have sent emails explaining, with links, just how truly awful these 2 things are. Supporting the Server and Media have been a bane.


Over the last 2 years, Company have been running a country wide hardware upgrade. All Staff and Students got upgraded computers, tablets and laptops. Bet you can guess what didn't get upgraded?


Over the weekend Head Office finally moved all the staff files online. (Yes, our 2003 DC was also the File Server) Today I had the glorious task of decommissioning the Media ""server"" from the system.   


I went upstairs and entered the office. Caressing the Drive, I methodically followed the cable back to it's slot in the PC. Carefully I slowly slide the USB cable out of the computer. A shudder passed through me as I felt the HD's spin themselves down under my palm. Reverently, I picked up the Drive and gently wiped the dust from it's cover. Then I shook the shit out of the bastard!

The Bug,"We had a very annoying bug in the new FTTH software we were giving our customers. For those who don’t know or don’t remember, I’m a tier 2 agent for an ISP. The bug was causing customer’s phones to auto hang up when they were on it for long periods of time, usually after about a couple hours. Personally, I don’t talk on my phone besides at work for longer than five minutes but that’s besides the point. This bug has since been fixed about a few weeks ago, and this issue happened about a month ago.

We had told our tier 1 agents multiple times that this was a known issue and we were to receive zero tickets about it because our boss would get us to call these tickets if we’d get any, and it would simply waste our time. We’d still get tickets from lazy T1 agents or T1 agents that didn’t want to explain to customers that it was a known issue. 

There was a T1 agent who sent a ticket for a customer who I will refer to as Loon or L for short. This is how that call back went.

&gt; Me: Hi, this is Me. Is this Loon? I’m calling back about the ticket regarding *Bug.* 

&gt; L: Oh, yes. Did you fix it?

&gt; Me: Actually, I’m calling to let you know that this is a known issue, and we’re working on a fix. There are multiple customers affected by this. Please be patient, we do understand how frustrating it can be. 

&gt; L: So, you’re just hacking into our software and telling us it’s a known issue? 

&gt; Me: *confused* I’m sorry? 

&gt; L: I’ve been around on this planet long enough to know when you people are hacking into my phone line. I’ve already had to unplug everything in my **house** to stop you people from spying on me. I like making long phone calls, I don’t need or want you people spying on me. I should report this to the police.

&gt; Me: L, we are not tapping or hacking into your phone line. There is a well known issue at the moment and I’m just calling to let you know that it will be fixed with time. 

&gt; L: That’s bull! *click* (They swore)

The key to success,"Posted this as a reply on another thread but thought it deserved an expansion on the story.

Back in the late '80s I worked for a Point of Sale company. We served mostly the restaurant/hotel industry.

One of our lines was a fully programmable register with preset function keys.

Basically they were programmed with pictures of the food on the keyboard so you could use sub-minimum wage labor to run them.

One of our customers was a sub shop. and I don't know where they got their employees but these were not the best and brightest. 

Now a quirk of these machines was the printer. You could use it to validate checks. You put the check in the printer and it would print the transaction number on it. 

Now paying by check in restaurants is fairly uncommon but it did happen back then. And at this site this is how it usually went...

Ring up the transaction.

Enter the amount tendered.

Press the ""Check"" transaction key.

The display would then say ""Insert Check and press any key to continue...""

Idiot clerk would then say ""I don't see the any key...""

I can swear as gospel that this happened because I heard it with my own ears as I was training them on the machine.

Now I could have changed the prompt to say ""Press the Check (or any other) key to continue"" but me being a smartass instead added a new key to the keyboard and labelled it ""ANY"". 

Problem solved.",863,0,1
I should have been smarter.,"Great sub here girls and boys, (just shorted out recently) and getting plenty of laughs scrolling thru. Which reminded me of a frustrating situation I had some years ago with a client of ours whilst offering support on their Point of Sale terminal. 

I took a call from a client who said they were having trouble getting their computer to work.  
 So after the standard 2 \~ 3 minutes of what she was referring to when saying “The computer wasn’t working”  I realised that it was in fact the software that wasn’t responding. So I asked her to press the Escape key to clear the error. Anyway she couldn’t find the escape key, so I told her it’s the button on the top left-hand corner of the keyboard. She still couldn’t find it….  
 Me, thinking ok, POS terminal, it may be elsewhere.  
 So I got her to read some of the buttons/locations on the keyboard back to me F4 F3 F2 F1.  
 ME - yep, yep, yep good ok. (You guessed it, still no escape key...&amp; you can’t stop them talking when their on a roll) anyway after an awkward/frustrating several minutes of her announcing just about every letter in the alphabet &amp; describing nearly every other button on the keyboard, she advises me that she indeed has a button in the top left hand corner with **ESC** written on it…Could that be it ????  
 

ME: Ohh, I’am not too sure. ( I was exhausted by this time) can you try pressing that one for me instead then.

 Her:  ”Click” YES, I fixed it!!

Customer demands we ship him a replacement,"I have a story to share. I work in a chat based call center and this pandemic has caused customers to be crazier than usual. This one guy chatted in with about an issue with his product that ended up being hardware related. I gave him his service options which were to either bring it to the store or mail it into our service center. 

He instead demanded that we ship him a new one instead of him bringing it to the store or mailing it in because he had been with X company for a long time. When I told him this wasn't something we offer he demanded to speak to a supervisor. At the time we were of course having system issues as well so I couldn't transfer the chat to one of our chat senior advisors so I let him know that hey, we are experiencing some issues at this time with contacting our senior team. You are more than welcome to call X number to speak with them or you can chat back in in a couple hours and we will get you right over to them.

Learning is hard / No no no!,"Working at a cellular retailer in a small town (&gt;2000pop) was definitely an experience like no other.  But some of the tech support happenings stand out to this day.

Mr Customer came in a few minutes before closing hoping for a quick fix getting his work email functioning on his work phone.  It looked like he'd made an attempt at setting it up, but there was some key information missing.  Serendipitously enough I had interviewed for a potential job with his IT department not too long before, so I knew names and had contact info for their office.  I called and got the necessary information, and had a nice chat while entering it on his device.

The whole time Customer was in our shop he complained bitterly about how technology was needlessly complicating our lives, how techies all think they're superior, you know, the usual technophobe stuff.  It was the end of a long day, there were no other customers in the shop, and I was getting irritated with his tirade.  I definitely slipped into jerk-face mode and started worming my way into his mind via his growing emotional state.

It didn't take much.  I started by asking about learning and changes in technology, and any time I picked up on some body language or eye movement, I'd take the conversation in that direction.  Within minutes he was quite literally jumping up and down and yelling ""NO NO NO I DON'T WANT TO LEARN I DON'T WANT TO LEARN NO NO NO!..."" like a small child.  At this point I kinda snapped out of the mental place I'd gone to and realized what I'd done to this poor luddite who just wanted to read emails on his phone.

I finished with his phone, handed it back to him, and he was on his way (presumably to find a stiff drink).  I got some terrified looks from my coworker while we locked up, which I shrugged off, and the day ended.  But the sight of a full-grown man bouncing up and down and yelling has stuck with me since.

The software won’t allow it because that would defeat the purpose of UNIQUE. Now if you look here *opens the search options drop-down* you can search by patient ID. Or last name if you prefer. 

lUser: ...... ya, but, like.... iunno, I’ll figure something out... *continues on with another completely stupid issue...*

UPDATE: admittedly, the seriousness of the consequences of this stories user’s actions had not fully donned on me until you guys brought it up. Being a techie, I was thinking how much of a pain it was going to be when they realized they had a bunch of duplicate records and wanted us in support to fix it for them, not specifically what it meant for their patients. I’ll be introspecting on that for a while. 

I did bring it up with my supervisor, and she’s reviewing our business associate’s agreement. 

I would like to add that the software I support is dedicated to X-ray imaging only. It doesn’t track things like allergies, previous diagnosis, medications prescribed... our customers use other softwares for that, and one can only hope this user isn’t so ignorant with whichever patient management software they use. But it is still a very serious violation of HIPAA concerns, as xrays are integral for diagnosis.",1470,0,1

Aw  gawwd, you just made me pstd to a couple of days back. I am an IT guy,  and most of my users are moderately competent at using the equipment I  so kindly provide and maintain for them.

But  this user, lets call her Steph, well, she is a black hole because she  very dense and not super bright.  Because of the minor discomfort of a  global pandemic she is working from home. Because we are an  international company with a complex and super secret box of network  resources, Steph needed access to our vpn. And usually its simple,  people can mostly figure it out on their own. Not Steph, I knew I was  gonna need to do it for her and explain how do it again for future  reference. Turns out I overestimated her.

""Ok, first, open up zoom and send me a message, so I can remote into your computer""  
She says ok.

Fifteen minutes pass.

""Steph, Im waiting for you""

""I Cant find it""

""Steph, I left it on your desktop""

""I cant finde it""

I  was slightly angry cause it was 10 pm and I wake up at 6, and I have  been running non stop 10 hour turns with not a single day off for three  weeks.

Turns out she somehow Managed to delete zoom, on a user account with no admin privileges.",183,0,1
Our app is too new to support,"So I had a very interesting conversation the other day that in the moment kinda sounded reasonable, but the more I thought about it, the less sense it made.

Subject: Monitoring software that a group of users decided they needed, did not include us in the aquisistion of, did not provide us any information about, and periodically raise a fuss to us when it doesn't work, often leaving us to work with the vendor who periodically comes on-site to configure/update/etc... while we are remote tech support.

**Kapn**: Me, the hero of our story

**Manager**: My boss, kinda new, still learning the ropes

**Vendor Rep:** Tech support for the Vendor of the software in question.

\---

**Manager**: KapnBanjo, I need you to call Vendor, there's a problem with the monitoring software at one of our sites, and they are saying it's a problem with our envirenment being incompatible with the software.

**Kapn**:  Uh, sure, but isn't it working elsewhere? How can it be incompatible if it's working?

**Manager**: Well, they think it's because of Group Policy

**Kapn**: That doesn't make any sense, the people it's working for are in the same policy

**Manager**: Thats a good point to raise, with them.

**Kapn**: I got the hint, calling the Vendor.

\---

**Vendor Rep**: You have everything locked down, so I can't fix the problem with these new users.

**Kapn**: Is it still working for the old users?

**Vendor Rep:** Yeah, you must have them in a different, hold on... ""Org-an-i-zation Unit"" is what I think it's called

**Kapn**: They are all in the same OU

**Vendor Rep:** Oh, well everything is locked down so I don't think I can make any changes so this will work

**Kapn**: So we don't have that much locked out, and what we do is locked out for everyone, so the old users would have the same problem. Do you know what was changed when the old users were setup?

**Vendor Rep:** No, I wasn't the rep that did that.

**Kapn**: Usually most vendors I work with have a knowledge base or somewhere they can go that will tell them what settings and what the application needs to work.

**Vendor Rep:** We just released this new version of the software 2 months ago, so we really don't know what it needs, or what the requirements are.

**Kapn**: You don't have like a knowledge base for the products you support?

**Vendor Rep:** We do, but it's all for older versions, and I've been unable to find anything that tells me what it needs to run. I don't know how we find that out.

**Kapn**: Well we have users it works for, and users it doesn't, I guess we'll need to figure out which settings are different between the people it works for and those it doesn't work for.

**Vendor Rep:** Will I need to do that, or can you?

**Kapn**: I mean, when are you next on site?

**Vendor Rep:** Tomorrow morning

**Kapn**: And it's end of day today, so I think it would make sense for you to do it while you're there, what do you have scheduled for your visit tomorrow?

**Vendor Rep:** fixing this issue.

**Kapn**: Ok, then yeah, I think it makes sense for you to try to find out what your software's requirements are and let us know.

**Vendor Rep:** Can I call you if I need help?

**Kapn**: ...Sure, why not.",1210,0,1
You're Handing Me this? Yeah Nah," \-Some details were obviously changed: Names, phone system type, exact circumstances have some details omitted, etc. all changed-

I am a trained firearms instructor for the Marine Corps, at least when it came to range activities. Taught the classes where Marines all sit/prone/Stand 'shooting' at the barrel with the targets, basic CQB shooting, Pistols, and would coach on range days. Was the best 6 months of my USMC life. Took some firearm classes from a NRA/SWAT guy too for personal/Civilian carry, worked Nuke Security too for a few years. Very comfortable around all firearms, to say the least

Anyway, we're troubleshooting an XyzXyz PBX phone system in a property we own that was installed in the mid 90s, and have to call in a company who knows how to actually troubleshoot the parts. I can do some work on them, but its mostly command line/moving lines that Im familiar with. These PBX parts generally have to be removed, sent in to be refurbished as new parts just aren't available. This company also did the original install in 199#, and the contact I normally speak with about the system has retired to a warmer state. So, new tech ""Bob"" comes in. He also assisted in the phone system setup in 199#, but Ive never met/spoke with him previously. So, Bob and I get to chatting when he comes in, gets around to firearms as I see he has a sidearm when he took off his coat. Odd he's packing open carry, but hey You Do You. I never carry on the job, but do carry conceal on my off time. I mention I was a vet and ask a few questions about the gun, and get a text from the boss asking how things are going after Bob's been there about 30 minute. Look down to answer, and when I look up from my cell, the dude had pulled out his sidearm, removes the mag and just hands it to me muzzle first with the muzzle pointed downward.

I in no way asked to be handed a weapon. I dont know the dude at all beyond the 10 minutes we've been chatting during the 30 or so minutes he's been around. He didnt clear the chamber or show me that it was empty nor confirmed that the mag well was empty. Muscle memory took over, and I immediately remove the weapon from his possession and check that the mag is removed and rack the slide to lock it back. And, of course in doing so, out flies a round from the chamber.

Now, it was a dummy round BUT HE STILL HANDED ME A WEAPON WITH A ROUND IN THE CHAMBER AND WITHOUT HIM VERIFYING WITH ME THE MAG WELL WAS CLEAR NOR THAT THERE WAS A FUCKING DUMMY ROUND CHAMBERED IN THERE TOO.

At this point Im slightly stunned. After clearing it, examine it and quickly hand it back in a safe manner. He picks up the dummy round, puts it on top of the mag and chambers it back in the weapon, and pulls the trigger on the dummy round. I was about to leave to call my supervisor...

AND THEN HE HANDS ME HIS CONCEAL CARRY BACKUP THE EXACT SAME WAY.

Legit, I was too stunned at the dude to speak immediately. Im not afraid of the weapons, but Bob came into our building with loaded weapons and was just handing them to me in a potentially unsafe manner, without my asking to handle them in the first place. I hand them back, having locked back the slides and showing empty chambers and clear mag well before doing so. Bob doesn't even put them back into his holsters, and leaves them sitting on his coat behind him. Wait 5 minutes, say I gotta go piss and call my supervisor. 10 minutes later there's a cop escorting the dude out, with clear instructions that he's no longer welcome. Bob probably wasn't a direct threat, but his careless handling certainly was.

The issue was power related on the digital card carrier, and needed sent out and refurbished. But hey, phone system was fixed! Took a few weeks longer, as we had a nice conversation with the vendor about the behavior of their tech. Of all the things I expected to be handed while working in IT, this was not one of them!",1059,0,1

I don't care even my support entitlement is 8 x 5 and I want my issue to be solve!,"another story which I also want to share

so I was helping out by going on-site with a firewall issue and I do inform the Customer that extra token will be deducted as their support entitlement is 8 x 5 (meaning we cannot support them after office hours)

in the end we spend the night until 2am to troubleshoot and we have confirm that it is hardware issue. the best part is the customer did not buy an hardware loaner support therefore we are unable to provide him 1.

so the next morning he call our Sale Manager talking this and that. out of good will we try to help him and setup a hardware loaner support at his office however there are other issue which the firewall traffic did not work as per what it was. we believe AWS could be issue. he insist us to solve the issue on the spot however we did not do so and left the his office at 3am. (we need time to look into the logs and see what is wrong)

fast forward on the 3rd day the Customer called Sale Manager why so much token was deducted even we did not solve the problem. in my heart I am like what! the best part is he even call the Vendor and say that our company did not do anything to help him. this really drive the sale manager mad over this as the vendor call and scold my sale manager saying that we are nt helpful

so the Sale Manager decide to charge him on the rental of the hardware loaner at xxK per week  and also saying their his replacement firewall software is EOS so need to upgrade and charge him as professional service at xxK

after the Customer Boss see the bills send by my company. I think she could have fainted or really want to kill the Customer for being too extreme to us(the total bill is 5 digit in USD without adding the cost of the token deducted) she send an email to us and say ""thank you for your hard work and support etc etc""

currently the Customer has tone down alot and don't dare to be so demanding. it was an eye opener for me that how harsh things can be when you really offended somebody",326,0,1
I did not made any changes to the load balance and the load balance fail by itself,"so I was assign this case when my customer tell me that their Server Loading Balancing is not working

I just look at the logs and see what could went wrong and I was working with the vendor to see what cause by the root cause.

I call the customer the next day

Me: ""hello this is xxx from xxx can we confirm that you have never done any changes to the load balance?""

customer: ""no no! I never do anything and the load balance fail by itself""

Me: "" alright we will back to you again""

feel puzzled on this because there is no way the load balance will fail by itself and stop assigning traffic to the server. so I decide to work with the vendor and look at the admins log file(hoping that we can find some clue)

turn out one of the customer colleague did a change by disabling the Server loading balancing option(I never find out why) due to this that why they unable to access to the server.

so I just send the screenshot of the log file and explain to customer and case closed.

it would be better if my customer want to find out if others have done any changes instead of keeping say that the load balance failed by itself",172,0,1

You're Overcharging Us!,"You all enjoyed my [Karen story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ggbnfb/delete_my_account_now/) from a few days ago, so I thought I'd bring you another one from my time in the web hosting game.

A number of years into the job I'd been promoted a few times and now was part of the senior support/admin team.  I rarely spoke to the lower end customers (unless it was an incident escalated up to our team) and usually only dealt with Dedicated/VPS or Enterprise customers.  The ones that paid a lot of money for services and generally knew what they were talking about.

One day I pick up a ticket from one customer who had a managed VPS with us.  This VPS supported a somewhat popular online store. I didn't recognise the name of the person who submitted the ticket, but I guessed it must have been a new tech on their end.  The ticket itself was simple:  please let us know the full specs of our VPS, any add-ons and a breakdown in cost.  I replied to the ticket with all the requested info and went on with my day.

Later in the week I get an IM from one of the phone reps.  There's a customer on the phone who wants to talk to me, in relation to the aforementioned ticket.  I found it odd he'd called the general support number, as our VPS customers had a direct phone number to us.  The call was transferred to me.

Me:  ""Good afternoon, this is goatwomble, how can I help?""

Customer: ""Yeah, hi. I've just bought this business and have been doing an audit.  I've found that you're overcharging us, and we could be getting the same thing for a 10th of the price.""

Me: ""Ok, I remember sending you the specs and pricing, if I recall you're actually on a legacy deal, so you're paying a little less than most other customers, plus you have some free stuff included that you'd otherwise be paying for.""

Customer: ""That's crap, I'm looking at your web page right now.  I can get better specs for $15 a month, yet you're charging me $280 a month!  I want you to move me to that deal today"".

It was here I realised he'd been looking at the shared hosting packages, comparing those specs to that of his VPS. He also may not have understood the difference between shared and VPS.  

Me: ""Well, you've got a VPS with us, because you need that to support your online store.  It's highly unlikely it's going to run properly on a shared server.  In fact, I'm sure you've got a fair amount of customisation that we can't do on the shared platform.""

Customer: ""Again, that's crap.  I'm looking at the specs here, and they're better than what I've got now. So if it runs on what I have now, it'll run on this.  Move me to the $15 package.""

This went back and forth a few times, and he was adamant about moving to shared hosting.  I managed to convince him that it would take a few days to organise, which he accepted.  I then walked over to my boss.

Me: ""Hey, bossman.  \*explains situation\*""

Bossman: ""Ok, we'll do what he wants.  However I'll take the ticket and get him to understand what he's doing, the risks and how it's not our problem if it shits the bed.  Then you can migrate him over to shared.""

So Bossman pens a lengthy ticket reply, to which Customer writes back with ""yeah, whatever, do it"".

The next day I do a straight migration over to a shared server, do the other needfuls and switch his DNS over.  I also shut down his VPS.

I check his site and - as expected - it's not loading.  It'd taken maybe three minutes to hit max resources.  It took him another two minutes to get on the phone to us.  Again, he'd called the general support number.  And because he now only had shared hosting and was no longer entitled to priority support, the phone rep refused to transfer him over to us.

All up, his store was offline for about three days.  In that time he'd managed to get through to some senior managers, who told us to turn on the VPS and switch over to that in the interim until they worked it all out.  The customer was screaming for compensation and threatened to get lawyers involved, however once management listened to the calls and read the ticket history, they told him there was no chance of that happening and he could fuck right off.

A couple months after this he cancelled the VPS service with us, telling us he was moving to a more reliable company.  I hope it worked out for him.",2092,0,1
My keyboard won't read my ID card,"This happened at an IT support job I had a couple of years ago. The only context needed is that our clients required specific ID-cards issues to them, to log into various system. This is my first post, and English is not my native language, so please be kind!  

The call started in the most amazing way possible. I answered the phone, and was immediately greeted by a man who sounded very nervous, and a woman screaming hysterically in the background that she was ""having a psychosis"". The man explained that his wife had called us 8 times this morning (we had received a total of 5 calls this morning, all from different users) and that she had waited 30 minutes in queue to even get to speak to us (our support line did not have a queue). I asked him to explain what the problem is.

man: my wife can't access critical systems that she needs.

me: what are these systems? Is she getting any error messages?

man: \*to woman\* what are the sys-

woman: THEY'RE NOT WORKING!

man: They're not working!

me: Could you explain what is happening when she is trying to access the systems? Could I speak to her directly?

man: She doesn't want to talk to you

woman: I REFUSE TO TALK TO THEM AGAIN

The call basically went on like this. I was trying to ask questions to get information to solve their problem, but they kept throwing accusations or other unrelated pieces of information, and we were unfortunately not allowed to hang up on clients, and after a while it came to this:

me: is there a problem with her internet access? is her login card not working? 

woman: THEY ARE BREAKING THE LAW

man: she says you are breaking the law!

woman: THEIR SYSTEMS NEED TO BE AVAILABLE

me: I'm sorry. This call has gone on for 15 minutes now and you still haven't told me what system you're trying to acc-

man: The systems need to be available

me:  Yes, but there are no servers or services reported down in our system. I need to at least know what system she's trying to access if I'm going to escalate this. But before I can do that I need to be sure that it's not just a client-side issue.

man: \*to woman\* He says he needs to know what systems are you trying to access, can you show m-

woman: TELL THEM! 

man: You should know that she has friends in \*insert generic management group\*, and if this isn't solved now they will get involved.

woman: THEY WILL FIRE THE \*\*\*\* OUT OF HIM

\*I was quiet for a few seconds because I did not expect this, although the thought of being fired from the job seemed kinda nice at this point!\*

me: I'm sorry, I don't know who they are. But could you please tell me what the issue is when she's trying to access the systems.

Instead of answering the question, the man asked for the number of my boss. Which I provided. He then proceeded to threaten to call that number that I had just given him, unless I solved the issue, and fast! 

me: alright. Just try to access the system now and tell me what happens.

man: he says to try and log in now

\*a few seconds pass\*

woman: ITS NOT WORKING

\*loud bangs\*

Now im not sure if all these years in customer support has destroyed my brain, or if this genuinely makes sense, but as soon as I heard that noise, I realized she was slamming her login card on the keyboard.

me: what card reader is she using?

man: card reader?

\*loud bangs continue\*

woman: WHY CANT IT JUST \*\*\*\*\*\*\* WORK

me: if her computer does not have a slot for cards, she needs to plug a card reader into the computer.

him: That sounds overkill. why?

me: so it can read the card and log her into the system

him: then why don't we need a card reader everywhere?

me: you only need them for some of our systems

him: no, like in general. This is bullshit. We don't even own a card reader.

\*caller hangs up\*

They called again later, and my colleague was the lucky guy this time. It turned out she wasn't even using the login card that the company had issued for her. She was slamming her drivers license against a laptop keyboard and expecting that to authenticate her to the systems she was trying to access.

Most of our clients were better than this. But there were a few calls that, when I write them out, they just look completely unbelievable. Even so, I have found that being a tech support guy is often like being a free therapist that you're allowed to shout at. Even so I did generally like the job for the remaining time I had it, and eventually switched to work with back end msp.",574,0,1
Please hold for TIMMAH!,"I have been with my employer for quite a long time now, and have been in many positions within the company. At one point, maybe 2005 or 2006, I was the technical manager, who managed our programmers and technical support staff. As a small software company in the technology sector, we like to stay current and usually implement and adopt things early. VOIP was one of the things that really revolutionized the business world back then, and we rolled out a fancy new system with all the bells and whistles.

This also coincided with the meteoric rise in popularity of the show South Park, and amongst the dorks in our office, it was a popular topic of conversation. In the show, a character named Timmy has very little dialogue other than screaming his name; TIMMAH!! One of the programmers, who’s name is Tim, earned the affectionate nickname TIMMAH, which everyone said in the Timmy voice, every time Tim entered the room.

An episode eventually released with Timmy singing a song, which included just a bunch of the word TIMMAH, over and over again, to a tune. Naturally, a panel of local nerds convened and concluded we had to immediately make this Tim’s ringtone on our new VOIP system. It took a little work to sample and convert the audio to the correct format and upload it to the phone system… but to a bunch of bored techs at the office, it was pretty fun.

The outcome was nothing short of epic. When an incoming call came to Tim’s phone, Timmy sprung to life and serenaded the office with a melodious round of TIMMAHs. We even changed the message tone to say GOBBLES, one of the only other words spoken by the character.

Over time, Tim’s coworkers tired of the tone, so he eventually changed it, and that’s where the story should have ended… 

&amp;#x200B;

… Until months later, when I pick up a call from someone who was being routed from our call queue. As I picked up the line, he was laughing, and he complimented us on our interesting choices in hold music. Confused, I asked for clarification… he said after the first classical tune stopped playing, but before the next symphony, he heard at least a minute of incoherent words that sounded like TIMMAH over music.

Apparently, the phone system used our custom ring tone as hold music. I will always wonder how many customers had to listen to the TIMMAH song while waiting for help, on hold with us.",1177,1,1
Working From Home Does Not Change Your Responsibilities,"Before we implemented the outright blocking of external storage devices (could be its own TFTS story due to even more Security Team terribleness), we highly discouraged users from using those things at all. We asked users to contact IT when then needed something loaded onto external storage or checked and copied off and onto the network or a user’s PC. This happened regularly, as a lot of our clients send and receive data on CDs or flash drives. These tasks have always been the responsibility of our Security Team. 

Today my group got a couple of tickets for the same thing: a request to burn files to a CD to send to a client. I immediately got annoyed at the Helpdesk, thinking they mis-assigned tickets yet again. When I looked at the tickets though, I see that one of the Security Techs assigned the ticket to my group with the following note:

&gt;SecurityTech: Security does not have the ability to do this with no one from Security in the office. 

Really? I took a screenshot of the note and sent it to my manager in a chat message.

&gt;Me: See above. This makes it Desktop Support’s problem because????

&gt;Desktop Manager: What’s the ticket number?

&gt;Me: There’s two. #51534 and #51726.

Plugging the USB Type-B into a printer the correct way.,"First full-on story, not sure if this belongs here, mods feel free to remove if not. No names for obvious privacy, but not needed here.

TL;DR got paid by showing my aunt how to plug the USB Type-B the right side up.

So, we all know there's always that one guy in the entire family that basically serves as tech support, right? I'm **that** guy. I get called by my aunt to help her deal with her kids being absent and needing to post explanations (not sure if it's a correct term) about their absence to school.

*'No problem'*, I'm thinking to myself, *'We'll just print out a few pages to write them explanations'*. Now, keep in mind that about a couple months ago, I installed Lubuntu into that PC (somewhat relevant). So I was optimistic that the drivers should get picked up right away.

Nope. Even though it's powered and plugged in, printer ain't being detected. ***\`lsusb\`*** confirms my suspicion. I spend about an hour trying to get the drivers going, cause I figured it might be drivers. Nope. I get my laptop and a spare cable I had in my backpack and peek over to the back of the printer.

The Type-B USB cable seemed fine on the outside. I pull it out. Cable itself has no obvious damage. so I plug it back in. Goes in a little stiff but it gets in there. Still nothing. Now I think it's the cable, so I grab the spare I had.

As a habit, I check the port and the cable to make sure they align. Upon plugging it in, the printer starts chugging right away. That's when it hits me.

The original cable had been plugged in **UPSIDE DOWN.**

I help the aunt fill out the absence explanations, scan them in and send them out. She hands me payment and I drive away, wondering to myself how can you fit the USB cable upside down.

Of passwords and unauthorized devices,"This one happened earlier today and further dumbfounded me as to how bold some users can be with equipment that is not their's...

I picked up a ticket for a user that was having a problem getting his password to sync between the domain and his laptop. He, like the majority of our user base now (and probably most of the world), has been working from home and he was prompted to change his password recently. He did so yesterday or the day before, but submitted the ticket when his laptop would repeatedly not take the new password he's changed it to. The corporate VPN would accept the new password, but no matter what he did, the laptop was stuck on the old password. At this point, I got the ticket from tier 1 with full understanding of the situation so I had to call the user to have him come in to the office to try and sync the passwords while being directly connected to the network (I'm still working in the office because I can't exactly work from home and handle hardware issues).

Cast of characters is self-explanatory so I won't bother with descriptions. Script is paraphrased:

**$Me:** ""Good morning, $user. I understand you're having an issue with getting your recently changed password to sync over to your laptop...""

**$User**: ""Yes, let me fill you in on what's happened..."" (proceeds to tell me everything that's already been outlined in the ticket)

**$Me:** ""OK, so at this point, you'll have to come in to the office and we'll see if that can get your system synced to the domain.""

**$User**: ""Sure, I can be there within the next half hour or so. While I'm there, could you look at another issue I've been having as well? My system's been bluescreening a couple times a week and it's a bit frustrating.""

**$Me**: ""Yeah, that won't be a problem.""

**$User:** ""Will I need to wait outside in my car while you're looking that over? How long will it take?""

**$Me:** ""Well, I'll actually need you here so that you can enter your password on your laptop to sign in, so you'll need to come in the building. As for how long it'll take, that honestly depends on what could be causing it. It could be as simple as updating a driver or it could end up being as bad as needing to reimage the system. I won't have a better answer until I have a better idea of what's going on.""

**$User:** ""Okay, no problem. So should I take out the second SSD that I have in my system? Do you think that could be causing the bluescreens?""

**$Me:** (after a rather lengthy pause) ""You...you installed another drive in your system? Is that something we did for you?""

**$User:** ""No, I went out and bought one and put it in myself. The 512 GB in there wasn't big enough since I'm a developer.""

**$Me:** (another lengthy pause, still trying to process the addition of another SSD) ""Well, realistically, it shouldn't cause a bluescreen issue but you're really not supposed to be changing stuff on your system. That sort of thing needs to be approved and performed by us.""

**$User:** ""Oh...okay. I'll take it out and see you in about half an hour.""

\*End call\*

When he arrived on-site I ended up having to do a bit more than just plugging his system into the network and giving it a moment to sync. First, it wouldn't sync because when he tried signing in under his profile, it said the domain trust relationship had been lost. So I signed in with the local admin account - known only to the techs - and tried getting online. That failed because he had set a static IP on it from his home network...another facepalm (leave it on DHCP people!!). Once he removed that I rejoined it to the domain and all was happy.

I advised him to leave the second drive out for a few days and see if the system bluescreens again. Then I told him if that does fix it and he needs more storage capacity, let us know and we could work something out with him, that maybe we could get him a larger SSD and reimage it appropriately.  Otherwise he'd have to use external storage and not go dinking around with his company-issued laptop.

I know it shouldn't at this point but it continuously astounds me as to how people think that the laptop we provide to them for work can be used and messed with any way they please! It's bad enough they store gigs and gigs of pictures of little Timmy's birthday party, and the family vacation, and whatever other non-work related nonsense...but to be so bold as to modify the system without letting us know? That's ballsy.

TL;DR: User calls in reporting a password issue, then proceeds to tell on himself that he installed a second drive on his own in his company-issued laptop without authorization.",221,0,1
Ticket from Indiana,"I worked for a big multi-national company several years ago, only in a low-level grunt position. I was hired for one specific task, but I was occasionally told to do some other miscellaneous tech support things. I was mostly assigned to do work in the offices in my local area, but I would do tickets remotely for people when they related to my  specific focus.

One day, I got a ticket from a guy in Indiana. Some issue with an Oracle database or something, it absolutely not my specialty. Nonetheless, I figured I'd try to help the guy. I shot him an email and an instant message....and he never replied except at really weird times. Eventually he stopped responding, so I closed out the ticket.

...only for him to re-open it again. So, I shot off emails and instant messages, never got a reply during my office hours, and ended up closing it, and he'd re-open it again. I did try harder and harder to help him, I even got a few phone calls with him, but the quality was absolute garbage and I could never understand him through his thick accent. 

Eventually, I take a look at the ticket's details, noting the location of IN. I then realized that IN did not stand for Indiana, but it in fact stood for India. I then transferred the ticket to the correct person in India, explained what had happened, and realized that my co-worker was right about what he said about the guy who assigned me that ticket in the first place.",415,0,1
You need WHICH ports open again?,"So, a couple of years ago I was doing phone support for a firewall product.  It was a pretty nice place to work, and the customers tended to be pretty technical so their questions actually made me think, which is a nice change from a lot of support roles I've been in.

I get a call one day from a gentleman whose case is titled something like ""Help opening ports for ip phones"" which was a super common sort of call.  He asks me to set up a remote session, and we get that set up and I can see he's already in the firewall management interface so I am looking forward to a pleasant few minutes and then closing out the call.

So I ask him, ""Exactly which ports did you need opened up?""

""I need ports 1000 to 65535, tcp and udp, bidirectional""

""On your perimeter firewall""

""Yes""

...

So I think for a second, and I ask him

""Did your vendor happen to send you a list of the ports you needed open?""

And he pulls up Outlook and he shows me the email from &lt;IP telephony vendor&gt;, and it is asking for exactly what he asked for.  Every port above 1000, open to the world.

This is where I started to panic a little, because while I am not certain how to best explain to him that this is not a good idea I am certain that it is NOT a good idea and yet he is already in the management interface and we are about six mouse clicks and a little typing away from making his firewall functionally worthless.

And then I look at his customer record and I see that his email address is something like it\_admins@&lt;domain&gt; and this is obviously a mailbox that is going to be read by, with any luck, every IT guy they have.

""Sir, would you mind if I took a couple of minutes and just put the steps to accomplish this into an email for you?""

""Oh sure that would be fine.""

So we end the call, and  write up an email thanking him profusely for contacting &lt;firewall manufacturer&gt; tech support, and summarizing his request, and noting that this request is per the email he received from &lt;ip telephony vendor&gt; and then providing the steps to do exactly what he wanted with a little note about how unusual this sort of thing is, and then I send it to the it\_admins email address and pray.

A few minutes later, I get a terse email from a different guy at &lt;domain&gt; thanking me for my support and telling me to close the case.

To this day, I'm not certain it got seen by the right eyes.  But I am still hopeful.",2023,0,1
Purple screen of death,"This was about 7 or 8 years ago I think. I was working retail on the tech floor of a office store and on some days I would also work the on site tech support counter if that guy was sick or something. I sold an apple thunderbolt monitor to a middle aged lady who made me Promise her it would be as simple as plugging in the cables and it would work. It was why she was getting the thunderbolt version instead of the minidysplayport version which had 1 more cable to plug in I believe. We checked which Mac book she had by looking at her purchase history with our store.  I normally never gave flat out promises because I knew all to well how easily customers can fuck stuff up but I she really insisted and I just couldn't see anything that could wrong after asking her some questions about her set up. 

Of course about 45 minutes later the lady called the tech support counter in a mad frenzy so they called me over because they heard me make the promise and so they felt I should deal with this. 
After taking the phone I had to wait about I got a tirade about how I told her how it was going to be sooooo easy and now she did everything right according to her and and the screen wasn't showing anything. I tried to politely as I could ask if she also plugged in the the power and turned on the power switch. Which cost me another 5 minutes on a lecture on how she isn't stupid. In the back in my head I was thinking great just my luck I sold her one that's broken o well let's check my basis and run through some stuff to see if there is anything out of the order. After having confinced her to describe to her physical set up and nothing being wrong there i got her to open her system preferences so we could check if anything was wrong there. We ran through the screen panel and everything seems fine. At this point she mentioned the screen was just purple. I asked what she did before it turned purple. She tells me it had been purple from the moment she plugged in her MacBook. Aperantly I had missed understood what she meant by the screen not showing anything. I tried asking her to discribe the screen to me. Is there any text on it? She just keeps replying to every question by no it's just purple. Meanwhile I'm Google like crazy if anybody has ever encountered a purple screen on Mac assuming it's some weird blue screen alternative I have never heard of. but I can't find anything. Then the lady starts screaming her MacBook has turned purple too! Now I'm sweating the fuck did I do? We just looked at some screen settings. O God. After some horrible minutes of cursing on the other end of the line I ask her to please describe the screen in as much detail as she can again. ( At this point some of the tech support guys have picked up a phone to listen in and I see them laughing there asses of). She starts it's just purple with white dots a bit like a stary sky..... Suddenly I realize by purple screen she means her desktop background. 

Turns out she never quite a program and haddent really seen her desktop since she bought it. She just need to drag a window to the new screen. Everything had been working this hole time. When her MacBook turned purple she had I think made the gesture for show desktop because Al her apps had hidden. 

So I tip my had to all you people who work in tech support full time and know how to cut through the bull shit. I certainly did not and made this a whole lot more difficult than necessary.",846,0,1
The Outlook Witch,"For context, I work in the public sector at a US state department. Our network can't seem to handle when a user changes their Office password, so Outlook issues are aplenty right now.

Me: ""Alright, what is your username and email address""

""Alright, looks like your password might be expired and my co-workers have reported that Outlook isn't updating after logging in for some folks"". 

We proceed to go through the rigamarole of a password reset and having the user sign out and back in.

""Looks like your able to login in now and your email should update. I also ran a repair on your .OST file just in case.""

Sometimes the problem isn't just that the customer isn't tech savvy...,"I finally get to post here after getting my Security+ and spending a mere 4 months at a 4 letter government agency as a tier 1. As you can imagine our job was to weed out the low level issues that could be solved without bugging the local teams. We were a new shop on a new contract as part of a cost savings plan. Needless to say we didn't have the access we needed to do our jobs right.



I had a couple hard to work with customers that made it difficult to accomplish anything, but this customer took the cake during our 2 hour phone call to resolve Outlook issues...

C: Customer

Me: Me



Me: Thank you for calling the service desk. Can I please get your name and number incase we get disconnected?

C: *Says name as quickly as possible and then immediately jumps into his problem* Outlook doesn't look right. I can't read anything. Now what are we going to do about this?

Me: What do you mean Outlook doesn't look right? Was it able to login and are you receiving emails?

C: Yes I'm logged in. I can't see all the information I usually can. Now what are we going to do about this?


This goes on for about a half hour, usually ending in ""What are we going to do about this?"", before I finally get him to say that his subject lines are only showing a few words before moving on to the main email.

Me: Alright sir, so lets go ahead and go into the view tab and reset everything.*Run him through adjusting his view settings*

C: That didn't fix anything.

Me: My only other solution is to delete your profile and create a new one. Lets go ahead and exit Outlook and pull up the Control Panel.

C: I'm not deleting my profile, I have everything the way I like it. Now what are we going to do about this?


During this time I've tried multiple ways to get him to take a screenshot of his desktop as I can't even fathom what could be wrong. I finally broke with protocol and gave him my personal Jabber so that I could screenshare with him. I was not prepared for all the emails to be in like 40 point font. You couldn't read anything at all and while resetting the view settings should have addressed this even without me knowing, it was still there. At the two hour mark I sent the ticket off to his local team so they could convince him to recreate his profile. 


I learned a lesson that day, and I'll let you know if I figure it out beyond needing a drink after work some days. I've learned more about Outlook these past few months than I ever did during the 10 years I've had to use it. I'll never understand how they break things so badly...",220,0,1
Purple Screen of Death (PSoD; VMware Edition),"A looong time ago VMware ESXi 5.x had this bug: [https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2059053](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2059053) i.e it could crash if you run a VM with intel E1000e NICs instead of VMXNET3.

The funny thing here is that if you see a PSoD message that somewhere contained text 'E1000' it usually was that bug. Actually that bug was really 'popular' for some time.

At the time this happened I know of the bug, I knew what patch I'd have to install but - all VMs were using VMXNET3 so its not urgent.

You probably already guessed it: I was wrong.

So suddenly several VMs were unreachable. Check iLOs... one ESXi down with E1000e PSOD. WTF. Restarted, checked VMs... and there's one that I don't recognize that uses E1000e.

I go investigating and find somebody is testing OS deployment and since he hasn't figured out yet how to deploy VMs with VMware Tools drivers he chose E1000e. I thell him thats bad, there's a bug, it will crash the host, don't do this.

Back to work.

20 Minutes later - VMs down again. Check host - E1000e PSoD again. 

Me: ""What are you doing ?'""

Guy: ""I'm still testing OS deployment of course. Thats my job !""

Me: ""Um... there are some other people in the building who actually also would like to do THEIR jobs which is a bit difficult when production systems go down every 20 minutes....""

We did patch he hosts in the evening. And I googled how to get VMXNET3 drivers that he can use.

I walk back to my cubicle, looking over my shoulder for other ghosts of gigs past. I've realized I'm about to be late for a call- the ""Security Logging Project"", whatever that is. I might learn something.  
  
  
I don't.  
  
  
  Or at least I learn that standup calls at LC are like wandering into a circle of _very_ old friends at a party, telling stories from back in the day. There's an unfamiliar shorthand, but the structure and plots are familiar. People are going around and giving statuses on projects described by acronyms or project numbers. I listen for tone and ignore the particulars. Some projects are dragging and blamestorms are brewing. I'm imagining this call has spawned at least three prep meetings for various groups as well as countless chat sessions with rude comments and shitty memes.  
  

Then I hear about the mythical audit report. People blurt out a few numbers and I pay more attention.   
  
I take notes like I'm some junior agent in the Committee for State Security in 1970's Bulgaria on the numbers station beat- maybe I'll eventually learn what all this gibberish means, but I may get called on it arbitrarily.  
  
  
There is a fair amount of discussion on an Identity Store(IS), which has resulted in a bunch of findings, numbered 32 to 40. Some poor bastard on this call is still confused whether or not IS will supplement or replace their fairly complex Active Directory infrastructure.  
  
  
Now the yelling starts. At least two different voices are arguing that IS was supposed to go live several weeks ago and the pro-IS faction claiming that even late, it's going to be awesome.  
  
  
The call ends. I look up the IS application. Instead of licensing someone else's product, Large Client's rolling their own. And it's, well, *special*. Like some hostile looking fruit, the outside is spiky with APIs supporting all the systems that LC needs.   
  
The middle is the infrastructure of moving authorizations and requests around. There are transaction engines, logging engines and a ring of systems to just translate messages between components.   
  
The Vault in the center holds all the data.   
  
  
Every description of The Vault reads like a brochure written in doge. It's all awkward promises without any technical details. Somehow it describes that all the data is held in 'private cloud blockchain registers'.   
  
  
I search my email for tickets regarding the Vault. Lots of backlogs, it seems. Ian's assigned to some of these tickets. I can't see what they're involving, since I don't have access to the ticketing system.  
  
  
After all this, I decide to go home.  
   
  
The next day, I roll in a little before my first call. Per a late night email, I'm to stop by IT to pick up my LC laptop, so I grab coffee and start there.  
  
  
LC's IT Equipment Dispensing Center(tm) is in the basement, which shares space with Shipping and Receiving. It's all wire cages, bare concrete and boxes of various sizes.  
  
  
Hand written signs are a bit confusing so I have to ask an openly hostile woman at the loading dock. She jabs a begloved hand in the direction of IT.  
  
  
Ever wonder where stained, worn out and mismatched cubicles go to? At LC, they're here. It's less cube maze and more Tricks and Traps from Doom II. Cube walls vary as I walk about to find the right person who has my LC laptop.  
  
  
I find the Equipment Dispensing Center a popular place. There's a plastic chain and a few other people waiting in line. The guy at the front is wearing tan pants with a few extra pockets, a Smedium T-shirt in olive green with a low contrast American flag, a boonie cap and wraparound sunglasses.   
  
He's talking at a young woman waiting behind him. She's engrossed in her phone and wearing earbuds.  
  
  
  
Smedium:""I have to be ready to go at a moment's notice""  
  
  
Engrossed woman:"" ""  
  
  
A muffled voice yells from the other side of a mouse colored cubicle wall:""Ian""  
  
  
Smedium walks over and after a minute or two of signoffs, takes a cheap black laptop bag from behind a counter and walks out of the cube wall maze.  
  
  
Well. Ian seems to have made some changes.  
  
  
About fifteen minutes later, I've moved to the head of the line and introduce myself to a short woman whose eyes have seen things.   
  
  
I show her a ticket ID on my phone. She turns to the desktop in front of her, poke about on the keyboard for a few minutes, then get up, walk over to a library cart filled with identical, cheap laptop bags. She selects one bag, scans the tag on the handle and hands the bag to me.   
 
  
Bag feels light. I open it up and there's a power supply, a shoulder strap and no laptop. I show the woman behind the desk and she goes from sullen boredom to confusion to annoyance. I share her annoyance, but for different reasons. I've got two minutes to find some place quiet to attend a call.  
  
  
Woman:""Can you wait a little bit while I figure this out?""  
  
  
me:""Sorry, not really. I'll leave this bag here and you can email me when you have figured out what's going on""  
  
  
  
Woman:""But I checked out the bag. That's yours""  
  
  
me:""You want me to take an empty bag just to make it easier for you?""  
  
  
I get a blank stare in response.  
  
  
Fine. I take the bag and find what looks like a quiet corner outside to dial in to my first call of the day.  
  
  
The call starts with the usual chatter- who we're waiting for, how everybody's doing. This meeting makes sense to me. We're talking credit card handling. I occasionally lean in and try to make recommendations to make things better.  
  
  
The participants have a debate about holding credit card numbers for re-occurring purchases without customer involvement. I talk encryption. A hyperkinetic person named Aarush is violently agreeing with me about the need to encrypt _everything_ and that we can leverage his Identity Store capabilities.  
  
  
  
I make the mistake of opening my mouth.  
   
  
me:""Handling credit card processing expands the scope and expense of PCI compliance. You've just made the Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) your entire company""  
  
  
Aarush:""But it's all encrypted in the blockchain""  
  
  
me: I want to explain in detail how bad this idea is, but I know to not go into technical details until I understand them. Expecially not on a project management call. I collapse my comments to a terse:""There are several reasons why that's a *bad* idea, but that's better detailed on a smaller call.""  
  
  
  
I let the call move into other directions and stop paying attention until I hear my name again.  
  
  
Howard (the product owner):""LawTechie will work with Aarush and his team to work out a solution""   
 
  
  
me:""Uh?""  
  
  
Aarush:""That's great! I'll have you work with the lead engineer, Ian""  
  
  
I look at myself, standing in the grass in front of LC's office building, holding an empty laptop bag. I see my bike. I should just go, get my helmet and ride away.     

  
I don't.

"Yeah, I'm the bad guy here...","OK, this one is all me...

I was brand new to the telecom world and was setting up cell sites. Having come from the point of sale industry I was still a bit unclear on best practices in the telecom world.

I was installing point to point microwave DS-1 connections to hub the sites in.

Got to one site and its an unusual setup compared to the ones I had been doing. 

I needed to test the link. The switch used RJ-45 but the cabinet routed it via a wire wrap terminal array. Not a punch panel.

Problem was I was 100 miles from my office and I did not HAVE a wire wrap tool.

What I did have was a couple of RS-232 connector kits. So I grabbed a patch cable, stripped off one end, and soldered the female RS-232 pins to the ends of the wires. The slid perfectly onto the wire wrap pins and the link was good, no errors. I figured once the other techs (with the correct tool) showed up to site I would swap it out with a proper wrap job.

Unfortunately it was a very long day and I completely forgot about it until I was halfway home. By then the site had been accepted and turned up so shutting it down again would have required another site visit and some scheduled down time in the maintenance window (middle of the night to oh my god-thirty). So discretion being the better part of valor, I kept my mouth shut. They accepted the site so its their problem now.

"Hello, wrong number.","I once worked as a programmer for a company that wrote banking software and they wanted me too connect a telephone headset to to the software suite for outgoing calls.

One day I'm happily coding away and I hear a strange sound I never heard before. I looked around and found that the headset was ringing. I put it on and ""hello?"" The person on the other end had dialed a wrong number.

DELETE MY ACCOUNT *NOW*!,"This story took place about 6 years ago, and it was my second week into a new job with a web hosting company.

I'd taken a call from a customer - we'll call her Karen - about some problem with the hosting service she had with us.  I took a look and determined that whilst there was an issue, the fault lay with her CMS and wasn't anything we would fix.

Me:  ""I'm sorry Karen, the issue is to do with WordPress, and unfortunately we can't assist with fixing this.  However, I can send you some links which may help you fix it, or you can ask your developer to look into it further"".

Karen: ""That's not good enough! I'm paying you $10 a month and I expect you to fix problems like this, not tell me to go away and deal with it myself"".

Me: ""I'm sorry you feel that way, however that $10 pays for the server space.  We'll gladly help fix anything server side that's interfering with the proper operation of your site, but we're not responsible for the software itself.""

Karen: ""WE'LL IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIX IT JUST DELETE MY FUCKING ACCOUNT RIGHT NOW""

Me: ""Ok, I can do that, but it may be easier ---""

Karen: ""STOP ARGUING WITH ME DELETE MY ACCOUNT CLEARLY MY $10 A MONTH MEANS SHIT TO YOU GO ON HURRY UP AND TERMINATE MY ACCOUNT IF YOU DON'T VALUE ME AS A CUSTOMER""

Me: ""I can do that for you, before I do, I need to ask if you have a backup of your data, as once I process this it's gone for good""

Karen: ""NO JUST DELETE MY ACCOUNT NOW I EXPECT AN EMAIL TELLING ME IT'S DONE \*click\*""

She'd hung up, and I sat there wondering what to do.  I thought about sitting on it, but she was quite clear in her instructions: delete her account.  Karen had already run through the identity verification questions and had requested (demanded) a cancellation.  I took a backup of her account as insurance, and processed the termination.  I also created a ticket, with appropriate notes and emailing Karen to tell her that her termination request had been taken care of.

I went home not long after that, but the next day I came in to work and was immediately called in speak to manager.  It turned out that Karen was notorious for this shit - she'd demand we do things beyond our scope, and scream and cry and threaten until someone said ""Ok, we'll do it"".  She'd gotten used to other staff members doing whatever she demanded that she expected we bend over backwards.  If she ever heard the word ""no"" she'd threaten to cancel and go elsewhere.

It seemed that other reps had just fixed whatever problem in order to stop her tantrums and get rid of her.  I was the first in a long time to tell her no, and the only one who had ever followed through on actually terminating her account.

Manager: ""You're not in trouble, don't worry.  You did everything correctly.  I've had Karen on the phone all morning squawking about her website.  Oh, btw, did you happen to take a backup of her account?""

Me: ""Yep, it's on my computer""

Manager: ""Delete it and pretend it never existed""

And that's the story of how I destroyed Karen's business website.",7741,3,1
Why can't you help me print?!,"This was a few weeks ago, as many of my clients were beginning to work from home.

I received a call from a client, she was in no way a senior member of the company, just a typical employee who was working from home. She was connecting to a terminal server using RDP over a VPN to work.

She was frantic, like seemed almost panicked saying she couldn't print to her home printer. She was very angry and extremely rude demanding I fix this immediately. We'd provided her with a laptop to work from home which hadn't been configured to her home printer.

Our company policy considers allowing home kit such as printers that were not provided by us to be a change request, primarily because configuring unsupported kit is billable, so I passed the ticket to the relevant team to contact her management and approve 1. That she's allowed to print at home and 2. That they're willing to pay us to set it up.

She was very unhappy I wouldn't just 'make it work' and had that 'why can't you just fix it?' mentality. I explained to her it was policy and unfortunately I had to respect it as she respects her company policies, which she wasn't happy about but I think she realised she wasn't going to get anywhere arguing with me.

20 minutes later this woman calls back, saying being unable to print is completely stopping her from working. I was able to again appease her saying I'd see if there was an update and get back to her soon.

Typically a request like this takes at least a day to seek relevant approval from the client and to go through a proper process when coming from an employee and not someone in the company that has authority, although the delay is usually in hearing back from the client.

My manager called me shortly after the 2nd call and asked if she was being rude to me. Apparently the woman's manager had asked this question (I'd not mentioned anything). I explained it as I said here, perhaps downplayed slightly, she wasn't exactly pleasant or polite, but did seem quite frantic and blunt is what I said. He let me know he might have to pull the recording, I guess they'd had problems with her before.

I received a message from my manager saying the client has advised there's no reason this woman needs to print from home, and that her manager would speak to her directly and would let us know if they found a reason she'd need this.

2 days later she called back ""I found a workaround to my printing issue, I forward the documents (confidential business information) to my personal email and print them from my personal laptop, but the formatting is all wrong, why does it look weird when I print it? You need to fix this!"" Alarm bells go off in my head. ""I'll get a ticket raised for you and have an engineer call you back"" I say, pretending to be a call handler just to get her off the phone. I tell my manager what she told me. He was not impressed and said he'd take it up with the higher ups at the client company.

The next day I received her leaver form. Close account and access with immediate effect. Laptop to be posted back to us to be wiped.

No idea what was wrong with the formatting from her home laptop, or if she was deliberately trying to steal information or just being unbelievably negligent even after having it explained to her (apparently by both her and my manager) why this was bad. I'm just happy this Karen is no longer with the company.",361,0,1
You can't just use the information we already gave you!,"A small tale from my old workplace (It's my old workplace for one than one reason).

After suffering a minor data breach which involved a user (manager) entering all of their login details on a fake website (this is a whole other story maybe for another time) we decided to introduce a third party login authentication system as clearly an incompetent user would just bypass anything internal anyway. 

We opted for an app people can download on their phones and simply press accept when prompted to. In order to link the app to the database we just needed to enter their phone numbers, phone numbers and other personal data is already in the database and we have full access to as stated in the terms of employment. 

So I send out an email to ask people to confirm whether or not their phone numbers were still correct to we may proceed. 

Fast forward an hour I have been called into a meeting with the heads of department, they are angrily demanding to know how and why I have their and their department member's personal information. I explain what I have already explained in the above paragraphs.

&amp;#x200B;

No No No this is not good enough and we should explicitly hand out a permission form to each member of staff instead to ask for permission (again this is something we DO NOT need to do in this particular workplace). Reluctantly we agree and hand out the forms.

&amp;#x200B;

2 weeks later we have received 87 of the 400 ish forms we need to go ahead with the authentication system, we again email the staff explaining we need these. We receive about 20-30 more over the next few days.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll skip a few more back and forths between myself and the departments. So a month later the main manager of the orgnisation comes to the IT department, furious. ""IT WHAT AM I PAYING YOU FOR, WE APPROVED THE APP MONTHS AGO (it was a month) THAT IS ALREADY COSTING US A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE DOING NOTHING"" . I am very good at talking with people so the rest of the department usually just leave me to deal with the ""PR"" side of things, not this time chief. 

&amp;#x200B;

I lost the plot, simply said to him ""You can speak with the rest of the team and once you have realised how unprofessional both yourself and the other departments have been you can come back to me, I'm going for my break.""

&amp;#x200B;

The app was never implemented, I left soon after.",286,0,1
I Believe You Have My Email...,"This is from about 2005 or 2006.  We had a customer for our very small (think city wide \~ 300,000 in the city) ISP.  We get a call from a user who's username is let's say ""ignorant\_wanker"".  They were complaining that there was an somebody using the email address of [""ignorant\_wanker@aol.com](mailto:""ignorant_wanker@aol.com)"".  

They demanded we stop this other person from impersonating them.  We tried our best to explain that we have no control over other ISP's and you are allowed to use the same username at different domains for email addresses.  This person called back 3 or 4 times  and talked to several agents who all explained the same thing.

When the calls stopped, we all had a laugh and went on about our lives.  Afew days later, we started getting calls that users were getting bounce backs from AOL when they sent emails and they were being rejected.  


We contact AOL and find out that have black listed our domain because ignorant\_wanker, no happy with the explanation we gave them started emailing and harrassing [ignorant\_wanker@aol.com](mailto:ignorant_wanker@aol.com) demanding that they give up the email address.  This lead to AOL blocking domain and many many unhappy customers as AOL was still a player in the webmail scene.  


Finally AOL agrees to unblock us if we have a talk with our problem user and stop the abuse.  Turns out the VP of customer service and the legal counsel for the ISP had to call the customer to get things straightened out.  I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall.  I think the user terminated service either willingly or forcefully within a month.",195,0,1
Your licence is expired,"I work for a software development company. The software we make is free, but the content in it - books - are subscription based

Today I've got a message from my boss:  
B: *Hey, can you try and open a book on an iPad? It's article number is TH-123-ABC.*

TH stands for Thai-language book.

Me: *Sure.*

I grabbed an iPad, opened our software, logged in, searched for the book, it opened without a hitch.

Me: *It works, what's the problem?*  
B: *A client of ours subscribed for this book, but he's getting errors about expired licences.*  
Me: *Strange, but it works on my account*  
B: *Try a test account*

Yeah, good idea, mine is a company superaccount, has access to all the books. Took a dumb test login, subscribed for the book, and it opened.

Me: *Still works*

After a few other checks, tries and futile solutions, everything looked absolutely perfect. We even ask the customers' permission to try it with his account. He gave permission, I logged in, and the licence was valid on my computer. On his: expired.

I couldn't help much further, so I went on with my other tasks, while my boss tried to help the client. An hour later I've got a message from him:  
B: *I've got it. It turned out Thailand uses a different calendar. Currently it's year 2563. So his licence for the year 2020 DID expire. 500 years ago.*",3482,0,1
Can you fix crazy?,"TL;DR at bottom

I work the IT service desk at a medium size office complex.  We recently changed the vendor of our ticketing system and as such we also decided to change how users could submit tickets.  With the old system, the floor lead or supervisor of a department could submit a ticket on behalf of a user.  This was great because it prevented a lot of unnecessary tickets from being created.  One of our company values is discernment and management decided to allow all employees the power to make good judgement decisions by letting everyone submit their own tickets.  As such, my team and I have received some tickets that leave us rolling on the floor laughing and other tickets leave us asking ourselves “just... how...?”.  The following is one such fantastic nugget from an end user:

One day we were crunching the ticket queue and as I had finished with my current pile, I went out to the open queue for more tickets. I saw this one ticket titled “Can you fix crazy?”.  Intrigued, I clicked on it and read the body of the ticket.  It read as follows (and is formatted exactly how the user submitted it):

“I’m hearing sounds.

Dings.

Every time I back space too many times.

Help.”

That was the ticket. I just stared at my screen, stunned that this was actually a ticket. When I told my team that someone wanted us to fix crazy, my coworkers thought the same thing I did; that a user’s laptop was ‘acting crazy’ and they needed it fixed.  Then my teammates read the ticket and we all just stood around my workstation and busted up laughing for a moment.  As an aside, this ticket is one syllable away from a haiku and yes, we did take time to count the syllables. Our tier II wanted the ticket because he thought it was funny; I did not want the ticket because I thought it was petty so it worked out great. 

So you know that ding sound that Windows makes when you backspace too much? Well, I later learned that the user wanted that specific Windows sound to be turned off.  However, she wanted the rest of the Windows sounds to be left on.  The best my coworker could come up with was to turn off the Windows alerts that corresponded with that sound; it would turn off the backspace ding as well a few other benign ID10T alert dings. I’m told she didn’t like that answer and demanded another technician. She literally told my coworker, tier II A, “I’m done with you”.  The other tier II we have is very nice but his troubleshooting skills are somewhat lacking; I’m told he actually got promoted out of pity.  Anyway, she wanted tier II B to fix her issue, so off it went to tier II B.  He essentially did what tier II A was planning to do and told her the exact same thing that tier II A did.  She was still huffy but since the answer to the fix was consistent, she reluctantly agreed. To date, I haven’t heard anything more about it so I’m guessing that all is well that ends well.

The moral of the story: no, you cannot fix crazy.

TL;DR: User submitted a ticket in the form of an almost-haiku requesting a specific sound setting that is native to Windows to be turned off while leaving the rest of the Windows sounds turned on.  The “fix” was to turn off the sound alerts that corresponded with the specific sound.  The user didn’t like the “fix”, pitched a fit, and finally relented to the “fix”. And to answer the question in the title, no, you cannot fix crazy.",360,0,1
Clients are their own worst enemies.,"This feels like something every IT person can get a good groan out of, so here goes.

About three years ago now, I was working for a MSP. Most of our clients were health professionals of some sort or another. There's a whole slew of stories I could tell about that, but the one that takes the cake is one I wasn't even witness to.

Basically, one of the dentists who we provided services for was having an issue with a server we installed. Everyone but the boss was already out or otherwise spoken for, so the boss saddles up to go take care of things. When he arrives in the server room, he finds the client standing there, having apparently just straight-up unplugged the server.

""I just wanted to speed things up.""

Anyway. Boss got it fixed, but anyone who says the customer is always right has never worked IT or retail. ",203,0,1

I'm a corporate developer i know what im talking about,"Hi, This is another story about working Tech Support for a large retail company. 

Backstory: A customer who said he works for the major corporate office of the product we sale/repair. Was having an issue with his phone's OS and demanded a replacement. He'd also would like to transfer 100% of everything from one phone to the replacement (documents, pictures AND the corrupted OS).  The thing is, if you have bad software and you mirror it from a bad backup and put it onto the replacement, its going to continue with that same problem from the previous device.

I'd also would like to add this the original problem was on his corporate phone (A prototype) and the main corporate office has their own, separate repairs for HQ employees only. But he came to public retail.

&amp;#x200B;

Me: Good afternoon! I will be your technician today. How may i assist you.

Customer: Yeah my phone would force reboot after every 2 hours or so.

Me: I see, what activity is your device doing before it restarts?

Customer: If i run (presentation app) or play (High Performed Game). Hell if i just sit here watching a movie it shuts down.

Me: I see. Have you tried anything on your own before making an appointment? (Just so i don't repeat his steps)

Customer: Only thing i could think of is reinstall the applications but it still restarts. I'm fairly certain its the phone and not the applications. I had it replaced by another one of your stores last week. I'll just have you guy's replace it again. It should be under warranty.

Me: Alright sir. Before we can come to the conclusion of a full unit replacement, i would need to run some tests for the best approach.  


I look into our database based on his name, device serial and so on. The device was in fact replaced the week before coming to us. However, the original he took to the first store had an unusual barcode that i have never seen before. I speak to a manager for guidance. He says, ""Thats a prototype"" and was already replaced from another store in another city.

&amp;#x200B;

The damaged OS however could be traced to the Analytics Data. This will be transferred to any new phone and recreate the issue if he copies everything from his backup to the new phone. We did not have the tools or training to make changes in the Data. Most retail doesn't. Only solution is to start from scratch on a new OS and transfer all info excluding the copied OS. (My explanations are terrible in this context but he can transfer his data separate from the OS) 

I return back to the customer.

Me: Hello Sir, It looks like the first device replaced  was a prototype. If you don't mind me asking. Where did you get this.

Customer: I work in (My companies) corporate office and they have issued me this device.

(Might i add i hear loads of stories that the corporate employees treat the retail of the same company like lower peasants)

&amp;#x200B;

Me: I see. I do know that corporate has a separate repair group that could have repair or replace that system for issues like this. 

Customer: I know but i was not in the area so i just went to the closest store i could find.

Our other stores could have prevented this. But again he goes to the closest store to him. Our hardware scans show that none of the hardware is the issue. No over heating, no damaged components/water damage. Clean as its new hardware.

Me: From the results of diagnostics, it seems this is a software issue not a hardware. Also from the back logs, it shows theres corrupt files in the operating system. Did you do a full backup and restore from the prototype to the replacement?

Customer: Yes, its not the software i know its the hardware.

I try to explain to him for a bit but he does not want to hear it. I then give him the solution that will work.

Me: Ok so our database is pointing to an out of store repair. This will take a few business days to continue diagnosing to see if this is really hardware. But a faster solution for you would be to restart the OS from scratch. You CAN backup and transfer documents, pictures, music and so on and have it all on a non corrupted OS.

Customer: Absolutely not! I need everything on this phone brought to a new phone. I'm a developer, i work at corporate. I would know if it was a programming error! Just get me a manager.

I go and speak to a manager but he is tied up with several customers who need help. He then adds his permissions to bypass the out of store repair and to just replace his phone (for the second time in a week)

Me: Hi. Unfortunately our managers are busy but we have redirected our data to replace your phone as its still under warranty.

Customer: You should have got that done in the first five minutes of talking to me. This is why im in corporate. I know what im talking about.

After i heard that i was feeling a little discouraged as i was trying to get into corporate for 6 months before trying my hand in the retail side. I also didn't believe corporate employees would treat the retail side any different.

Me: Please wait as we bring out your replacement phone.

His OS is fully backed up on the network server. I replace his phone.

Me: Here you go sir. Would you need assistance transferring your previous data to the new phone?

Customer: No i know what to do. Just put my sim card in the new phone.

I do ask he says but issue a last minute comment.

Me: Ok here you go sir. I just would like to remind you, if the same issue happens again, it points to your OS and not the hardware.

Customer: I'm a developer, i know im right.

He leaves and i continue working.

The next day he comes in for the same problem and demands another replacement. I was already in a semi bad mood and didn't want to be stepped on by a customer that day. Before i approached him. I looked at his appointments description.. it was the same problem from yesterday. I asked my manager if we should replace his phone again. He said no and his only options (because it was replaced twice in one week) Is to have a new OS installed, or go a week without his phone as it would need to be sent out for inspection.

I walk to him and start off with a cheery tone.

Me: Welcome i'll be your technician today. What can i do for..

Customer: Yeah yeah you gave me a broken phone. Its the same problem. I want this fixed and i want it done right. Give me a fully working phone.

I took a shot and looked at him with the most serious face and tone i've ever done in my life during a confrontation.

Me: Sir, do you remember me from yesterday?

Customer: Yeah so what?

Me: Do you remember what i said?

Customer: Yeah but i help create this OS i know im right.

Me: Again, do you remember what i said about your corrupted OS?

Customer: Its not corrupted.

Me: Sir, we can give you another never removed from box phone like the first two times. Please understand this is a software issue. If you'd like i can transfer all your data to a known working OS and you can test it in our store (He has free time).

I guess my tone made him agree to test my theory. We transfer all his data to a clean new OS. He stays in the store for two hours as i help other customers. While i finish up another customer i check in with him.

Me: Hello any updates?

Customer: It hasn't rebooted yet. I'm testing everything and making sure i have all my data.

Me: Sounds good. I'll check back in half an hour.

I come back before taking my scheduled break.

Customer: Ok its not doing it but it was random before you replaced it. I need to go but i'll be back when it happens.

Customer walked out and i told my manager the encounter. My manager said with the comments he gave about working in corporate, we could have gotten his employee number and reported him to his corporate manager. Unfortunately i didn't ask for his employee number.

He came back weeks later but with another phone. I wasn't working on it but another tech said it was for another situation (He dropped it in a kitchen sink) but my coworker said the customer was talking about me to him and said. ""Yeah i was here before. He fixed my other phone a while ago""

I guess it was the OS.",187,0,1
"""How did my contract details get on this website?"".... It's a google prefill","So I am the youngest person at my work and somehow I have become the tech support skivvy because I have basic computer skills and everyone else seems to be afraid of technology. It's super weird and frustrating, but I try to be as helpful as possible.

This morning I get sent a photo of a web page with this message from B:
""Hey DarlazMIRS, I logged into random sales site this morning and this product belongs to XYZ Sales person. Yet I see my personal contact details are listed on the site. Do you know why that is?""

I look at the photo and see that the item is listed for sale with the contact details of the seller on it. Below it is a ""Contact Me!"" request form, one where you submit your details and the seller calls you back. This is filled with the persons personal information. So just from looking at this, I can't see an issue.

I call the person up to try help.

""Hey there B! I dont understand what the issue is with your question.""

""DarlazMIRS! Thank god. So I'm looking at this site and for some reason my contract details are listed as the seller. But I'm not selling this product!""

""But you aren't listed as the seller...""

""No. Have a look at my photo. All my details are there.""

""Okay.... have you bought something off this site before?""

He pauses. ""Yeah.""

""Okay. So Google saved you information and has prefilled the form for you to contact the seller directly.""

""Really?"" He thinks about it. ""Google can do that?""

And on that magical day, people learned something new about the internet.

TL:DR Google prefilled in some personal information on a sales site contact request form; now person is worried they will be contacted for the product that is on sale.

*Update* This happened a second time with another sales person this week...",585,0,1
No ma'am I cant turn that off...,"I work as a printer technician, but specifically on connecting customers to a printer or help set them on to scan to email. 

This customer recently had their email server compromised and needed to update their password in their copier so they could scan to email.  Basically, I asked if I could remote into her computer so i could do it from her computer (so someone wouldn't have to head over, changing this call from $45 to $100 for milage).  The website was being blocked by her IT. Well not much I cam do but she asks me If I can disable it or tell her how to disable it.  I know I can't and wont do that without their ITs permission so I ask if she can call her IT to get it approved.  

She responds with ""Are you sure you dont know anyways to disable the security on my computer?  If you were with another customer and they had a popup blocker you would have no way to turn it off?""

At this point I feel I can tell how their email server was compromised, but ignoring that, I responded with ""There is no way I am able to disable the security on her computer without ITs permission""  

She sighed and finally called IT, and they let me remote in and out took 10 minutes to actually fix the problem.  Hopefully I wont have to deal with them again for the next week or so...",1310,0,1
Tycho Electric Anomaly,"Thirty-nine years ago I did telephone tech support for a computer hardware company in San Diego. (Never did on-site visits except for one odd situation that I'll post about another day.)  We made controller boards to connect minicomputers to printers. I was learning on the job do I kept a detailed card file of each user's symptoms and ultimate resolution, so that over time I evolved a paper database of problems mated with solutions.

One of our customers called me because their board had arrived and a physical inspection revealed damage.  I asked  what kind of damage.  He explained it looked like one of the components exploded.  Now that board was working the last time I saw it, so something must have happened in transit.  We sent him a replacement and he shipped the damaged board back.  Customer was happy.

But we were still out the cost of a new board, around $1500 if I recall.  When the damaged board arrived it looked like a crater on the moon.  The component that exploded was a large capacitor.  Almost nothing was left of it.  Burn marks covered most of the board radiating out from the capacitor's location.

We had to badger the shipper for a few days before they admitted that the delivery truck was struck by lightning.  The driver was unharmed so they assumed the cargo was okay too.  We filed a claim and got reimbursed.

As for the board, the director of manufacturing hung it on the wall of the factory.  Every time he gave a tour he told the story.",401,0,1
