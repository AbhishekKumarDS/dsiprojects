Your Son is Seven and He's Getting WHAT?,"So last night I had a very bizarre call from someone with a foreign accent, possibly Indian or middle Eastern. I'm shit at recognizing accents so don't judge me. 

The guy was just asking where the bank closest to him was located. He provided a ZIP code (odd, but ok) so I found a couple of options for him. He also asked how I was doing a few times and when I asked him the same, the conversation took a turn I wasn't expecting. Without further ado... 

Me: I'm doing well, thank you. How are you? 

Caller: Oh, I'm very good, the doctor my family goes to will be open for the first time in two months. 

Me: That sounds great! 

Caller: Yes, yes, my son is going to have surgery and I am quite worried about him. 

Me: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sure he'll be fine though! 

Caller: The doctor said it will be a very painful procedure. My son is seven years old and he is going to be circumcised. 

Me: ... 

Me: Oh ok, well is there anything else I can help you with tonight? 

Him: That is all, thank you very much for your help. 

I was shook. Who says that to a bank rep? The whole call was odd, he could have searched for a bank himself.

No. You don’t get to speak to a manager.,"So I had this call from a third party, which is nothing new. Happens at least 40 times a day. But oh she has to make my job difficult 

DB = dumb bitch
SB = stupid bitch (the third party)
Me = my sorry ass 

Me: thank you for calling asshole company my name is apples who do I have the pleasure of speaking with. 

SB: yes this is Stupid Bitch, I’m calling on behalf of Dumb bitch. 

Me: alright is the member available to give me permission to speak with you? 

That’s usually the easiest way to get verbal authorization, speaking to the member. Because I work for a third party vendor we have to call the plan in order to confirm third party authorizations. 

SB: no he’s not but I do all the ordering

Me: *inwardly sighing* alright *gathers client PHI* now let me confirm with member services that we can speak with you. 

So I call over and shocker she’s not listed on the account. Who would have thought. 

Me: I’m very sorry Stupid Bitch, but you are not listed as an authorized third party for Dumb bitch. Is dumb bitch available for me to get permission to speak with you? 

SB: NO they’re not!! I just want to place an order! I always do it! Check the account! I’m always the one and they always do it for me!

Me: I’m very sorry Stupid bitch but I cannot access the account unless you’re authorized to speak on the members behalf. If they’re not available to give permission, you can use our website assholecompany.com to place an order, or you can call back at a later time when they are available. 

SB: No I’m not using the fucking website! I WaNt A mAnAgEr NoW!!!!

Now we cannot transfer people if we have not verified an account to a manager. It’s company policy. 

Me: I’m very sorry Stupid bitch but I’m unable to transfer you to a manager until we get you verified. Unfortunately as you stated the me- 

SB: -rudely interrupting with screaming, no real words, just screaming- 

Me: *putting them on mute and taking off my headset to play stardew valley while they go off on a tirade*

Sb: eventually calms down- HeLlO hElLo!!!

Me: yes ma’am I’m still here. Again I cannot transfer you to a manager without you being authorized. I hope you have a wonderful day. *click*",755,0,0,"No. You don’t get to speak to a manager.

Let me vent to you about a dumb call I had today,"So I am a team leader. We will call the customer Stupid Ahole or SA for short. 

I get this escalated call - will cut out some because it was 20 minutes long before I finally ended it. 

ME: so I spoke with my staff and understand that you have some concerns about an invoice you received?

SA: NO! Actually that is not correct at all!! There was a security breach on my account and you gave my information to some random person who is not on my account and now you are calling me to collect on an invoice for a service you gave to someone else!!!

Looking over the account for 2 mins.

ME: Okay I do see that there was an administrative error on your account and a service was opened on your account in error. I do apologize and I will have that fixed so that it never happens again, however, there was no information breach - no one provided someone else with your personal information at any time. 

It goes on like this for sometime and turns out this happened once before and wasn't fixed...

SA: I should tell you that I am recording this call. Do you know who I spoke to last time? 

Literally don't care at all that I'm being recorded because it doesn't change anything about how I will treat him. 

ME: No problem. I can pull the call recording and then call you back with that information. 

SA: Okay. 

ME: Alright I can call you back in about 20 minutes and let you know. 

SA: No. That's okay I will wait on hold. 

ME: Okay no problem. I will be back as soon as possible. 

So I try to pull the recording and I can't find it because it turns out it was for another department - the department who's managers decided that they don't have to make call logs or notate customer's accounts. 

ME: Okay I looked for that call and was unable to find it with the phone number provided. Is there another number you could have called us from? 

SA: No that has been my number for the last 7 years. 

ME: Okay well I can have our IT department look into this further and retrieve the recording and get back to you tomorrow or on Monday. 

SA: Would you like me to tell you who I talked to? 

ME: ... sure? 

SA: Are you sure? 

ME: You can tell me who you spoke to if you wish. 

SA: It was N\*\*\*. 

ME: Okay and what would you like to discuss regarding that call? 

SA: Are you kidding me?!?!?!? Do you know how stupid and illogical you sound?!!?!?!? Why do I have to tell your company who I spoke to last? You should have all this information. 

I am internally sighing here because I know N\*\*\* is from the department that doesn't make notes that caused this error in the first place and not from my department that actually makes notes and gets shit on all day. 

ME: Sir. I would have found this information for you and provided it to you on Friday or on Monday. You chose to tell me the information right now. That does not mean that I was unable to find it. 

This goes on again for some time close to 20 minutes with him being increasingly condescending and rude towards me. 

SA: You breached my security! I want you to let me out of this agreement so I never have to deal with f\*\*\*ing company again. 

ME: I do apologize sir, however, I am not going to approve to waive your entire contract due to a simple admin error. I promise that this will be fixed and I am so sure that it will never happen again that I will send you an email so you have it in writing that we will waive your contract if this ever happens again. 

SA: You promise me??? I'm not your boyfriend! This is a business! Your promises mean nothing! Cancel my f\*\*\*ing agreement. I am going to go online and write about this horrible experience anywhere I can!

ME: Sir, we are having the same conversation over and over. Everything that needs to be said has been said. You can call it a commitment or whatever you like. We have discussed the resolution I have provided in this matter (customer interrupts me)

SA: What resolution is that?!?!?!?

ME: (very calmly) I have already told you several times which resolution I will provide. You may proceed however you like as well. I will also send you an email with a summary of this discussion. 

SA: Fine! I will slander your company all over the internet. 

ME: Okay sir, is there anything else I can help you with today? 

SA: No, thank you.

I couldn't help but feel racist when I had to tell a women I can't transfer her and lie that we had no-one here who spoke spanish who could help her.  I hate this."

The cast

Me as myself
AL as angry Lady.

Place A - A company that works with recycling products for money. They will give you credit for items directly when you buy products. Pretty sweet and super instant on your bill as long as you mail it in ASAP and don’t play the system.

Place B - Our stores, and technically where I work, but the stores and the call centers can’t touch each other’s stuff and anything you do in person at a store, we can’t see or help you with.



I’ve worked tech support for my company variously for over six years and moved to a post sales position due to corona and the insane things people think is okay to do to their electronics. I still get crazy calls but I don’t have to share screens or sell anything so I’m peachy, and a little less stressed but the stupid and self entitled people do not make life any easier.



So today the angry lady calls in with the bankcard on the line with her. Okay. We don’t normally do things this way. She was super upset/mad because we took back a credit for a computer she did not trade in correctly yet “check the recorded calls you all said it would be fine.” (She turned it in at Place B and got instant credit instead of mailing it in to Place A like she was supposed to.) She started off at a pre-screech levels of half yelling into my ears and this progressively got louder as she huffed and complained and explained the situation. And also telling me to check prior calls is like asking a rock to roll over. Not happening. Can’t do it. I’m not management.

The store (Place B) gave her the credit and she applied it to her bank card and boom, she now has that instant credit for let’s say 100 dollars on top of the credit from Place A. Now the Place A she was supposed to mail her computer to charged her back for the money and the cost of the prepaid shipment box. $118.55. She’s livid and I offer her $20 to offset the shipping charge cause I’m nice. I’ll try to do a good thing. And she isn’t too bad yet.

The silence for ten seconds then it happens, she inhaled and I hadn’t braced myself.

AL went ballistic on me, full Karen and asked for a manager. Screaming about everything. The callback time for a manager in MY department is 9 to 11 full days on a good week. This was explained thoroughly and she demanded I still try to call one now with her son egging her on in the background. Whatever. Let’s waste our time. I still get paid because you’re being rude.

I do the whole call over to a manager, check in every two minutes, wait ten minutes in total, make huge notes and a callback request, come back and tell her what’s next.

AL: “I WORK CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I KNOW HOW IT WORKS GO SEE IF YOU HAVE MANAGER NOW.”

I check it’s at 15 minutes hold now for a manager and no ones there but waiting music, come back explain again they will call her back in 9 days and she flips again. I advise I can check one more time but then I have to release the call. She agrees. I check and come back.

AL: “This is just not how you promote good customer service, why can I get a manager so much faster usually with you assholes?”

Me:  “Well usually when you call tech support you can get a manager in three to ten minutes depending on the day and the call volume. That’s super easy. Over here on my side of things here at ‘Place B’ and there are just so many calls we have this procedure in place to get things in order, have well detailed notes on your account, and our managers will usually go above and beyond to help you given the chance. But depending on the call or notes depends on how much we can do.”

She goes silent then asks me to check one more time for a manager, a little nicer this time, I oblige, then come back and she then rants about how she isn’t paying her bill and wants all the interest credited to her and is in general belligerent to a point. I let her rant, then advise I will check on the line one more time, still stuck in hold music hell, and then advise we will call her back. In. Nine. Days. She finally gave up but honestly… she didn’t see her error.


She got instant money at a store for her item.

She did not mail it in as was the original procedure.

The store did not mail it in, they just instant credited her and said it would be fine.

She applied instant credit to her card which made her total amount so much smaller and seem like a great deal.

She fucked up.

She can’t do the math of get a credit at Place B, then Place A will recharge their amount back. As it was an instant credit on the order and they have every right to.

Often that means a Lot of sweet words and overthink every Word to convince the  2nd level that thats the right joice.
And only if this went well, the Call Hand over to 2nd Personal so i Not in direct contact anyone from this Case.

So today I get a Call from the Son of a customer who are a many years with us and also have a Lot of Contracts. After we Check up the formalities wich allows me to get Information too  the Son, who are Not the owner of  any contract under this Customer Profil, He explaind the reason for his Call. 
It was about a very very high Bill arrived these days wich he just can't explain how it comes to this. 
So I began to Go the same way i every pick to Start process a Bill request every day.
I lead the customer step by Step to every point of his Bill and explain things if they could be from interest or help as in anyway to get things clear and find a Solutions. After a few Pages of Not realy strange or help full Details I finaly found the evil thing that raised the Bill in this unbelivebel amount.
Like so often it is one of the simples things that just didn't came in the Customers mind what brings them in Financial difficulties. Often they realy get heavy afraid if something like that happens and they know can't pay the Bills as normal. 
So it also was in this Case. After i explain that he use a Function that is not in the booked service and also not get calculated in a low Status because of his location at the Time of useing which also means i can't answer the questions of what tariff the calculat based he explain to, that he just can't pay this Bill and ask me to find a Solutions.
I try to calm him down and make sure that there is always a Solutions especialy when the contact Starts so close to the appearance of the Problem. While i do this already Start to Check what i needs to push a installment payment without Problems, the most things i head in my head all the Time but the list is very long and chance sometimes.
After i figuerd out if there is a Chance to get this Solution, i opened it to the costomer and explain the one thing we have to Switch. 

It was a realy simple and Quick to Change when ever hes ready and after the Bill is complitly payed. 
He just had to give me the right to take back his termination for now. Also explain that he can reverse it after everything is done and payed.

I startet the next Step already and just had to push the botton which connect  me with 2nd in the background while the customer listen to some fancy music till 2nd takes the Call and i can close the Case for  me.

But than the customer began to think about what happens when the contract stays. 
With the Start of the first sentense from him I was close to think that he make a Bad joke with me.. But he realy ask me why he have to pay the Bill in steps every month and also have to pay the Contract. Befor i was able to Start an explain he contunue to ask me if this is realy the only offer i had for him, for him the so long customer. I answer that this is realy the only Chance  for we have to make the wight of the Bill softer and easyer to handle, so he had not to pay the whole big thing at once. I startet friendly and with the nicest voice i had to explain that there a no ways  to deleted the Bill in some way  because it wasn't the fault of our Firma. 
Its fact that we realy explain more than once while the Contract running what the Service has in and what does cost more and espacially things like his because there are other prices in other locations  we just didn't know or can Control  as long as the costumor books  a Option that are made for These Situations.

But it was to late.. my words didn't get to the costumor. And after he shoutet out how to the World how completely incompetent I am and obously my Firma he end  his explanaition about the way he see  us now he end with the words  that because of that he now cancel every Single Contract he has with us. 
And befor i had the Moment to make sure that he know that in this way he had to pay the whole Bill what could be bring him more in a Bad Situation with money as it could when he just had to pay the price of the Service for few months. And i promise, it was the smallest price you can get for a Service in our whole assortment.  
This Service to this prices didn't even exsist  anymore 
But he cancel the Call and gave me no Change to bring him to a lower  level of angry so Yeah i think thats it.

For the Post  processing  i Check the System to See if there is anything to See already about the payment 
And yes money ist gone away while he prefers to shout at me for helping.",15,0,0,"No Sir, I'm Sorry but I can't set your Bill to 0 because the big number you see has reach so high because you use a thing wich is clearly define on your Contract as expensiv and not free.

Well...I dodged that last bullet,"Back in 2013 my boyend and I had just moved to the Bay Area and I was desperate for work so I could help with rent and bills so that my boyfriend Bubbles and his long time friend didn't have to foot the entire bill between them on their social security. For a while I worked for a MLM who I made feel bad for what they fully intended to do  to me and I was terminated in the kindest and most understanding way you can imagine before I found a job at a call center.

It was one of those places that sold overpriced tubs for seniors with lights and jets and I was upfront that I wasn't interested if there was no base pay which they assured me there was and so I was hired pretty much on the spot since the turnover rate at those places is notoriously high. As I was given the tour I noticed a pizza party in the break room and the smell of cheap coffee was strong but I thought nothing of it as they were mentioned as a benefit for employees.

Training was short and I really wanted to work hard to go from the cold call floor to the warm call floor. I was familiar with the program being used and didn't need any accommodations to do what I needed to do. The script was dry, we weren't really told much on how to encourage people to accept having a consultant in the house other than the usual and certainly we were told nothing about which healthcare programs may help support the cost of the merchandise.  I found out several things quickly.

The pizza was a lie. the supervisors started friendly 'competitions' for their teams so that during a one or two hour period the team that set up the most appointments would get a $5 Little Ceasars pizza to share in victory but for the 4 months I worked there the only pizza I saw was during my interview and apparently only because the entire floor badgered the supervisors to put up or shut up.

Coffee was only served once a day strategically between agents breaks so that only the receptionists and Supervisors could get it but we all faked needing to pee to have some of the only good thing about this place. We had our own cups that we were suppose to keep in our lockers in the hall way outside the production floor but it was an unsaid rule for agents to sit with their empty cups between their legs until we smelled the coffee and then the race of management VS agents was on.

They disabled our ability to mark numbers that were on the DNC registry and set it up in the system so that instead of being removed from solicitations permanently, they were removed for only a month which constitutes as harassment in this state so over half the calls I took were irate senors who legitimately had a beef with the company and wanted the calls to stop.  I felt terribly for these people and came to recognize a few numbers on sight which I immediately marked DNC to save them slight hassle.

Unhappy that some customers were locking the consultants out of the house after setting up appointments, management reduced bonuses from setting up any kind of appointment to only for confirmed appointments. They also tried to crack down on us getting coffee but one of the guys pissed at his station and said they couldn't restrict our right to use the bathrooms when needed. Gross, but effective. We weren't threatened for termination when we wanted to change feminine products or use the can. I guess the reduction of bonuses made sense but I never did figure out why they tried to restrict coffee as a management only privilege when they pointed it out as a benefit for all employees on site during interviews and training.

Into my third month there things got weirder. Management tried to keep us from using the bathrooms on site and tried to say that we would have to walk or drive down the road to the gas station during our lunch or breaks as we were going to be locked out of the bathrooms on the first floor. That only the owners and managers were allowed to use the ones on the second floor after an incident involving a toilet paper roll being set on fire in the mens' room that no one owned up to. One of the gals brought up that this was a violation of  the law and that if they didn't want to have OSHA taking up residence in their butts they'd rethink this course of action.  The bathrooms were unlocked after a day.

There use to be a fridge we could put our lunches in though I never used it because of obligatory food thieves but apparently at this time Management was trying to cut costs where they could.  I never figured out if this part was true but I can't outright say it's a lie as I know some of my co workers did have green cards. Apparently a manager found drug paraphernalia in the back of the freezer and that lost us the privilege of using the fridge for our perishables. They taped the fridge shut with painters tape and unplugged it. The paraphernalia wasn't related to anything the green cards applied to so it was either a lie fabricated to justify cutting costs or someone was indeed being very dumb.

Into the fourth month management or the owners had another grand idea, that we had to get a confirmed appointment every hour or we would be sent home despite us rehashing old number's and having harassed many of the people we called for months about trying to order overpriced equipment under the guise of senior aid.  The supervisors still tried to get us to play their games with the promise of cheap pizza but if we weren't impressed with their failure to deliver before we certainly were underwhelmed now that our pay was being impacted.

I got sent home early for a week before I was finally ticked off at the BS at work I handed in my two week notice and counted the days as the floor 'supervisors' tried to whip the agents into a frenzy to schedule appointments. Every day they'd loose people on the floor and try to calling people from the evening shift to fill in for the gaping holes in the morning shifts, and then they'd expect the evening shift to come in for their scheduled times to work for presumably the same hourly requirement or they get sent home early as well.

Three days from supreme happiness I looked at the schedule and saw that these sorry excuses for bosses had scheduled me and I went to HR to tell them that they'd have to revise this schedule as I wouldn't be in next week. When they tried to explain that I hadn't worked long enough to get FMLA I told them that I'd turned in my two weeks notice and I wasn't going to be in, ever, after this week. The flaccid toad's mouth gaped like a fish as I turned and went back to my station for another hour until I was sent home.

After I left I didn't even wait before I got back into the job hunt but I did text a few of my workmates and months later I ran into one who shared the ultimate fate of that place. Apparently a month after I left everyone who still worked there turned up and the doors were locked, it was no surprise the supervisors were usually late at the end except that this time the feds had showed up to pack all the employees up for questioning.

The owners had somehow gotten wind and refused their employees entry to the site as they bailed and even the employees who'd been fired in the past month had also been rounded up. I was just outside the bracket so I wasn't herded in but wow that place was a hole. Just how much of a scumbag do you have to be as a business owner to actually get the feds to roll in to hunt you down and leave your underlings to hold the bag?",355,0,0,"Well...I dodged that last bullet Back in 2013 my boyend and I had just moved to the Bay Area and I was desperate for work so I could help with rent and bills so that my boyfriend Bubbles and his long time friend didn't have to foot the entire bill between them on their social security.

"Once again, I have no control of this pandemic you consider “bullshit”","I work in a call center for a popular exercise equipment brand that’s commonly advertised toward wealthy people.

I had a customer call in today very very audibly angry because his products delivery has been pushed off, again, due to Covid. Specifically, an entire warehouse has to shut down for a few weeks to clean and for the staff that work there to quarantine, recover, and then get retested.

I looked up his order. I confirmed that, yes, it has been pushed back. Very likely because of Covid. He says, “I’ve been waiting for 4 weeks!!.” I tell him in some places of the country we are seeing wait times as long as 12 weeks because of demand skyrocketing with people having to stay at home and because of Covid-related issued. 

This dude just went off the rails lol. I was prepared to give him a partial refund for the inconvenience but he kept talking over me. Talking became yelling until finally when I say something along the lines of, “we are obligated to keeping our staff as well as other customers healthy” and he just goes “I’m TIRED of this Covid bullshit! It’s all bullshit!” 

So I hung up lol. And it felt great. It felt great confidently saying, “alright, I’m hanging up now. Have a great day” and hearing him yell “NO you WON’T” before hitting that pretty lil red button after being cut off and talked over so much. This grown ass man was throwing a tantrum like a child.

I don’t know how your customers are handling this pandemic and the effects it is having on certain products, but ours are losing it. I wish I could confidently tell people, “fuck, if it’s that bad and you’re that tired of waiting and you’re THAT insistent on buying another brand product that you SWEAR will be delivered faster, just do it. Cancel the order. I don’t care.”

I recently posted here about hanging up on another customer and got a ton of good advice about it. Luckily though, it appears in my particular call center if they start using profanity I have every ability to hang up on them. It’s encouraged we try to deescalate them but I used my sweetest, most empathetic customer service throughout the entire duration of the call and he only got worse so I knew that wouldn’t have been an option. My contract with this particular company ends December 15th and I’m very very eager to be done with them and their ungrateful customers. If I have the option to renew I intend on working only part time for them and part time with another company because the pay is unfortunately a lot better than most other client companies currently being offered in my call center. 

How have your calls changed with Covid numbers rising? Have your customers relaxed or became more aggressive? Are you lucky enough that there’s not been much of a change at all? 

Again thank you to anyone who gave me amazing advice on my last post!! You all have been my backbone in this new world of call center working I’ve entered since losing my job due to Covid back in March and I’m extremely grateful.",22,0,0,"Once again, I have no control of this pandemic you consider “bullshit” I work in a call center for a popular exercise equipment brand that’s commonly advertised toward wealthy people.

Me: (*assure statement, the usual shit*) My first concern is if it's hot enough to cause injury or damage to objects around it?

Cx: It's burned my hand on multiple occasions.

Me: (*we have keywords to look for with regards to Safety escalations and ""burn"" is one of them; safety team is available only on phone support*) For your safety, I highly urge you to disconnect the phone from power and do not use the phone until the issue is resolved. Because we care about our customers and would prefer you use our products without damage to your well-being, I'd have to get you acquainted with our Safety team — exclusively available over phones. (*requests details for callback*)

Cx: No, this is the only phone I have.

Me: I know it's inconvenient, but we really just want to avoid accidents, specially after how you described it.

Cx: I can't use other phones.

Me: You can plug the SIM to a friend or relative's phone and contact us from there.

Cx: I live alone.

Me: I'm sure you can talk to a friend or relative and make arrangements. I really do not want the phone exploding — it is likely to happen, given the description — and you losing a hand or worse. I hope you understand.

Cx: Can I go to a repair center? This isn't helping.

Me: I honestly can't guarantee if that works because it's the safety team who normally calls the shots. (*honestly this works, did it to please QA though*) If you want, I can talk to a senior and discuss alternative options, if there are any that's beyond my authority.

Cx: Ok.

Me: (*contacts senior via chat, senior gives the go signal to offer service options, but suggests we try their work number first*)

Me: Thanks for waiting. Any chance we can reach you through your work/office hotline? 

Cx: I don't want to, I'm busy during work. How do I get my phone fixed, it heats up. (Side note: this is so fucking weird since I get a lot of customers like these who are so out of tune in that they are describing the issue again in the middle of chat as if I didn't knew their issue already)

Me: Okay, good news is my senior has given the go signal to arrange service. 

(*I list their options*)

Cx: Okay, how much would this cost?

Me: (*gives cost estimates as per website pricing*) Though it's more accurate to ask the technician, they'll tell you of pricing after inspection. But, it's somewhere around that amount.

Cx: I have to pay?

Me: Friendly reminder it's out of warranty, so yes expect to shoulder associated costs.

Cx: Nevermind I'll just use the phone

Me: We really do not recommend that at all, for health and safety. I know it's a challenging scenario, but surely that's not worthy of gambling losing a hand or worse, if I'm being honest here.

When the customer gets mad at you for giving you the wrong information to research,"And think it’s your fault anyway. A customer of mine was trying to purchase a product but gave me the wrong zip code, so when I told her the store she was referring to had 0 in stock, she tore me a new one, saying that another source told her they had 12 in stock and demanded to know why she was lied to. Finally I had to research the city/state she was referring to and yup, she totally botched the zip by 3 digits. Once I confirmed the correct quantity, she goes “now, was that so hard?”

I wanted to scream, “Yes because you’re a fucking moron!”

But I need this job. So in my warmest, most gag-worthy customer service voice “I apologize ma’am, are there any other questions I can help you answer today?”

“Not if it’s gonna take as long as you did, no.”

“Have a good day,” is now my equivalent to “go fuck yourself.”

This is one of the main reasons I hate working in the retention department.,"I hate this job with a burning passion. Every call it’s the same thing and you have to fight tooth and nail to talk customers who don’t want their expensive into staying and when you have to cancel you get hit on your performance and you smooth talk them into staying and they call back to cancel, you still get hit. It’s bull. 

Fast forward to one of my calls. I had a call from the account holder’s daughter who said that she called in June to cancel her parents’ service because both of her parents died of Covid-19. Lo and behold, her TV, internet and phone service is still active. The account had an imprint of the retention rep who pulled up the account and had his name and employee number but he left no notes on the account. The date matches the date which she initially called. Guess who has to cancel. The person unfortunate enough to take the call and get a hit because some moron wanted to avoid getting a hit. The service added up to $320 a month. Customer was auto charged every month. And this is almost 6 months of service. You do the math. Customer demanded a refund as this was being taken out of her estate. There was no way management would approve an $1800 credit so I had to reverse as many charges as I could to get their money back. 

In these situations if the representative was caught he would get a final for his first offense and terminated on the second offense. Here’s the worst part. He’s in our call center, so we are not allowed to report him. So for now they let him get away with screwing me over and the customer over. 

I get these calls at least twice a week now in the Covid era from people in our call center. If you so much as mention that the account holder is dead then they won’t cancel the account because “the dead won’t know”. It’s effed up.

Regular customer that no one has a clue how to talk to.,"Tech support for a CRM (Customer Resource Management) software that clients use to organize and communicate with their customers through the system.

One of our regular clients is Kevin. The best way I can describe Kevin is a whiny, bratty, impatient child who never learned how to communicate well, if at all. He has been with us for what will be 2 years in December if I remember correctly, and continues to call in asking questions that your average person who had just signed a contract would have learned within the first month of owning the software. 

A few things to note about Kevin:

* We have a full fucking suite of help articles, videos, tutorials, larger-scale walkthroughs, and one on one thirty minute training classes you can schedule in advance with a member of the team who handles all of the above. Kevin will not lay eyes on a single written word or a single video. He insists on having his hand held through *everything*. Which is fine, but there are some topics that are definitely more easily read with screenshots/watched on a video than talked through. There's also the fact that he's completely SOL on the weekends when we're closed since he actively refuses to read anything.
* Kevin is very, very easily riled up/frustrated, and extremely impatient. He demands an explanation and then cuts you off as you try to explain because he's literally too impatient to hear the answer to his question. He will demand a quick explanation for something when a ""quick"" explanation may not always be possible. At that point, if you try to dumb it down, you cut out vital parts that would actually help him understand the answer, so he's going to be frustrated. If you try to explain more comprehensively, he will cut you off and still be frustrated.
*  He has a very....fragmented knowledge about the system he purchased. An ""approximate knowledge of many things"", as I'd like to call it. He also tends to call in multiple times to have the same things explained to him.

To explain how Kevin asks questions and expects them to be answered, here's a small hypothetical example about how his calls typically go:

&gt;Kevin: I don't understand why the sky is blue. Can you tell me why the sky is blue?  
&gt;  
&gt;You: Well, there's a bunch of gases and particles in the Earth's atmosphere that scatter the sunlight-  
&gt;  
&gt;Kevin: No, no, no, I don't care about all that, what's an atmosphere? Why do I need to care about gases and particles? I just asked you why the sky is blue, can't you explain that to me, just really quick?

I think Kevin may have some form of ADHD, because his thought patterns and way of attempting to comprehend things feels WAY too close to the way I felt before learning to manage the symptoms and get medicated (I am not trying to diagnose him, just saying things are eerily similar). 

The problem is that because he's so easily frustrated and stays frustrated for so long, and also tends to whine a LOT, it's hard to really meet in the middle with him. Talking to him feels as much like talking to a brick wall as some of our other hotheads, but with him, I feel like there's a thread we're missing to communicate with him that he's either not letting us find, or *can't* give us.",22,0,0,"Regular customer that no one has a clue how to talk to.

I'm his second favorite!,"Please do not use this post without permission, etc, etc.

In the early days, the company I worked for wouldn't allow us to discuss discounts unless the guest brought it up first. It was annoying af. Hated seeing guests paying hundreds if not thousands more for a vacation than they had to, simply because they didn't know that discounts existed. We all turned into Bob Parr from The Incredibles, when he ""doesn't"" tell the little old lady how to ""penetrate the bureaucracy.""

Then, one glorious day, the company said, ""hey! Brilliant idea!"" and the reigns came off. Holy crap did we go crazy lol. ""Oh that's a lovely package. Lemme save you some money!"" There were ups and downs to it, but overall we did good by it.

But the best of those were the folks who were trying to book online, then had to call us to fix something. Those calls either meant a) a quick modification and no commission for us or b) a total redo and ALL the commission for us. That's the one we all liked.

So how happy was I when a guy called in and said he was trying to book 3 rooms at our Polynesia-Style resort, but something went wrong and he couldn't figure out his tickets. Booyah. Rooms turned into packages? Full redo. And three of them. \*makes the cash register noise\*.

So I look up his account and find the reservations and I see he's booked them at full price. At the second-most expensive resort we offer. So, knowing I was going to have a phone call worth my time, I relaxed and chatted him up. He had a good-sized party (3 couples and a kid) coming for a family gathering. They had dining in mind, wanted to take in a show or two etc. And, of course, see all the theme parks and water parks and such.

So after looking through his account, I find a discount code. A big one. So I apply it. Now, all he wanted was the basic tickets, but I knew from our conversation he'd be spending far more with all the other stuff they wanted to do. So I took the initiative and booked it with the code, and with a few extras. I threw in our full dining plan, I put in the best tickets for all the parks and water parks, I put in a round of golf he'd mentioned he and his sons were going to play, and I put in tickets for everyone to go see the (now closed) ""Cirque du Soleil"" show. And even with all that, it was still HUNDREDS less across the three packages than what he was originally going to pay for JUST the rooms.

So as I'm chatting, I put all this in, do some quick math, and decide to be a little cheeky.

Me: All right, Sir, I have everything fixed for you here. I've also taken a few liberties that I think you're going to like. Now, who's your favorite person?""

Guest: Um....my wife?

My brain: Okay, well that backfired.

Me: Okay, who's your SECOND-favorite person?

Guest: Um.........you?

Me, now sounding more corny than I'd intended: Correct! Because I have managed to get you a fantastic package.

I listed everything out for him and he gave all the right ""wow"" and ""that's awesome"" responses, then when I was done I said,

Me: ""Oh, and just as an extra treat, the total's about $300 less than your original price on the rooms.""

Guest: ""Holy...really? That's fantastic! Okay you're currently my number two favorite then.""

Me: I understand and I appreciate that rank, Sir.

He was thrilled, talking about the souvenirs he'd be able to buy his granddaughter with the money he'd saved, and how much she was excited about the princesses etc. We got him all set and he left happy.

Couldn't have said it better myself.,"I covered Cable TV billing now and then. Simple job if you understand numbers. Often a huge pain because the customer doesn't. But the most fun part of the job, for me, was the customers calling about their bill being so high, and me explaining the...uh... adult movie charges on PPV. 

99% of the callers were surprised, of course. Some were disappointed their spouse was ordering them, some upset that their kids were, and of course some in utter denial that anyone in their house would order such. Naturally, we could give time and date and title and they'd usually get it, even if some stayed in denial.

But once, just once, I got the perfect response.

The perils of joint accounts,"I work for a bank in their call centre, handling general telephone banking queries and transactions. This call will always stick with me! 

C = Customer in his 50s M = Me

C: My fiancée and I have been going through my banking over the years and I’m sure I had accounts with you, I want to close them as I don’t use them

*We manage to complete security*

M: I can see here that we have two accounts, one individual and another in joint names. 

C: Close them both and send me the cheques

M: Unfortunately the joint account requires 2 signatures to complete any transaction at all, you would have to contact the other account holder and both go to branch either separately or together to request the closure

C: That’s ridiculous! This is my money, I want it now

*Why people think that this will make us change our minds and break the rules is beyond me*

M: Unfortunately sir this is the only way. Are you still in contact with this account holder? 

C: Of course not! That was another wife and another life!

*Yes, they really were his exact words!*

Remembering an old caller.,"Hey folks just sitting at my current job on break reading through TFCC posts while I work this lovely Black Friday and figured I'd add my own story.  Its not about one call but a customer at the investment company I use to work at.  He was the nicest elderly man always called at the end of the day when the market closed and asked about the value on his account, he'd chat for a few minutes and really I feel like it was just his daily way to pass some time.  I think he realized alot of us got off around the time he called so he'd ask what time the person's shift ends and usually if it was a few minutes from then he'd drag his feet til just before so we could end the day on a good note.  While I won't mention his name, his last name was animal related and we actually over time bought a stuffed animal we'd pass around for whoever got his call that day.  

I moved on to another job and about a year later got a text from an old coworker that our favorite customer passed away.  I hadn't been in that job in over a year and I still teared up hearing that.  I got another text a week later that management approved us sending condolence letters to his widow, even former employees so we had to type them up and email them to a contact person that person gathered them all up confirmed they were workplace appropriate, printed them and sent them off.  I thought that would be the end of it, but I got another email a month or so later letting me know that she received all the letters and his wife was absolute floored at how popular her husband was.  She was extremely grateful that we took the time to all write her and I can easily say its the best memory I have of my time at that job.

Hope you all enjoyed the story, I figured we could use some positive stuff since alot of the calls tend to be stressful ones, happy holidays folks.",106,0,0,"Remembering an old caller.

Call Center Blues,"Hey, all. I recently became employed to a company as one of the call center representatives. I do both inbound and outbound. When on the job training began, I noticed a change in me. 

Usually, if I have to get up to go to work, I feel neutral about. Maybe a little miffed I have to wake up and go somewhere, but nothing out of the ordinary. But with this job, every morning I wake up and know I have to clock in, I get horrible anxiety. And I’m usually not so easily stressed out. 

I’ve had a few bad apples on the calls daily, most memorable one being me doing my script and accidentally saying how can I help you to an outbound caller only for him to flip his shit and screaming you called me and I’m about to start class. 

I’m not sure how other call centers operate, but here we have two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch for full timers that earn 40 hours a week. There’s also a system installed into the desktop that monitors our time. I got flagged twice for a call taking over 20 minutes when I was trying to get a hold of the right department and looking up multiple patients for a nurse. I was informed my supervisor got notified of it as well, adding to my stress. 

Time between calls is too short, they want us back to back under 30 seconds. Time between the next calls doesn’t leave enough time for myself to breathe and relax. We get so many calls daily, too, and I’m introverted trying to push myself to do this job. 

Not to mention I feel like I could be responsible for a patient not be able to receive medication that could be the difference between fine and in critical condition, adding more stress. 

I’m just tired of working in this type of field, I don’t think I mind the calls too much, though, I definitely would prefer strictly text chat if that’s even a thing. I don’t know if maybe I’m just new still and it’ll get easier or if this company just isn’t the right fit for me. I’ve already started looking for other jobs, even considering switching even if the pay is lower than the $15/hr I’m making working for this company at home.

"""So you're willing to lose a customer for $3 dollars?""","I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

Many calls. Many angry customers. Gonna drink myself to sleep tonight, but before that I'll share these two tales.

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C1: First customer

So before transferring me the customer, the agent who received the call explained me the situation: Customer wants to make a one day reservation both pick up and drop off at the Sacramento International Airport.

When booking a reservation, you have two options: pay at the counter and pay in advance. If you pay in advance, you get a better rate. The customer was requesting a supervisor because she wanted to pay at the counter, but get the prepay rate, which in my opinion is an idiotic request. Whatever, I'll set the record straight and move on.

C1: They told me that if I pay in advance the rate will be 38 USD, and if I pay at the counter it'll be 41 USD, but I never pay in advance, can you do something about it?

H: I do apologize for the inconvenience ma'am, but it's not possible to give you the prepay rate if you don't pay in advance.

C1: Don't you have a discount or a coupon?

H: No ma'am, I don't have any coupons available and I don't see any specials right now.

C1: What's the base rate you have?

H: 23.99 USD

C1: Why is that? I'm on your website and it shows 22 USD.

H: It is possible that the website has its own special right now. I know it's weird, but even though we're the same company, sometimes the website has better rates than my department...

C1: What about that wholesale food company that sells those bigass slices of pizza (not what she actually said, she just mentioned the name of the wholesale food company), I have a membership, don't you guys offer a discount for that?

Oh God... she's a member of that Company... I've had some **really bad experiences** with them. 

H: Yes, we do have a partnership with them. 

C1: How can I apply the discount? I don't see any options on the website.

This call was taking longer than expected...

H: I'd strongly recommend you go to their website, specifically Wholesale Food Company that sells those bigass slices of pizza Travel dot com.

C1: Why would I need to do that? Why can't I do it on your website?

Guess I won't get rid of her anytime soon, might as well just make her a reservation and move on.

H: That's okay, I'll add the discount myself, can you please provide me your membership number?

She provides me her membership number...

H: Very well, with unlimited miles, taxes and fees included and your discount, it will be 38 USD...

C1: Pay at the counter?

H: Pay at the counter...

I'll admit, that felt wholesome.

So I'm just asking her for basic information like her e-mail, phone number, we even laughed at one point, then...

C1: And this is for a Ford Fusion car, right?

Goddammit...

H: No ma'am, this is for an Intermediate size vehicle like a Corolla or Chevy Cruze.

C1: What? No, I told the agent that I wanted a Full Size car like a Ford Fusion.

I check to see the rate for a Full Size car, and much to my dismay...

H: A Full Size vehicle would be 42 USD

C1: Don't you have like an upgrade coupon?

I check, but I couldn't find an upgrade coupon, not that it would help, if I attached that type of coupon she would get a Standard Size vehicle anyways, not a Full Size.

H: I'm truly sorry ma'am, but this is the best rate I can offer. Should I proceed with the reservation?

C1: Pffft... No. So you're willing to lose a customer just for 3 dollars?

H: I can't go any lower, sorry.

C1: Guess I'll have to go with another company, I won't rent from you guys anymore.

H: So be it, sorry to hear that.

C1: Wait... did you just say ""so be it""?

H: ... Yeah?

C1: Tcht, such great customer service you have.

Then I can hear her in the background ""can you believe this? He just told me ""so be it"".

*Click*

Nearly 10 minutes trying to assist this bitch just for her to tell me ""are you willing to lose a customer just for 3 dollars?"". Don't like the rate? Feel free to shop around. Such a novelty concept, which leads to the following story where I had to deal with this asshole:

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C2: Second customer

C2: Hey HenriquesDumbCousin, so I just made a Reservation at the Hard Rock Hotel and I liked the rate (it was like 200 USD), but then I realized that I made the Reservation wrong. I selected both pick up and drop off at the Hard Rock Hotel, but I need to return the vehicle at the Orlando International Airport.

H: Uh-huh...

C2: But when I tried to fix my mistake, the rate of the Reservation increased 200 USD more! What's up with that?

H: I do apologize for that, sir. Most of the time round trips are cheaper when compared to one way rentals.

C2: But Hard Rock and Orlando International are very close!

H: If that's the case, in order to avoid any issues, I'd strongly recommend you return the vehicle at Hard Rock and take a Taxi or an Uber to Orlando International.

C2: No, no, you don't understand, I don't want to return the vehicle at Hard Rock, I want to drop it at Orlando International.

H: I'm truly sorry sir, but there's nothing I can do.

C2: But it's not even a one way rental, I mean, I'm dropping the vehicle in the same city.

H: But you're dropping it in a different location.

Customer continues to request that we do something for him.

C2: There has to be something you can do for me HenriquesDumbCousin. 

H: My hands are tied, sir. That's the best rate we have for you, if you don't like that rate I'd strongly recommend you shop around.

*Awkward silence*

C2: What... what did you just say to me?

H: Ummm... you're welcome to shop around? I mean, you may find a better rate with another company.

C2: Are you even allowed to say that? 

H: Pardon me?

C2: HenriquesDumbCousin, I need to speak with a higher up, who do you answer to?

For fuck's sake.

H: I can't share that person's information and he doesn't take any calls. Sir, I'm sorry, but this is the best rate we can offer, if you don't like it we won't force you to pay for it, this is America after all.

C2: ""This is America""? So now you're mocking me.

What the fuck is wrong with this guy?

C2: You think I wouldn't know that? Of course I can go with another company, you think I haven't thought about that? Let me tell you, HenriquesDumbCousin, I own several businesses...

Accidentally Exposed a Family Fraud,"I work for a small local ISP.  One of the things I sometime do is help out the billing person &amp; call people whose credit cards have failed to process.

We have a lot of elderly customers &amp; not so elderly customers with adult children currently in the home.  In order for us to be able to speak with these people &amp; troubleshoot, service issues or discuss billing issues,  they have to be named as ""authorized contacts"".  It is perfectly normal for our customer Charles Smith to have Mary, Jane &amp; Kevin Smith listed as contacts &amp; for Jane Smith to be the name on the credit card.

Normal process in the case of a credit card fail is call the customer first, regardless of whose name is on the card. 95% of the time the customer gives us another card &amp; we move on.  The other 5% they either direct us to the card holder or say they will ask the card holder to call us.  If the card holder doesn't contact us, we reach out to them in a day or so.

Charles Smith has card in the name of Jane Smith on his account.  It failed &amp; the billing person called him  &amp; Charles said he'd ask Jane to call.  Jane didn't call so a few days later I called Jane.

Jane had no idea why I was calling about a credit card. She isn't paying the bill, her dad is.  I explained the card on file was in her name &amp; gave her the last 4 digits.  She said she has no card that ends in them &amp; I must be mistaken about the card.  I said the card had been on the account for 4 months, under her name &amp; that my coworker had spoken to her dad &amp; her dad had said he would get Jane to call us.  Again, I must be mistaken, she doesn't pay this bill &amp; I need to sort this with her dad.

I call Charles, get voice mail, leave &amp; message &amp; life goes on at internetsRus until next month when Charles' card fails again.  Billing person calls him, gets told again that Jane will call him.  Jane fails to call &amp; I call her.  This time Jane conferences in Charles in the call.  Charles tries to obfuscate the issue &amp; blames us for misunderstanding him. I point out I have the call records &amp; we can all listen to them if they give me a few minutes.  Charles says there is no need, he'll go find his wallet &amp; call me back.  A guy calls, says he's Kevin Smith &amp; gives us a new card.

4 months later it begins to fail &amp; we call Kevin.  Surprise! Kevin has no idea what we are talking about &amp; it's a repeat of Jane's call.  The second time it fails though Kevin says he'll have to call us back.  A few days later he asks for copies of the invoices his card was charged to. Then Jane calls &amp; requests the same.  Eventually we got a visit from the cops with paperwork asking for our billing &amp; call records with Charles Smith.  

No details on why at that time, but some of the cops are gossipy sorts &amp; we share a building complex with a police station &amp; the cops are often in our building meeting with various lawyers &amp; such.  So it was only a matter time before one of my smoker coworkers  met up with a smoker cop &amp; found out that Charles Smith was arrested for identity theft &amp; his kids were the victims.  Small town local gossip puts it at over $250,000 dollars worth of charges on cards opened in the kids' names.  Not sure if that is true &amp; his only mention in the news was under the ""Arrests this Week"" column, for fraud.  We're all interested to see how it plays out.

Billing person calls him, gets told again that Jane will call him.  Jane fails to call &amp; I call her.  This time Jane conferences in Charles in the call.  Charles tries to obfuscate the issue &amp; blames us for misunderstanding him. I point out I have the call records &amp; we can all listen to them if they give me a few minutes.  Charles says there is no need, he'll go find his wallet &amp; call me back.  A guy calls, says he's Kevin Smith &amp; gives us a new card.

4 months later it begins to fail &amp; we call Kevin.  Surprise! Kevin has no idea what we are talking about &amp; it's a repeat of Jane's call.  The second time it fails though Kevin says he'll have to call us back.  A few days later he asks for copies of the invoices his card was charged to. Then Jane calls &amp; requests the same.  Eventually we got a visit from the cops with paperwork asking for our billing &amp; call records with Charles Smith.  

No details on why at that time, but some of the cops are gossipy sorts &amp; we share a building complex with a police station &amp; the cops are often in our building meeting with various lawyers &amp; such.  So it was only a matter time before one of my smoker coworkers  met up with a smoker cop &amp; found out that Charles Smith was arrested for identity theft &amp; his kids were the victims.  Small town local gossip puts it at over $250,000 dollars worth of charges on cards opened in the kids' names.  Not sure if that is true &amp; his only mention in the news was under the ""Arrests this Week"" column, for fraud.  We're all interested to see how it plays out.

TL:DR  Parent steals kids' identity, commits fraud, eventually is found out &amp; arrested when he doesn't pay his internet bill."
"""I can hear you...""","So this was back in April after I first started working from home.

We were given new headsets with a mute button on for silent holds which I used pretty frequently to either bitch about my customers or just cough/sneeze. You know, the usual stuff. I'm also a pretty loud talker on the phone, I have relatively poor hearing so I've always been a pretty loud person but I'd also had a couple comments from people saying they couldn't hear me on the phone  since WFH.

So I'm helping this guy with his order, and I tell him I'm gonna go quiet for a couple mins whilst I put it through for him.

At this point, I start singing (very loudly and very badly) ""oooh whatya saay"" (yeah, THAT song), and my partner shouts me from upstairs asking:

 ""Why are you so loud when you're on the phone?!""

Me: ""Because if I'm not loud nobody can fucking hear me!""

Customer: ""Oh I can hear you""

Me: *heart drops* ""Oh sorry about that... Just working from home problems y'know *nervous laughter hoping the call isn't listened to*?""

Customer: ""Haha yeah...""

At this point I *swiftly* wrapped up the call and curled up on my sofa to die for a while before moving onto my next one. I don't know if I've ever been more fearful for my job than in that moment but thankfully I never heard about it again.

Few things I wondered at the end of this call:
1 - how many fucking people have I talked shit about and have blatantly heard me
2 - what the hell was this guy thinking when he heard me spontaneously come out with singing in the middle of a phone call
3 - WHY DIDNT HE SAY ANYTHING BEFORE I SWORE 

I did mention the fact that the mute button didn't seem to be working for me to my manager and apparently it was/is a known problem.",93,0,0,"""I can hear you..."" So this was back in April after I first started working from home.

Mom ruins sons credit and blames us,"I work in a call center for a bank. This bank finances auto loans. So most of our calls pertain to car payments or our website.

Had a lady call in earlier today. We can call her Karen for obvious reasons. As she calls in, an account pops up with a male name attached. I learn quickly that its her sons car and loan. He had previously called in at the beginning of this month to permanently authorize her on the account. Meaning I have permission to speak with her.

She calls in, I do my standard greeting. I'm cut off about half way through with ""Yeah, yeah, I know. The call is recorded. I've heard it before. I've been on hold forever and we need to fix something right now."" Great. This should be fun.

I glance over the account quickly while she's verifying the information. I notice the account is only a few months old and there's already a late payment marked on the account. Meaning a payment went over a month past due so we reported it as late to the credit bureaus. Sure enough, after verifying the account she hits me with the old ""We made a payment on time and your company screwed up and now its affecting my sons credit and he's trying to buy a house and he can't now blah blah blah"". Its very common for customers to blame us when a payment is late. They think we don't keep records of our calls. I don't know.

So this lady claims that her son called in a week before his first payment was even due. He made a payment using his checking account. She claims we must have taken down the numbers wrong because the payment never came out. A month goes by and thats when they realize the account was behind. They get it caught up but its too late. The damage is done. She wants that credit mark removed since we messed up.

Now, even if that entire story were true and we took down the numbers wrong, the chances of us doing anything about the credit mark are slim. For multiple reasons. But I decide to humor her a bit. I tell her that I'll pull the call from that day, review it, and if she's correct and we took the information down wrong, I can pass along the account. I made sure to mention that even if that was the case, I can't promise anything.

So I pull the call and listen. And boy oh boy.

To start, it wasn't even the son (the account holder) calling in. It was VERY CLEARLY the same woman I had just spoken with. However this was BEFORE her son had authorized us to speak with her. So she lied about who she was and claimed to be the son. The son has a gender neutral name and the mom was able to verify his birthday/social, so that representative believed her. But regardless, she lied about her identity. That's considered fraud. Strike one.

Secondly, she did not call in early. The account was actually over a week behind. On its first payment. And it was made clear to her within the first 30 seconds of the call. The representative specifically told her it was a week behind and asked why that was the case. The mother claimed something about COVID. So she lied again about when she tried to make the payment. Strike two.

Third, during the processing of the payment, the representative specifically read back both the routing number and the account number for the checking account. The mom confirmed the information was correct. So her main claim about us taking the information down incorrectly was also a lie. She GAVE us the wrong information. Strike three.

On top of all of that, we called her sons phone every day and left messages. We sent bills stating the account was past due. The son had the account registered online and never bothered to log in to check that his first payment went through. And they clearly never checked the bank account to make sure the payment had come out. This is literally 100% on them. 

I had the pleasure of calling the woman back to inform her the waiver request was denied. That call may be good for a separate post. But she did not take it kindly and demanded to speak with the manager that listened to the call. Imagine her shock when I let her know that I had listened to the call myself.

Tl;dr don't let anyone else manage bills that are technically your responsibility. This guys credit is now hit pretty hard because he left it in the hands of his mother. Try not to feel bad for him. He's in his mid to late 20s and should be handling his own finances. Especially if he IS trying to buy a house. Which is hard to believe considering Karen lied about everything else.

EDIT: For those asking, the son definitely knew about the loan. Not only would he have had to have been at the dealership to sign the contract, but there was notes in the account that we spoke to both the son and the mom during the call where the son authorized her on the account.",738,0,0,"Mom ruins sons credit and blames us I work in a call center for a bank.

Creepy....stop talking please.,"Just happened now.

He then jokes about his last name which is close to a swear. Ok fine. 

Then he starts making immature jokes about breasts, farts, poop and sex. Um....ok.

THEN he let me know he was in his 60s and he has a 21 year old girlfriend from the Philippines that he brought to the states and he loves now domesticated she is. That's... disturbing.

Today I hung up on a rude customer,"Hey there, I’m still fairly new here and still new to working in a call center. I made my first post here only yesterday. 

I just got off the phone with a customer who was extremely upset her exercise equipment delivery was pushed back to January. The reason she was given by the girl who took the call before me was because the warehouse reported inclement weather.

I did everything I could to try to deescalate her. I gave her a partial refund. I offered to get her in touch with a supervisor. I told her, odds are, she will get bumped back up soon as most people are. I tried to set her mind at ease about how she “would be put in the back of the delivery schedule” by telling her that isn’t true. I tried to keep calm but she continued to berate and belittle me. 

So I hung up. And I blamed it on internet connectivity and browser issues. The “training” we were put through was hardly training at all and I’m not an actual employee with this exercise company. I don’t know the best ways to make a person relax over the phone when they’re going off the rails. But I couldn’t take being berated anymore by this woman. I was shaking and hearing her talk shit about me to her husband in the background was too overwhelming. When I went to reassure her she would talk over me and insult me.

I usually recognize their anger isn’t directed to me personally but to me this one particular call felt personal. I’m a bit nervous about the possible consequences I might face if someone finds out I purposely hung up on her but I tried to hold it together as best as I would while I had her on the phone and did everything I knew to do to try to ease her. 

I hope this gets easier. I don’t dislike this job but feeling the brunt of people’s misdirected anger is really so exhausting. I’m not paid much to begin with but I’m definitely not paid enough to be insulted even when I exhaust everything I know to do in these particular situations. 

Has this happened to you? Any advice? Is there ever a situation where this is okay within your own companies? Was it not okay? I feel a bit gross as a person currently but I’m not kidding when I say I did everything I was trained to do when a person is like this but I couldn’t continue letting her insult me..",22,0,0,"Today I hung up on a rude customer Hey there, I’m still fairly new here and still new to working in a call center.

Entering wife's policy because you work in corporate and making a complaint about the price - get fired.,"When I worked for a car insurance company I received a complaint from one of my staff about a renewal price. They said the caller was the policy holders husband who was named as a driver. He'd told them on the phone he knew the commission levels on the policy and knew we could offer a better discount than the one we applied as a retention tool. He was not nice at all to my staff member. 

The language he used showed he had clear working knowledge of our systems and processes. A quick search for his name on the company message service shows he's in the corporate office.

I emailled my manager and said this wasn't appropriate, there were clear footprints in the policy showing when he'd accessed it over the past month or so and had played with the commissions himself to try and get favourable prices.

"""You are being sued! You ripped us off! To settle this lawsuit send $500 a month in a check made out to cash to P.O. Box XXXX Los Angeles CA""","A little over a decade ago, I was doing Customer Service for a cell phone company.  Sometimes that meant taking calls, sometimes that meant answering incoming customer complaint letters. . .and calling the customer back to discuss their complaint.

This was probably the weirdest letter I got though, and that is saying something:

We got what appeared to be a faded and distorted photocopy of some legal papers dated September, 1985 (this was in 2009) about a law firm in L.A. filing some motion against the city for something involving a building permit for a greenhouse.

The plaintiffs address was crossed out and had ""Address not available"" written there. 

The letterhead for the Law Firm had the words ""Lawyer for suing Cell Phone company!"" written beside it and underlined and an arrow going from those words to the letterhead. 

The entire body of the letter was crossed out with what looked like a sharpie, and handwritten in the margins beside it in pen was:

I totally understand the fear for the safety of her child, as mice can carry fleas and diseases.

I couldn't set up services with her, just her landlord though. I tried to ask some more questions to understand the condition of the house we were working with more (ie are there holes the mice got in and stuff).

She told me about how the ceiling was leaking (the landlord did nothing about it), and now the basement backed up this March from the septic tank and the landlord never cleaned it. I was aghast. The amount of possible mold on top of SEWAGE, my dear readers, LEFTOVER SEWAGE, that the landlord refused to treat was inhumane and unbelievable. She and her husband have a newborn baby for goodness sake.

I had to do something. I looked up the local code enforcement office for the city and gave her the office number as the house qualified for emergency servicing from what I skimmed on their website. I also told her what the local government website was and how I was able to Google it so that she can find it easier. She said she will call tomorrow morning and I am so excited for her!

Did I mention the landlord's increased rent during the lockdown and had the nerve to tell her that if she wants to rent month to month, it is $300 extra a month for the conditions the landlord has let happen to the house? Not to mention it is in a bad neighborhood where gunshots are heard all the time. Oh no. Sigh. I felt so bad for her and hopefully, the landlord will either let her out of the lease without a $1,000 FEE! That's right folks, $1,000!! And they can't even be bothered to fix a leaky roof, much less SEWAGE ROTTING IN THE BASEMENT. Oh, and mice. Did I mention the mold from the leaky roof? It's definitely there on top of in the basement.

I noted this in my personal notes as if the landlord does come to us for pest control, I want the technicians to be aware of possible health hazards, plus I was on the phone for WAAAAY longer than I needed to be. But this young lady my age needed help, and I couldn't just stand there and do nothing. She didn't know where to start to check legal rights for renters. I only knew about code enforcers thanks to the show Hoarders.

I hope I did the right thing.

So client, even though we may never speak again, I hope you are able to move with your family somewhere safer, and I want you to know that you helped me find joy by being able to help you in what has been one of the lowest points in my life.

My possible client was telling me over the phone how she was terrified of mice and they are invading the home she is renting.

Karen is mad she has to put in the effort for us to be able to help her.," 

Long story short, I help take calls for pest control companies.

A Karen calls in, upset that in the email we sent her, we told her that to put down the products and baits needed for ants and other pests, she needs to empty out her cupboards and drawers in the kitchen and replace the paper on the bottom.

She whined how it was too much work and how other companies didn't do that and only came twice a year, which dear readers, most do not do anymore (source: I work 3rd party for over 50 pest control companies, some of which are nation-wide, some local. Basically no one does this because it takes super harsh and dangerous chemicals) I tried to source how we have been open since before WWII, but alas, this is too much work for Karen, so she is canceling. LOL.

Like fr, what are you expecting, us to guarantee something when we can't do our job right? No! Like, yeah, it's an inconvenience, but who is the expert here Karen, us, or you?

Lol, good luck to the next pest control company. If her cupboards were that bad, that means that she really needed us. Roll of eyes people. Rolle of eyes.",24,0,0,"Karen is mad she has to put in the effort for us to be able to help her.

I hung up on a customer without warning them,"I have been working for a bank for the past 3 years. I consider myself to be a pretty relaxed and laid back person so I don’t feel like I get in battles frequently with the customers. 

Countless times I’ve called customer service and feel like the customer service I got was awful so I don’t want others to go through that. I also really enjoy my job and feeling like I’ve helped someone with their issue. 

That said, there are still some calls where I’d love to just hang up but I’ve never done it (with the exception of once. 30 seconds into a call a guy said he was gonna cum on my face; wtf?) 

Where I work we have been told if we are put in an abusive situation we must warn the customer prior to terminating and give them a chance to cool down. 

I have had to give the “hey, I’d like to keep this call professional” warning a few times before and it works wonders. 

I didn’t today. No warning. Just hung up. 

For some background, our bank is strict about certain fee waivers. There are fees that we are not able to waive at all, even if we tried. There is literally no button for it- if we think it’s a bank error we can send a notice to a much higher up supervisor. But it has to be a serious situation or we will get in trouble when they ask *my* supervisor why we are requesting them for fee waivers. 

I had a guy call in and immediately hit me with a bunch of questions, some of them, I wasn’t even able to answer because it was outside of my realm of expertise or I legally could not because he was asking sensitive info about his banking relationship and I did not have access to that. It was outside the realm of what a customer service rep normally would have access to. It would be like asking your pizza delivery driver for legal and tax advice and then asking him to solve a complicated calculus equation and recite a Shakespearean soliloquy from heart. 

I tried to calm him down and explain what I knew. “Sir, you’re behind on your payment because there was a balance due on [due date]). I do not have access to that other information as I am a customer service rep but in typical situations here is how it goes...”

He let the difficult questions go at that point. What was important was that it wasn’t his fault that he was late on his payment so I need to waive fees.

“Sir, we sent a statement by mail stating this payment was due by [due date].” I said. 

Well, we promised him by phone he didn’t have to pay. 

“I’m very sorry we misinformed you, sir, but we sent this in writing that a payment was due.” 

Well, he tried to pay by phone but we were closed. So I need to waive fees. 

“I apologize sir, but we do not waive fees. (Don’t agree with it, but it’s not my company) Sir, I do not know why you were misinformed and can’t comprehend why that happened and I apologize. I show that we sent a statement by mail a month ago stating a payment was due.” 

The man starts acting belligerent and I hear him and a woman yelling at each other and talking trash about me like I was not there and couldn’t hear it. He said I told him to “pay now or I’ll report him to the credit bureaus” (I said no such thing, never even implied this), that I “can’t see anything and can’t help” and essentially just seemed to craft a narrative about how I was refusing to help when it was completely opposite. He just didn’t want to accept the help and wanted to be a victim. 

He then starts handing the phone to random people. Every time a new person comes on the line (including being put on speaker phone) we have to warn that the call is being recorded (for legal reasons in some states) and ask who I’m speaking with. If I am not speaking with someone not on the file, I can’t release any info. 

Woman (call her Anne) is put on the phone and states her full name after I state the recording blurb. 

“I’m Anne Doe, look we really just need these fees waived. Can you please just waive them because I want to finish cleaning, please just waive them.” 

This call is already going south and I feel uncomfortable as I’ve already said no. On top of that, the customer constantly switching the phone between people is confusing, so I figure maybe I will see if there are any type of fees I can credit back that will please them. 

I ask Anne to wait a second and let me look. 

There are no fees I can credit back. 

“Anne, I’m sorry about the wait. I can’t waive any fees. It does not allow me to, our bank does not waive these fees.” 

“So you can’t waive the fees?”

“No, I’m sorry.” 

Anne puts me on speaker phone and goes ballistic. “TELL ME WHY! TELL ME WHY!” She begins shrieking. 

“Okay, wait just a moment.” At this point, I raise my voice and become firm. “I need to know everyone I’m speaking with.” I read the disclosure about recording. 

“No!” Anne shrieks. “You can’t answer my question! Answer it! What is wrong with you?! Is something the matter with you? Just do your job!” 

She is going absolutely nuts and my blood starts boiling. I knew raising my voice was a mistake, but her behavior completely caught me off guard. Perhaps there was a better way to handle it but I was stunned with how quickly her behavior had changed. 

“Ma’am, I need to know who I’m speaking with before I proceed. Who all is in the room?”

“You know who it is and you’re avoiding my question!” Anne was completely belligerent and shouting insults into the phone. And then. She *mocked* me. “Hello? Hello? You gonna pretend to hang up? This call may be monitored or recorded. Hello? Hello?” She sounded like an 8 year old. 

I went silent, kind of froze. I had no idea what to say or do. I didn’t even want to give this person the chance to play nice. I let her scream at and mock me for about 30 seconds and then just... *click*. I was thinking.. what do I say to move this conversation forward? Do I jump in and give another opportunity to this person to attempt to bully and gaslight me? I just didn’t want to put up with it, consequences be damned. 

Admittedly, I don’t remember if she said anything extremely awful. I just remember the belligerent, sometimes incoherent screaming and lastly I think that the “what’s wrong with you” thing really bothered me because I have been a victim of gaslighting like this before. Made to feel like I was completely crazy for something that was unproblematic and a reasonable boundary for me to set. It definitely triggered something in me and I didn’t want to continue to take this. 

Here’s the kicker. You know how much the fees were? 

It was for a single dollar. This woman and man had gone ballistic over having to pay a dollar after not paying the balance owed for *multiple* months. 🤔 

Unless I’m given a reason otherwise, I believe what the customer says. One of our reps screwed up. They didn’t get their statement. They were freaked out about the bill because they’ve never used a bank product and was scared to call. Whatever. 

But in this instance this guy had already called us multiple times to complain and was behind multiple months. On top of that, he actually was granted a fee waiver 6 months prior when the same thing happened. He seemed to use credit, carry a balance and not pay. Decide to pay after multiple missed payments, and then raise hell with our reps to get out of the consequences that come after not paying your bill on time. 


So yeah. This call happened a while back so I’m comfortable with sharing this story. I wrote this the day it happened and just waited a while.

I’m sorry you can’t get what you want in a pandemic,"I’ve been working for a call center for almost a month now. Specifically, I take calls for a very popular upscale exercise equipment brand. 

Due to Covid-19, ports are slowed down exponentially so there’s a shortage of inventory in the continental US. We went from having approximately 100 pieces of exercise equipment per cargo ship to only 50. Because of quarantines, demand has also skyrocketed so there’s very few pieces of equipment to go around. Warehouses are also having to close because of staffing issues related to Covid so that’s pushing delivery dates even further back.

All day I get berated by customers for not being able to give them their overpriced exercise equipment right at this second. Most customers are on the wealthier end and expect instant gratification immediately despite the fact we are in a pandemic and I cannot help beyond being a communication bridge between our customers and delivery partners. Some of our wait times are 3 months or longer because of all these factors. I don’t like it but it’s completely out of my control and I wish people would realize this instead of feel the need to be so mean.

She continued in her IM without me replying and it said “order shipped and will arrive tomorrow, customer wants to know why they weren’t told.”
In my department, because it’s changes, if your RX changes and we can’t get a hold of you, we ship it to keep from there being a gap in service, as long as the patient has refilled within the last 30 days (this is tube feeding, mind you). 

I just ignored it, and I forgot my IM shows me in a meeting for the reminder I set myself...Woops. “I’ll email you and you can call her after your meeting.”

I *actually* *enjoy* speaking with the worst Karens,"Hey there. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I am one of the few who genuinely enjoys working in a BPO and speaking with the worst callers there.

All that making an ass out of herself out of sheer stupidity. We have an SOP on releasing calls for extreme behavior, but I generally am one of the few who does not disconnect on these instances as it is music to my ears.


There was also this woman who was violently disputing her CC transactions about prolly 29.99/month for the past year or so, the line item is not detailed thats why she had to call, and upon investigating, it turns out it was a Grindr subscription made by her husband who she totally thought was straight (I heard their confrontation and some glass/furniture breaking, too bad there is an SOP for unreponsive customers, I did not get to hear how their fight played out. I like revelations and betrayals.

Sir i need to authenticate you first.,"So this happened over a week ago. So this person wanted to be transferred to make a dispute. He says ""I need my money"" over and over again. And pulls the ""you don't know what us unemployed go through"" card. Clearly I do but not the point.

He kept complaining. I wanted to tell him ""shut the hell up"" call are being recorded so not really an option.

He passed half the authentication but got his address wrong.

Me: ""Sir, since you can't complete the authentication we need to go to another department.""

Bilingual rep - maybe?,"Abou 20 years ago, I spent 2 years working for an inbound, satellite TV company. I was technically bilingual via my schooling, but even though the French reps made more per hour, I didn't feel confident enough in my skills.

We were supposed to apologise and dump them back into the proper queue - but their wait times were atrocious.

Customer threatens to complain to FOS for not being entitled to a refund after receiving a payout for his claim,"This happened a few years ago so I don’t remember the exact conversation. I also don’t expect everyone to be experts on insurance but you would think that certain things are obvious, especially when you have documents that clearly state it.

For those that never had to deal with uk insurance or know much about it, here’s the important bit. FOS is the financial ombudsman service. If a customer is not satisfied with a complaint they can escalate this to FOS who will investigate further and basically decide who’s in the right, there’s a bit more to it but as an insurer we would have to comply with their decision.

Also the way our policies work is they are 12 month contracts. Like most insurance the agreement is basically you pay £x amount and for (12 months) if you need to make a claim you are covered. So although you can call to cancel mid term, if you’ve claimed and we pay out you’re not entitled to any refund as the contract fairly states.

This customer had taken out pet insurance with us and had been renewing for a few years until his pet sadly passed away. So after speaking to our claims team and being told he would receive a payout they transferred him to me to cancel.

I confirmed that the policy had now been cancelled and sympathised with his pet passing away. He then asked when he would be receiving his refund. I tried to explain that as he had made a claim and would be receiving a payout he isn’t entitled to a pro rata refund for cancelling. He then got annoyed with this answer saying that’s illegal and we have to refund him as he’s cancelling. I try and explain as clearly as I can the contract and even said his logic wouldn’t make any sense but he just wouldn’t understand and continued to get more annoyed.

After trying my best to explain he said he will be taking this further to FOS as we’re breaking the law and trying to scam him. At this point I just gave up and said ok if that’s how you feel would you like me to make an official complaint as FOS will not just accept any complaint with a customer unless they have exhausted all of the insurers complaint procedure first. He declined saying he has already done this and will be going straight to them. I just thought fair enough I’ve done everything I can and the call ended.

I did check his file after to see the complaint and saw that it was for something completely unrelated. I can’t remember what it was but remember thinking it was stupid so explains why this person was so difficult to deal with. Anyway knew he would have to come back to us because of this as FOS will just turn him down when they discover the complaint isn’t related so I kept my eye on the policy for a while to see if anything came of it.

"""That's why I hate speaking with people from other countries!""","tl;dr customer fucked around, found out

I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C: Customer

H: Thank you for calling Rental Car Company, my name is HenriquesDumbCousin, may I have your name?

C: Where are you located HenriquesDumbCousin?

To me, this is always a red flag. Each and every customer that has asked me this ends up being a complete twat who has no problem blaming people from other countries instead of admitting that they fucked up.

H: California

C: California?

H: Yes sir, California. How can I assist you today?

So the customer tells me that after 30 days with the vehicle he wishes to extend his reservation for an additional 29 days.

**TECHNICAL PART STARTS HERE**

In the General Reservations department, reservations can only last 59 days. If the customer wants to rent the vehicle for a longer amount of time, they need to speak with the Mini-Lease department. 

Now, this part is tricky, if the customer makes a reservation for less than 30 days, they're only allowed to extend the reservation 3 times and it cannot exceed the 30 day limit.

If the reservation was made for more than 30 days, it cannot be extended at any point.

For example, if the customer made the Reservation for 1 days, they can only extend the Reservation 3 times and it can only be for 29 more days.

If the customer made the Reservation for 15 days, they can only extend the Reservation 3 times and it can only be for 15 more days.

If the customer made the Reservation for 40 days , they can't extend it anymore.

**TECHNICAL PART ENDS HERE**

H: I do apologize, but it won't be possible, we cannot exceed the 30 day limit...

C: But the agent told me that customers can make reservations for a period of 59 days!

H: Yes, but such decisions need to be made before picking up the vehicle. Once you get a contract, it's not possible to extend it more than 30 days.

The original reservation was merely a week. The customer called and extended the reservation until he reached the 30 day limit.

C: So you're telling me that I should have made the reservation for 59 days?

H: That is correct, sir.

C: See? This is a problem HenriquesDumbCousin, the person I spoke with yesterday, I think she told me she was from India, she told me that I could extend the rental for 29 more days! I already made plans, this is a big inconvenience!

I honestly doubt the customer is being honest here. I suspect he  just called and asked how long could a rental be without sharing more information. The agent, not knowing that it was an active reservation, told him that they can be up to 59 days and that's it. Otherwise, why did the customer didn't extend the reservation at that precise moment? 

Regardless, it was his own fuck up, he waited until the reservation was nearly over to extend it for another month, not to mention if it was such an inconvenience to close the current contract and get a new one at the location, that means he acted before consulting us in the first place.

H: I would strongly recommend to return the vehicle to the location, close your current contract and get a new one, sir.

C: ... You're in another country! See! That's why I hate speaking with people from other countries, you guys don't know what you're doing, you people only cause trouble!""

H: That's okay, sir. That makes two of us, good bye!

*Click*

H: Idiot...

After ending that call, I was under the impression that the customer would do the right thing and return the vehicle, maybe 1 or 2 days late and get a new contract. Little did I knew that he would take matters into his own hands. 

Idiotically, the customer decided to keep the vehicle despite the fact that he was contacted multiple times by the location. Not only has the vehicle been reported stolen (it appears they will dispatch a repo team soon), he has been placed in the Do Not Rent list and no doubt in my mind he'll have to pay a very handsome amount for his fuck up.

I found out he called today. Based on the notes from the Supervisor, he wasted no time blaming both me and the agent for providing him with false information (despite the fact that I told him it was not possible to extend the Reservation). He then told the Supervisor that he knew the manager at the location he rented from.

The Supervisor then called the rental location, and they were familiar with the situation. They told the Supervisor that they had tried to contact the customer multiple times, but he never picked up the phone.

The Supervisor told the customer that he needed to return the vehicle as soon as possible to any rental location. The customer told him that it wasn't possible. When the Supervisor asked why, the customer admitted that he wasn't even in the same state, he flew to New York, and during his stay he tested positive for Covid-19, so he had to quarantine himself two additional weeks. When the Supervisor suggested to contact Roadside Assistance to have the vehicle picked up, he said that the vehicle was locked inside his garage, so it wouldn't be possible for them to retrieve the vehicle.

The customer ended the call threatening the Supervisor that he would contact a higher department (possibly referring to corporate) and hung up.

C: See? This is a problem HenriquesDumbCousin, the person I spoke with yesterday, I think she told me she was from India, she told me that I could extend the rental for 29 more days! I already made plans, this is a big inconvenience!

I honestly doubt the customer is being honest here. I suspect he  just called and asked how long could a rental be without sharing more information. The agent, not knowing that it was an active reservation, told him that they can be up to 59 days and that's it. Otherwise, why did the customer didn't extend the reservation at that precise moment? 

Regardless, it was his own fuck up, he waited until the reservation was nearly over to extend it for another month, not to mention if it was such an inconvenience to close the current contract and get a new one at the location, that means he acted before consulting us in the first place.

H: I would strongly recommend to return the vehicle to the location, close your current contract and get a new one, sir.

C: ... You're in another country! See! That's why I hate speaking with people from other countries, you guys don't know what you're doing, you people only cause trouble!""

H: That's okay, sir. That makes two of us, good bye!

H: Idiot...

After ending that call, I was under the impression that the customer would do the right thing and return the vehicle, maybe 1 or 2 days late and get a new contract. Little did I knew that he would take matters into his own hands. 

Idiotically, the customer decided to keep the vehicle despite the fact that he was contacted multiple times by the location. Not only has the vehicle been reported stolen (it appears they will dispatch a repo team soon), he has been placed in the Do Not Rent list and no doubt in my mind he'll have to pay a very handsome amount for his fuck up.

I found out he called today. Based on the notes from the Supervisor, he wasted no time blaming both me and the agent for providing him with false information (despite the fact that I told him it was not possible to extend the Reservation). He then told the Supervisor that he knew the manager at the location he rented from.

The Supervisor then called the rental location, and they were familiar with the situation. They told the Supervisor that they had tried to contact the customer multiple times, but he never picked up the phone.

The Supervisor told the customer that he needed to return the vehicle as soon as possible to any rental location. The customer told him that it wasn't possible. When the Supervisor asked why, the customer admitted that he wasn't even in the same state, he flew to New York, and during his stay he tested positive for Covid-19, so he had to quarantine himself two additional weeks. When the Supervisor suggested to contact Roadside Assistance to have the vehicle picked up, he said that the vehicle was locked inside his garage, so it wouldn't be possible for them to retrieve the vehicle.

The customer ended the call threatening the Supervisor that he would contact a higher department (possibly referring to corporate) and hung up.

This is, without a doubt, the biggest fuck up I've seen in a long time."
“That’s not legal!” Yes it is,"Short and simple today my dudes. I work auto/motorcycle insurance.

Older gentleman calls inquiring on a refund he got. I explained to him that since he was paid out a bit further than the date he cancelled his policy it resulted in a refund! Yay!

Me: Sir, I apologize but since the policy was cancelled early there was a cancellation penalty applied so the refund amount is correct.

Translation serves Aaaggghhh,"Ok I'm going to have a gripe,  a whine a cry baby tantrum about getting calls through translation services.     Now I don't know if this is the same in all call centers but whenever I get the prompt that the call is from a translation service I feel like hanging up and here's why.

Now this may just be the people my company uses but what they do I find extremely frustrating.

Firstly when answering a call we all give the company introduction and most customers by the large majority, even the brain dead Karens let us finish it.    No they talk through it.  

Secondly in a lot of cases the customer speaks very little English and the interpreter will speak half to them and half to me.   All the while I can hear both people and the customer will say somethings in English that seems to be to me and sometimes the interpreter will say things to the customer but then again it could be me.   Then it will be half English,  half the customers language.  Also to add a lot of the interpreters come from the country they are interpreting for;  no surprise there and thus often have very strong accents making it even harder to know if the interpreter is talking or the customer.   So is the customer speaking to me directly,  to the interpreter.     I have only had a few who do something remarkable which makes the call a lot easier.      Now I don't know if those people have a better system but they put me on hold so I don't hear the conversation b/w them and the customer and they put the customer on hold when relaying it back to me and getting the answer.

I'm not a Karen,"This customer called me. A product that she was returning had not been scanned in by the delivery service we typically use. She had called them and then had called us, going back and forth. She just wanted to return the item and get her refund, determined to not look like a lying liar.

The customer states that it was the principle of the matter and that this delivery company often jerks her around. She called back a short while and I get her call again, which I am pleased about because honestly, this woman is hilarious. 

She tells me, ""I told them what time I came in to drop off my package, and everything that was on the label, because I always document everything. They still insisted I hadn't brought anything in and refused to look at the cameras until I told them I would be calling the police for theft.""

They finally listened to her and looked at the tapes, and what do you know? She DID drop off the item to return back to us!
 
I went through our normal procedure for this and the delivery company did an investigation, but the customer wanted to chat a bit more about it. Really wanted to express her hatred for this delivery service. She then said something that I hold very dearly to my heart.

Guy asks me what political party I support after I told him we won't tow his vehicle without plates,"I just needed to post this as a way to vent cause even though it happened yesterday, I'm still ticked at this guy.

So, I work in ERS as a dispatcher. There was a call on our hold garage (the garage we send calls to when it requires us to actually read the notes or when it's not ready to be sent to a garage yet) I was looking at the notes to see what was going on with it and saw that one of our garages was already out there and wouldn't tow it because it didn't have plates. It's against company policy to tow a vehicle without plates. If the tags expired within the last 60 days we'll allow it but anything past that we won't touch it.

Well after talking to the garage, I called the guy. He started off nice but that was just a front I guess. I was trying to explain why we wouldn't tow it but he wouldn't let me talk. He kept talking about how he just bought it and it broke down when he was driving it home, the old owner has a lien on it that he has to pay off before the member was able to get it in his name, per the governor, he had until December 1st to transfer plates from his good vehicle to this vehicle, he used to be a dispatcher for some company so he knows the law and just going on and on about all that I listed above. He kept telling me to go to some website because it said on there he had until December 1st. 

Just overall being rude by talking over me and not letting me explain anything. Because the thing is....it doesn't matter what the law was saying...this had to do with our policy's and not anything to do with the law. Which I tried explaining to him. 

Now something you should know about me is I rarely hang up on customers when they're being abusive. I think I've become desensitized to it and it doesn't bother me. Also, I try to avoid interrupting customers and let them say what it is that they want to say. This guy got so bad though and I knew it wasn't going anyways so I had no choice but to talk over him. He still wouldn't listen. I think this is when he realized that I wasn't going to go down without a fight so it devolved into craziness. 

He started asking me if I was a republican, or democratic, which I shut down right away and reminded him it had nothing to do with his call. He then went off on some tangent about how all the garages in that area are gun wielding white supremacist and a bunch of other bull that I wasn't really listening to. 

It turned into an argument between him and I because during all this he kept flip flopping and saying that the vehicle has good plates, the tags aren't expired and then would turn around and say it doesn't have plates. Finally, I realized that he meant his GOOD vehicle had good plates and he was going to take the plates from his good vehicle and put them on the bad vehicle and he felt he was allowed because the governor said he had until December 1st to get it transferred. Um no. Not how that works. Even if that was allowed, it's still against our policy. We won't touch a vehicle that we know has the plates for another vehicle. 

Now remember how I said that I can handle being cussed at and called names? Yeah well my kryptonite is when someone is condescending to me. That's a quick way to piss me off. 

Well after, he realized that I wasn't giving up he started talking to me like a child and started saying things like ""listen here little girl"" or ""now little girl...."" and that was my boiling point. I stopped being nice and told him flat out that he needs to stop calling me little girl and talk to me respectfully. If he can't, I'll hang up. 

Thankfully, this is when he asked for a manager and I'm sure if you listen to the recording you'd be able to here the glee in my voice when I told him I'd get one right away. I ended up transferring him and he pulled the same crap with my team lead and asking her where she lived and a bunch of other bull. 

He ended up calling back because she hung up on him and he placed another call and requested that we not send the same garage. Joke was on him though because we sent the same exact garage and he ended up having to wait a couple hours because they ended up taking long tows so he had to wait for a driver to be back in the area. 

And I'm assuming he ended up getting temp tags because they did end up towing him.

They put me in the wrong queue on my first day.,"This actually happened today and I thought it was funny enough for this place.

So, a few weeks back I started a new WHM job at an IT call center. An important thing to note is that the client has 4 companies, but my site mostly provides service to 3 of them. The 4th is managed mostly by the client itself in Canada and the little support we provide is mostly by our tier 2 agents, a.k.a., the experts. The fourth company's name is SCI, by the way. This is important.

Anyway, today was the day when we'd finally take calls and it was hell. My calls were about troubleshooting software that I'd never heard of, helping with the migration to Office 365, and tracking down techs so I could give an update to the callers (all of which were managers and above). On top of that, the ticketing system we're supposed to use wasn't working for me because I couldn't find the users with the employee ID they'd give me.

After 4 hours I was about to give up. I was panicking because the calls were harder than I thought and I was way over my head. Whose bright idea was it to take this job when I'm not tech savvy? I was also worried because the training had been done remotely and maybe I'd missed something important. I felt like a total failure.

So, I was about to send an email to my supervisor letting them know how this wasn't for me and I was gonna quit when I received a message from one of the trainers.

Trainer: ""I was trying to find the ticket for that report on the rude technician but I couldn't find it. Do you have the employee ID?""

Me: ""Sure, it's SCI-xxxx.""

Trainer ""SCI? Like the company we don't actually service?""

Me: ""... the what?""

Trainer: ""Finish that call and get off the phone. Your credentials might be wrong so we have to fix them.""

It turns out that since I have a very common name they gave me the wrong skills and I was taking calls from the wrong queue for almost 5 hours. Eventually they fixed it and I went from almost crying to laughing at how ridiculous the whole thing was.

If the situation was reversed, and we borrowed money from a card member, you can bet they would want interest if we didn’t pay it all back on time!

Lady doesn’t understand how our device payment plan process works,"So I work for a small-ish wireless company that’s only in a certain area of the country. When it comes to the customer base..... they aren’t the brightest. And the store reps do NOT help matters either, they give out the wrong info all the time and I have to do everything to correct it constantly. 

Had a lady call in, stating she had been charged three times for her watch DPP. I look at her bill, and I immediately know she’s confused. She had payment 23 of 24, and 1 of 24. Check the history for the line, see she got a new watch about a week before her billing cycle ended. Explained to her that, no she wasn’t charged twice. One was for her old watch. The other for her new watch. She insists that she was, and that she had paid off her watch in store. I tried explaining to her that the way we do DPPs is simple: start of the billing cycle, the DPP is automatically added to the bill. So in the systems eyes, that payment is done. So if payment 23 is auto added, and you go in and pay 24, then it is paid off, but because of how it works, it’ll show up on the bill for that cycle. I also tried explaining that regardless of when you get a new device. It will appear on the bill for that cycle. 

Apparently I was “wrong” because she insists that it’s not supposed to show up until the next bill. Then she goes off about making sure she got her promos applied to her new phone dpp, because she insisted she got charged full price. Check the promo, reassure that it’s there. And that it doesn’t kick in all at once, rather it applies every month to reduce the dpp payment. She didn’t make a fuss about seeing the dpp for her phone on the bill though (amazing what they pick and choose to whine about). But she kept insisting that I hand her over to a supervisor because she shouldn’t have been charged 3 times. Was more than happy to do so, and last I saw, the supervisor had a hard time trying to explain the process to her.",125,0,0,"Lady doesn’t understand how our device payment plan process works So I work for a small-ish wireless company that’s only in a certain area of the country.

Why is my total bigger than what I paid? I used a gift card?,"The title pretty much sums it up. I get the notification, a chat came in. I start with the “Thank you for contacting ***! How can I help you?” 

“Yes, I just got my order confirmation, and the total on the email is way different than what the pay screen said. I used two coupons and a gift card.”

Don't abuse people who have control over your essential services,"So this didn't happen to me so I'm a bit scant on details but I thought this was too good for me to not post it here

So I work for a big telecom in the UK in their cancellations team. Surprisingly, the vast majority of people we speak to are actually pretty reasonable or at the very least non abusive.

Anyway they eventually finish the call after 15 minutes of this, but my teammate lets our manager know about what happened. Our manager takes his details (number/name), and proceeds to disconnect *all three* remaining lines on his account.

So because this guy was an asshole, he's now lost his numbers forever and has no phone functionality until he's able to sort out sim cards from another provider.

Guy acts like a dick and had to pay double of what he could have paid,"So this happened awhile ago but I just stopped another guy from doing the same thing so was thinking about it. (Thankfully this member was a lot easier than the previous guy) It's not as interesting, I feel, as some of my other stories but is a good example as to why you shouldn't be a dick to people. 

So if you haven't seen one of my other posts, I work in emergency roadside assistance (ERS) as a dispatcher. I work for a well known company where you can purchase a membership. We have 3 different levels but no matter which level you purchase, the rules for what is and isn't covered are the same. 

One of the things we don't cover is something we call a piggy back tow. A piggy back tow is when a member calls in and places a call going a certain distance that's within their covered limit (max is 100 unless you have top and then you get 1 200mile tow) and then when that tow is finished they place another call going farther. They do this so they don't have to pay any over mile fees. This is not covered though. You get one tow per breakdown and if you need to go over your covered amount of miles, you have to pay for every mile over. 

Well about a year ago now this guy had a call placed. What we didn't realize was that the tow destination was for a convenience store. This is the first red flag because why would you tow to a convenience store???

So the garage goes out and tows the vehicle to where the member has to go. It about 50 miles I believe. 

Some time goes by, we forget about the call and I'm updating members. I open a call and for some reason decided to look and see if there was anything in the notes and this is when I see that the member was requesting a specific garage and that that garage was already OL.

Problem was that this garage was 50 miles away from this member so it didn't make sense why they were requesting them or why that garage was even in the area. So I looked up his call history and this is when I see he had a previous call. 

The original was going 50 miles and the new call was going about 100 miles. The guy was only covered for 100 though. So I put 2 and 2 together and realized he was piggy backing. 

So before calling him I called the garage and let them know that this guy isn't covered for another tow and they're gonna have to charge him. They say okay they'll let that driver know and hang up. It's a good thing I called them first. 

So I call the member to explain that he can't piggy back and he'll have to pay for the 2nd tow. Whelp. I barley had a chance to even utter the words ""not covered"" before he went OFF. He wasn't yelling or anything but from the way he was talking, he was an ass. 

His whole thing was because the person that took his call put the call through, we had to honor it and that the driver was already towing it and we can't back out now and just being really condescending/rude. If you've ever had to deal with someone who wasn't yelling/being asshole but just wouldn't let you talk, talking to you like you're an idiot then you know what I was dealing with. 

He had me so mad just with the way he was talking that my blood pressure shot up and my arms were shaking and it takes a lot to get me like that. 

But I digress. 

I was trying to explain to him that it doesn't matter if the person that took his call didn't say anything, they were from another club and therefore couldn't' see that he had placed a call earlier today or I'm sure they would have told him no and even if they did see and didn't say anything, just because you got past them doesn't mean we have to just honor it. 

He would not stop repeating that over and over. He seriously thought that because he was able to place the 2nd call without anyone saying to him it wasn't covered, that he ""won"" and that we were required to honor the tow and cover it anyways and that the garage was already towing it. 

This is why I'm glad I called the garage first. I told him that I already spoke with the garage and explained it wasn't covered and they'll be calling him shortly to arrange payment. He didn't care though and eventually, I had to transfer him to a supervisor who told him the same thing and wouldn't budge on it. 

The thing is though he ended up screwing himself by being a dick. Because while we couldn't just allow the second tow, we could have saved him some money.

If the driver gets to the tow destination and the member changes their mind and wants to go somewhere else and they haven't dropped the vehicle yet, the driver can take them to the new address and they won't get charged for a second call because it hadn't been dropped yet so is tech considered the same tow. 

If he had been nice we could have just pretended that the driver hadn't dropped the vehicle yet and had the driver continue the tow to the new destination and the member would have only had to pay for the miles going over the 100 miles. But because he was a dick I wasn't about to tell him that loophole. So he was towed and covered for 50 miles and ended up having to pay the driver a hook up fee and pay for 100 miles. If he had been nice though he could have been covered for his full 100 miles and only had to pay for 50 miles. 

&amp;#x200B;

So moral of the story? Don't be a dick.

P.S. If this is confusing, I'm sorry. I was trying to explain it in a way that made sense.",20,0,0,"Guy acts like a dick and had to pay double of what he could have paid So this happened awhile ago but I just stopped another guy from doing the same thing so was thinking about it. (Thankfully this member was a lot easier than the previous guy) It's not as interesting, I feel, as some of my other stories but is a good example as to why you shouldn't be a dick to people. 

So if you haven't seen one of my other posts, I work in emergency roadside assistance (ERS) as a dispatcher. I work for a well known company where you can purchase a membership. We have 3 different levels but no matter which level you purchase, the rules for what is and isn't covered are the same. 

One of the things we don't cover is something we call a piggy back tow. A piggy back tow is when a member calls in and places a call going a certain distance that's within their covered limit (max is 100 unless you have top and then you get 1 200mile tow) and then when that tow is finished they place another call going farther. They do this so they don't have to pay any over mile fees. This is not covered though. You get one tow per breakdown and if you need to go over your covered amount of miles, you have to pay for every mile over. 

Well about a year ago now this guy had a call placed. What we didn't realize was that the tow destination was for a convenience store. This is the first red flag because why would you tow to a convenience store???

So the garage goes out and tows the vehicle to where the member has to go. It about 50 miles I believe. 

Some time goes by, we forget about the call and I'm updating members. I open a call and for some reason decided to look and see if there was anything in the notes and this is when I see that the member was requesting a specific garage and that that garage was already OL.

Problem was that this garage was 50 miles away from this member so it didn't make sense why they were requesting them or why that garage was even in the area. So I looked up his call history and this is when I see he had a previous call. 

The original was going 50 miles and the new call was going about 100 miles. The guy was only covered for 100 though. So I put 2 and 2 together and realized he was piggy backing.

"Racist women demands credit and when refused, she plays the Sax","A little of backstory, so I work in a escalations team in a ISP from the US but we are located in Mexico, basically we took calls that require a supervisor, my job is try to descalate the call and try to make deals with the customers or educate them in the best way possible why we  cant fullfil some of their requests.
Usually this escalations are through chat, so the agent will contact us in that way and explain the situation, we try to give some advice to the agents to try to descalate the situation without the transfer.
Today I had an agent on the chat telling that a customer was demanding a 1 year credit of services because she had and outage of 1 hour and spoke previosly with another agent that told her this info, but the service never came back, so we did the usual and scheduled a tech appointment for next day as it was already late and no techs were availabale, but she insisted and wanted to talk with a supervisor, so I took the call becaus I knew this was about to get fun. I know this was not one of my best jobs but if pwople want respect, the need ro respect you first.

M: Hi, my name is OP and Im the supe...
C: ARE YOU THE SUPERVISOR IN CHARGE??? I NEED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT YOUR AGENTS AND HOW THEY LIED TO ME, I NEED A FULL CREDIT OF THE SERVICE ON THIS YEAR
(Yes, she was yelling the whole time)
M: Im sorry to hear about it, as I had understood from my agent, theres was an outage but the services never cameback, correct? And we already have a tech appointment as soon as possible for you
C: THAT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME, I NEED MY SERVICES NOW AND A FULL CREDIT OF THIS YEAR BECAUSE THE FIRST AGENT TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD COME BACK ON ABOUT AN HOUR AGO BUT NOTHING HAPPENED
M: Again C, we are really sorry about it, I cant offer you a 1 year credit but I can offer you 25 dlr credit for the inconvenience of today and will be reflected on your next bill.

She keeps insisting about the credit and I denied in the most polite way and offered continusly my deal wirh some extra perks and then she dropped the bomb.

C: ARE YOU MEXICAN? BECAUSE I CAN HEAR YOUR ACCENT
M: Yes M'm, Im indeed.
C: OH SO YOU ARE A RACIST, MISOGINIST AND SEXIST THAT DOESNT KNOW HOW TO TREAT WOMEN EDUCATED LIKE ME
At this point, I was losing my patience
M: Im sorry, im doing my best possible right now for you
C: SO, HELP ME OUT OR SEND ME TO CORPORATE BECAUSE YOU BEANERS DONT KNOW HOW RO TREAT A LADY AND YOU ONLY SEE THE WOMEN AS A OBJECT TO REPRODUCE YOURSELFS
M: Im really sorry, but are you listening to yourself, you are being the racist and If we dont keep this professional, I will need to release this call.
C: HOW DARE YOU TO TALK TO ME LIKE THAT, I WILL GET YOU FIRED, YOU ARE NOT RELEASING THE CALL, TRANSFER ME TO CORPORATE
M: Im sorry but I cant, I dont have the option foe, if you want to talk with an American you can release the call and try your luck.
C: I KNOW YOU CAN AND I WILL WAIT FOR YOU TO DO IT.
M: Do as you please

At this moment I was allowed to release the call, but for the lolz I stayed on the line and I didnt regret it. It was silent for about 10 minutes, she ocasionally asking if I was there and if I would transfer her with the same response, then she said:
C: Okay so if you are not going to transfee me, I will make noise.
So she LITERALLY starts to play the saxophone in the most awful way possible, but I muted myself and started to laugh my ass off, and she went like that for about 5 minutes only to stop to say""LOOK HOW EDUCATED IM, YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO BE AS EDUCATED AS ME YOU BEANER"", I just couldnt stop laughing, until she realized that I wouldnt transfer her and she dropped the call.

It’s a check.,"First time writing in here and I will make it short. I work in the financial industry and take calls for a number of functions, today I had my worst caller in a while so I figured I’d share [people avoid giving you a hard time when you are in control of the conversation.]

“Hi my name is ___ can I have your first and last name please?]
After his answer I say, in my usual way as I try to keep my calls uniform “and what can we help you with today?”
We is used as I all the time where I live, it’s just how WE talk. Not really uncommon elsewhere anyways.
So the customer’s response is:
“We are not discussing anything, you and I are talking about information I need.”
Immediately I’m thrown off because of all the things to be set off over a noun which is technically being used correctly should not be one of them.

The same kind of check you would see if you wrote one to a friend or family. So I explain this to him and he continues to give me grief until eventually he asks what other payment options he could use, I inform him of a few methods including a money order OR a cashier’s check [cashiers checks are not generally considered to be checks as they are counted as cash.] Now hearing the word check after being told there is only one kind of check unleashes his inner Karen and he proceeds to borate me for several minutes [tanking my handle time btw seeing as it is a Saturday so things are slow.] and eventually asking me to have a manager call him. I inform him I can open a complaint case and escalate it to our management team in an attempt to rectify whatever the issue may be, I would simply need his phone number. At this point the customer continues to berate me and eventually hangs up without giving me contact information, so I file his complaint as anonymous and notice an email from my team lead, who apparently was listening in on my call.

I inform him I can open a complaint case and escalate it to our management team in an attempt to rectify whatever the issue may be, I would simply need his phone number. At this point the customer continues to berate me and eventually hangs up without giving me contact information, so I file his complaint as anonymous and notice an email from my team lead, who apparently was listening in on my call. No subject, just in the message box: “It’s a check...” 

Maybe not the most interesting call but I thought I would share my minor victory as that email turned a terrible moment into a fulfilling one."

"Surprise, doctors need to get paid too.","Background: I work for a company that bills for physicians because everyone's a contractor these days. Most ER's split the bills so we handle the physician's side of things.

""Yessir. A doctor treated you. He's employed by us. In order for him to get paid, we need you to pay his bill.""

""BUT I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. I DONT HAVE TO PAY FOR A DOCTOR.""

Woman tried to sue us for her awful driving meaning she drove into a lamppost,"So I used to work in the call centre for my local council. So would take calls about school places, roads, grass that hasn't been cut.... things like that. Occasionally we would get people try to put in insurance claims against the council for things like tripping over uneven paving slabs, burst tyres due to potholes etc.

We once had a crazy lady call and say she had just reversed into one of the streetlights on a public road. So I said okay no worries if you can let me know whereabouts the light is I can put a report through to ask an engineer to go and have a look at the damage and assess if it needs repairing and I thanked her for letting us know. Assumed that would be it, she then proceeded to say ""I didn't call to report the damage to the streetlight, I called about the damage to my car"". I asked her what exactly she was requesting from us as at this point I was a bit confused. She literally said she would like me to send out information to her in the post about how she can put in a claim against us for the damage to her car because it was apparently our fault for putting the streetlight there, and threatened legal action due to our ""negligence""...

Throughout this whole conversation she failed to accept that there was no possible way the LA would accept liability for damage to her car because she drove into a lamppost, as there is no possible way the council were responsible for the damage purely because we ""put the streetlight there in the first place"" as she claimed....

I don't really remember what happened after, I think I transferred her to a supervisor as she refused to take no for an answer. Probably one of most WTF phone calls I took in my short time working at a call centre, every now and then I wonder how far she got with that claim in the end...

Most ungrateful customer ever!,"My old job was a small Debt Consolidation Program. I hated it because the clients (customers) would think it’s our fault they got themselves in a huge debt.

NO, you owe it to your bank and if you don’t pay it does not hurt us. 

Me: Hello, thank you for calling ... may I have your Client ID number? ... Thank you, how can I help you?

Customer: Hello, I was calling about my payments. 

Me: Yes, I see your account is past due. If you miss any more payments your creditors may drop off of the program and you would have to pay at full payments and high interest rate. 

Customer: I know, I’m struggling making the payments. I have so much to pay for and I don’t want my creditors to drop off. Is there any way the payments can be lower? 

Me: I’m sorry to hear that. Well it would be up for the creditors to lower it. They already lowered the payments and interest rate when accepting the proposal. What changed in your budget?

What is Wrong with you?,"Reading something about the cable company I used to work for reminded me of this. It was a pretty big news item at the time, but I can't find anything about it anymore, so I don't know who knows the story nowadays, so here we go.

Our call center had an agent, sat about 20 feet from me (internet tech support) back in... oh about 2005, give or take a year, who had a big damned argument with a customer. I don't know if I ever knew the details of that argument, and just forgot or not, but that part isn't relevant besides that the agent was really pissed at the customer.  Which doesn't in the least make it justified, but he went into our email support tools and decided to change their email address to a really obscene thing to do with children that I'm absolutely not going to type out here.

The Crazy Just Keeps Getting Crazier,"I work in an insurance call center handling complex technical calls and taking escalated calls. Most of my calls are ho-hum technical calls. I handle escalations about billing and underwriting, which are usually a variation of ""how dare you tell me that you won't insure me for free."" The call I'm about to describe is one of my personal favorite deviations from the norm in recent memory.

Your intrepid writer logs into her phone. Two minutes into her shift comes her very first call. An escalation from a relatively new vendor rep complaining that she's been on the phone with this guy for an hour. It took him an hour to get to the point of asking to hear my lovely voice. Sure, send him on over.

The customer, it turns out, is wondering whether insurance follows the vehicle or the driver. I explain that the answer is technically both, depending on which coverage and the situation. It stems from the fact that his insurance agent excluded his wife from coverage. He is not happy with nuance and wants a one-or-the-other answer. He then goes on to provide a very specific example:

""So, if Jeff Bezos drives my car....""

So many questions. One, how are we getting to use Jeff Bezos as an example for this? Two, why on earth would Jeff Bezos want to drive your 1996 Toyota Tercel? Three, do you really think this is ever going to be an actual situation you'll encounter? Four, you know that Jeff Bezos does not live anywhere near you, sir, right? Five, did you listen to the first part of the question you're asking me?

It only gets more ridiculous. He then wants to know about letting someone drive his vehicle. I explain the concept of *permissive* use. (For those of you who don't know, permissive use means lending your vehicle to someone who is not listed on your policy. How insurers treat it may vary depending on your insurer, your state, and various other minutiae.)

""So, there's coverage following the vehicle. This means that I need an exclusion form for every person on the planet, right? Do I need to exclude Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerburg?""

My response: ""Sir, as long as you're not allowing every person on earth to drive your Toyota Tercel, you should be fine. It's far easier to tell Jeff, Mark, Bill and Elon no when they ask to drive that Tercel than it is for us to send you approximately seven billion copies of an exclusion form.""

Obviously, we had to get the client to agree in getting a callback from the employer/school, but we were instructed to have the client to say yes. Not a ""yeah"", not a ""mmhmm"", not a ""uh huh"", an actual ""yes"". It got real annoying dealing with people that all but flat out refused to say yes, but would say everything else that was a stand in for a yes. Is it like that in other call centers?"
The mute button is not the customers friend,"At a previous call center I worked they wanted us to use the mute button instead of hold.  I did not like doing that unless I was doing a fraud dispute (this way I can hear if they said something wrong).  I had a member call to get a credit back on her credit card.  I asked her to hold while I reviewed her account to see what we could do.  I decided to use the mute button since I knew the hold would be verify short.  I had one button to push to give her the credit when all of the sudden I here her say to someone in the background:  ""I have another N-word on the phone.""  

I paused.  Took her off mute and told her ""Ma'am, I heard that.  You can call back.""  

While she was trying to come up with an apology I hung up on her.  That was the first and only time I have ever hung up on a customer.  I made sure to detail her account about what she said to make it harder to get a credit from the next person.  

Moral of the story:  If you don't hear hold music you are not on a true hold.  Watch your mouth.  Also, customers need to take into considerations that the person you are talking to may have your SSN, DON, Address, and your job information.   And they might be a little crazy.",1660,0,0,"The mute button is not the customers friend At a previous call center I worked they wanted us to use the mute button instead of hold.

I do not understand the thinking of some customers,"For people who work in call centers for cell carriers, how often do you get calls from customers who want to transfer service to a new phone, but they are talking on that line and do not have another available?

Work From Home Burnout?,"When work from home first started, I was stoked. I had been with the company I work for for a few years and mid- March of this year, our office became 100% remote. I had been working from home, one day a week previously, to provide me a bit of flexibility.  Now with working remote 100% of the time, it gave me so many benefits!

\-No commuting

\-PJ's all day if I wanted (currently do this only  once a week)

\-Getting stuff done around the house.

\-Take a nap if I need/want on my break/lunch

\-Working out/walking the dog on my breaks

Now we are in November, and while I don't dread working from home, I feel that there would be an inevitable burnout at some point. At the end of the day, I close the door to my office and it is as if the room doesn't exist until the next work day. I do miss seeing my co-workers and only so much can be done via Teams chat and all as far as team building. 

Now if I was given the choice to remain WFH or return to the office, I would choose WFH 100%. At this point it is looking like it will stay this way (at least for my team), but if 2020 has taught us anything, it is that things can change in an instant).

Call handling process for rude/racist callers,"I just need to get this off my chest.  

Years ago, I worked in a company that handled outsourced call centre jobs from the US, and I was assigned to in a US Telco account. Thing is, once the customer hears my accent (I am not an American), some take it as their cue to be racist and/or rude. One particular caller said to me, “Are you from the United States? I don’t want to talk to stupid monkeys, I want to speak to an American.”  

The thing about this telco company is that they wouldn’t allow the agents to hang up on those abusive callers, and I even remember one new agent bursting into tears when she was forced to continue with the call with such a customer. She quit shortly after that incident.  

I worked in that account for a bit over two years until I resigned and found another post in another call centre, this time one handling multinational customers. This company has such process that allowed us to give three warnings if the caller becomes abusive/nasty/racist, and if the said caller did it several times, the managers have the power to block that number off the system. Needless to say, I loved that job more, and performed well until I got promoted to a higher post.  

I am just curious, why would some companies allow abusive callers to say whatever they want and these said companies would rather protect those callers than the people who work for them? That put me off telco call centres so much that after moving to another country, when that was all the customer service job that I could get, I decided to do an entirely different job.",27,0,0,"Call handling process for rude/racist callers I just need to get this off my chest.

This happened about 20 years ago,when I worked in a UK call centre for an international rail service, booking tickets for journeys between 3 different European cities. It was also around the time that budget airlines really took off (pun intended).
I had a customer (f) call me up to enquire the price of a day return ticket from City A to City B. After confirming her preferred date of travel I was able to offer a price of £69.00 total. She responded by saying that she can get a flight for 50 pence each way. My first thought was ""Well why the @#$! are you phoning me?"". I went through the usual routine of asking whether that included airport taxes, transfers, etc, also taking the time to remind her that we operated to and from the city centre, whilst the airline would probably fly to a minor  out of the way airport that nobody has ever heard of. No, she was adamant her trip would cost her £1, if she flew, and what could I do about our price? Well, our prices were set in stone - we had no discretion whatsoever, which I told her. After a few more minutes of back and forth I had to tell her that if price was her main criteria for picking a mode of transport that she should book the flights, but please call me back if I could be of any further help.

Deal with micromanaging or angry customer service calls?,"So I started working at this call center for health insurance. I’ve worked sales before in gyms and even had to deal with call leads. I initially applied to verifcation specialist but they moved me to Customer Service since the VS department is mostly women... anyway, the first few days, the guy whose suppose to train me and this other dude isnt doing his job so the head boss has our main supervisor teach us the works in about 1 day with rest of week ready for us. Easy stuff in the end, just gotta call or pick up phone for payment declines, explain benefits, angry calls and save cancellations if possible. We were getting a good hang of it.

Then on Monday, not everyone went to work due to heavy flooding from a storm. The head boss was the first in the office and I was the second. Suddenly he moves me outside to do Front calling. He tells me to follow the script, translate in spanish if needed, and to ask questions if needed as well. Also to shadow the best sales agent (Bruce) whose been there two months and started off like myself. I had about 8 calls, 3 leads, and 1 sale for my first day. Bruce gave me tips, was patient and kind throughout the day. The head boss gave me tips on what to say as well on a few leads but only one of those got closed while others were broke. Him and the two other agents there were satisfied with how I did for my first time doing Front and asked me if I wanted to stay. I said “yes”.

Next day, Tuesday. Everyone is in the office. I get my assigned seat, get immediately to work. I almost made a sale within first 30 min but computer glitched out and the client didnt pick up phone after. The computers then had connection issues throughout day so I had to refresh the page constantly. The sales office manager, my new supervisor, sat me next to Bruce so I can be under his wing. Again, gave me tips and was patient with questions. Now this is where things got a bit pressuring....

The call monitor was here today so he was on top of my calls 24/7. Even interrupting some calls I was in the middle of to correct me on something or to say properly something to the client. And to heavily follow the script and no stray off it. Avoid saying “like” “um” “i mean”. He said I was doing good since I have high energy while talking but to slow down script and that he is only trying to help me out. He got on top of me about 15 times today. Mind you, for things that not even Bruce, office manager or the head boss complained about when they were listening to my calls.  It got to the point where the later half of the day I just lost confidence and was super careful on certain calls. Even skipped a few where I knew he would say something about. 

Later during lunch break, I walk past him and the front desk rep talking about my performance and how I don’t listen and not filling out the Front forms right. I only missed 3 details on the form which suprisingly Bruce or the head boss never corrected me on. I even overheard the office manager getting a bit aggravated. Day ends, head boss has meetting with us about a fresh sales agent who nearly lost a sale since the client didnt believe she was an agent but an operator. My old supervisor had to save it

My old supervisor asked my new one how I did. He said I had 5 leads and made 2 sales. And that I did better than the other front person who had no successful call the entire day. Old Supe then said that doing Front is good easy money and good start to being a licensed agent.

Lately, I’ve been thinking it over. I plan on going back to school for my Bachelors in January 2021. So I won’t be staying long since its full time, they don’t know that yet. I mainly got it to help the bills in the mean time. Thats the thing, I don’t know if in the mean time I should stick with Front or CS. I was planning on talking to old supe tomorrow about the situation.

I can wait out till end of week to make final decision but if the call monitor gonna continue micro managing like this, I understand its his job but if he has to complain behind my back and hinder my performance like this after only 2 days of being suddenly switched departments, it may not be the right position for me and I would rather have my bearings in CS. Even the other dude working CS changed his mind about working the floor after dealing with similar treatment. And he was only put there for 2 hours just to see how it feels working there.

"""If you were in front of me, I'd throw my phone right in your face!""","tl;dr customer thought the base rate was the total due of the reservation, demands that I issue a full refund and waive the cancellation fees while being a complete ass... yeah, no.

I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

This customer is going to travel to EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport) tomorrow, and paid in advance for his rental. Problem is that when he called to give us his frequent flyer number, he realized (much to his horror) that the price of his rental increased. Like many of the customers I have to deal with, it was my company's fault that he was so distracted that he couldn't see the taxes and fees on the website (which appear two times before requesting your credit card information).

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C: Customer

H: Thank you for calling Rental Car Company, my name is HenriquesDumbCousin and I'm a supervisor for reservations, may I have your name?

C: Customer.

H: Thank you very much, how can I assist you?

C: I'm calling to cancel the reservation I just did and **you will issue me a full refund.**

I don't know if I've mentioned this in the past, but I hate when the customer tries to tell me how to do my job. Whatever, let's see what's going on.

H: Do you have your confirmation number?

The customer gives me the confirmation number, clearly frustrated because he gave it to the previous agent and it was a cold transfer, so I didn't know what was going on.

C: Your agent told me that he couldn't honor the rate I was promised, so you'll cancel this and issue a full refund.

H: What was the original...?

C: Excuse me! I was promised a rate on the website, after that I called to attach my frequent flyer number to earn some miles, and I was informed that you wouldn't honor the what's on the website, so I want you to cancel the reservation.

H: *Charming*... What was the original rate?

C: 283 USD

I see the reservation, and indeed, **the base rate was 283 USD**, but with taxes and fees included, the rate increased to 440 USD.

H: That's just the base rate, without any taxes and fees.

C: No, that's the price of the reservation, and since you're unwilling to honor that rate, I want all my money back right now.

H: I can cancel the reservation, but if I do that, there will be a cancellation fee.

C: So not only you refuse to honor the price I was promised, you're telling me that you're going to, excuse my french, fuck me over?

Okay... I shouldn't have the said the following...

H: That's not French...

C: Excuse me!

H: Ce n'est pas français...

This guy continues to demand that we honor the **REAL** price or that I issue a full refund for his reservation.

C: I'm asking you to take control of the situation and do the right thing.

H: I'm taking control of the situation, sir. If I cancel the reservation, there will be a Cancellation Fee.

C: Who do you work for? For the customer or for the company?

H: ... I work for the company, sir. I have to follow their policies.

C: So you don't care that you're company is screwing with good people, loyal customers. You have no honor! You're dishonorable, you have no honor!

While this dumbass was calling me names, I was verifying if other locations would have less expensive vehicles available, their schedules, stuff that may help this guy.

H: Maybe if you pick up the car...

C: Excuse me!

H: No, sir...

C: Excuse me, as I was telling you...

H: No, sir, I'm done with you interrupting me, now you're going to listen to me. I'm looking at other locations in the area, for example, downtown, we may be able to lower the rate if you go there.

C: And how am I going there? Is there a shuttle? Are you going to pay for my taxi?

H: No, sir.

C: Man, why do you guys insist in screwing me up.

Continues to say that the website only showed the 283 USD

H: I'm on the website right now, I'm making a dummy reservation and it clearly shows me the taxes and fees, sir.

C: You know what, what's your e-mail? I'm going to send you a screenshot!

H: Rental Car Company @...

C: NO! WHAT'S YOUR E-MAIL?

H: I'm not going to share that information with you, sir.

More bickering, it's been almost ten minutes, and this guy comes with this **brilliant** solution.

C: Let's do the following HenriquesDumbCousin, cancel my reservation and issue a full refund, then you can make me another reservation for 283 USD, how about that?

H: ... that's not how things work, sir.

C: You listen to me, if you were in front of me, I'd throw my phone right in your face!

H: Uh-huh... I do apologize sir, but I don't answer to threats, have a nice evening.

*Click*

He would constantly repeat throughout the call that he was a loyal customer over and over, so I got curious and looked for previous rentals under his name, and unsurprisingly, there wasn't a single reservation under his name in the past 12 months.

I did find out, though, that before he talked to me, he had already called and talked with another unfortunate soul. Based on the notes of the previous agent he spoke with, he started yelling at the agent right away. 

That poor agent closed his notes with, and I quote:

*Customer called me c@ck@@ suck@@r mf and hung up.*

Yeah, *charming fella...*

**FAQ**

**I don't understand, what's with this ""Cancellation Fee""?**

You have the option to pay at the counter or pay in advance. Normally, if you pay in advance, you can save a decent amount of money.

Please be aware that if you pay in advance and choose to cancel the reservation at any point (one minute after creating it, one month before the pick up, it doesn't matter) there's going to be a cancellation fee. 

Many people tell me that it doesn't say that in the website, and I always tell them the same: It's right above the check box you clicked before paying, the once that says ""I have read the terms and conditions"". It's a rather big box, clearly visible.",339,0,0,"""If you were in front of me, I'd throw my phone right in your face!"" tl;dr customer thought the base rate was the total due of the reservation, demands that I issue a full refund and waive the cancellation fees while being a complete ass... yeah, no.

I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

This customer is going to travel to EWR (Newark Liberty International Airport) tomorrow, and paid in advance for his rental. Problem is that when he called to give us his frequent flyer number, he realized (much to his horror) that the price of his rental increased. Like many of the customers I have to deal with, it was my company's fault that he was so distracted that he couldn't see the taxes and fees on the website (which appear two times before requesting your credit card information).

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C: Customer

H: Thank you for calling Rental Car Company, my name is HenriquesDumbCousin and I'm a supervisor for reservations, may I have your name?

C: Customer.

H: Thank you very much, how can I assist you?

C: I'm calling to cancel the reservation I just did and **you will issue me a full refund.**

I don't know if I've mentioned this in the past, but I hate when the customer tries to tell me how to do my job. Whatever, let's see what's going on.

H: Do you have your confirmation number?

The customer gives me the confirmation number, clearly frustrated because he gave it to the previous agent and it was a cold transfer, so I didn't know what was going on.

C: Your agent told me that he couldn't honor the rate I was promised, so you'll cancel this and issue a full refund.

H: What was the original...?

C: Excuse me! I was promised a rate on the website, after that I called to attach my frequent flyer number to earn some miles, and I was informed that you wouldn't honor the what's on the website, so I want you to cancel the reservation.

H: *Charming*... What was the original rate?

C: 283 USD

I see the reservation, and indeed, **the base rate was 283 USD**, but with taxes and fees included, the rate increased to 440 USD.

H: That's just the base rate, without any taxes and fees.

C: No, that's the price of the reservation, and since you're unwilling to honor that rate, I want all my money back right now.

H: I can cancel the reservation, but if I do that, there will be a cancellation fee.

C: So not only you refuse to honor the price I was promised, you're telling me that you're going to, excuse my french, fuck me over?

Okay... I shouldn't have the said the following...

H: That's not French...

C: Excuse me!

H: Ce n'est pas français...

This guy continues to demand that we honor the **REAL** price or that I issue a full refund for his reservation.

C: I'm asking you to take control of the situation and do the right thing.

H: I'm taking control of the situation, sir. If I cancel the reservation, there will be a Cancellation Fee.

C: Who do you work for? For the customer or for the company?

H: ... I work for the company, sir. I have to follow their policies.

C: So you don't care that you're company is screwing with good people, loyal customers. You have no honor! You're dishonorable, you have no honor!

While this dumbass was calling me names, I was verifying if other locations would have less expensive vehicles available, their schedules, stuff that may help this guy.

H: Maybe if you pick up the car...

C: Excuse me!

H: No, sir...

C: Excuse me, as I was telling you...

H: No, sir, I'm done with you interrupting me, now you're going to listen to me. I'm looking at other locations in the area, for example, downtown, we may be able to lower the rate if you go there.

C: And how am I going there? Is there a shuttle? Are you going to pay for my taxi?

H: No, sir.

C: Man, why do you guys insist in screwing me up.

Continues to say that the website only showed the 283 USD

H: I'm on the website right now, I'm making a dummy reservation and it clearly shows me the taxes and fees, sir.

C: You know what, what's your e-mail? I'm going to send you a screenshot!

H: Rental Car Company @...

C: NO! WHAT'S YOUR E-MAIL?

H: I'm not going to share that information with you, sir.

More bickering, it's been almost ten minutes, and this guy comes with this **brilliant** solution.

C: Let's do the following HenriquesDumbCousin, cancel my reservation and issue a full refund, then you can make me another reservation for 283 USD, how about that?

H: ... that's not how things work, sir.

C: You listen to me, if you were in front of me, I'd throw my phone right in your face!

H: Uh-huh... I do apologize sir, but I don't answer to threats, have a nice evening.

*Click*

He would constantly repeat throughout the call that he was a loyal customer over and over, so I got curious and looked for previous rentals under his name, and unsurprisingly, there wasn't a single reservation under his name in the past 12 months.

I did find out, though, that before he talked to me, he had already called and talked with another unfortunate soul. Based on the notes of the previous agent he spoke with, he started yelling at the agent right away. 

That poor agent closed his notes with, and I quote:

*Customer called me c@ck@@ suck@@r mf and hung up.*

Yeah, *charming fella...*

**FAQ**

**I don't understand, what's with this ""Cancellation Fee""?**

You have the option to pay at the counter or pay in advance. Normally, if you pay in advance, you can save a decent amount of money.

Please be aware that if you pay in advance and choose to cancel the reservation at any point (one minute after creating it, one month before the pick up, it doesn't matter) there's going to be a cancellation fee. 

Many people tell me that it doesn't say that in the website, and I always tell them the same: It's right above the check box you clicked before paying, the once that says ""I have read the terms and conditions"". It's a rather big box, clearly visible."
"I'm an accountant, hence I'm right.","Oh phone, formatting, blah blah.

Spoke to a gentleman today who threw down the ultimate card - he works in a field relating to his query.

He came on, admitting he was already annoyed by our automated line not understanding his post code. Now this part, I sympathise with. Accents over here are pretty varied and automatic lines can struggle to understand but that won't lessen the frustration of dealing with them.

I assured him I could take payment over the phone which mollified him. Got through all the basics of security and opening up the payment system but he became incensed when I asked him to type in his card information.

To increase the security of taking payments with agents, our payment system was updated in late 2018. Instead of providing card number and digits from the back and us blanking out the call recording for that section, details are now typed into your phone the middle section of your card and the digits on the back are starred out.

This was to make things more secure for customers and prevent the possibility of details being used by the agent online. Hadn't happened in our company but trying to be security aware.

This man is affronted that I won't type the details in. Explaining I literally can't as it's not designed to work that way does not appease him. He does not believe this is more secure and we are making it impossible to pay his bill. Advised of online and ability to pay in shop, which be ignores and continues to say how inexcusable this is, querying what we would do for customers with the very old style phones with ring, still not liking the other options available, including D/D.

Want's to speak to a manager. I advised I can put him through but they still will not be able to amend to take the payment. States still wants to speak to senior as he is an accountant and knows what is acceptable.

The throwing around of jobs is such a peeve of mine. I truly wanted to ask how it was relevant or call out his bs but I did transfer him to a senior. From her notes he didn't believe her either and threatened to switch.

If anyone is an accountant, would this type of payment system be a concern to you. Or what does everyone think, talking bs because he's already annoyed 

He just struck me as petty since we have so many payment options but this one not being to his taste was a crime... despite having made payment the same way with a colleague in June.",379,0,0,"I'm an accountant, hence I'm right. Oh phone, formatting, blah blah.

You need to go to therapy,"When I was 17 I worked 10pm to 6am at a place that took calls for infomercials. I was also one of the people who took over calls when someone asked for a supervisor. Since we all we did was take the orders we didn’t have access to them after sending the orders.

Me: again, sir, we do not have access to customer information after it is sent. This is to protect the customer’s information. You need to get ahold of the company itself either by calling or by mail.

@ customers: please don't blame us for everything,"This should be common sense and definitely is on this subreddit, but I get to talk to so many ridiculous people daily that I really need to vent about some stuff, I hope you guys don't mind.

Don't assume we have authority over how the processes work. We aren't supervisors or managers, and we risk our quality scores and possibly jobs if we don't follow the procedure. So we aren't refusing to refund you more than $X for your cold food because we hate you and want to rob you, it's because that's the goddamn policy and the system doesn't give us any option above that. 

Don't try to abuse the system to get free food by lying and then get angry at agents for escalating the case to a supervisor. You knew what you were doing, and of course we can see that you're doing it. I get it, we all need some help in life and I wish I got free food as well, but YOU are hurting the restaurants while abusing the vouchers. Whenever we issue a refund for you for your food allegedly being cold, that small local restaurant loses the money because of you. This is why we do this. Not because you don't deserve to eat, but because you need to look at the bigger picture. 

Don't assume you're the only person an agent is speaking to at the time. In peak hours, I get to be on 3 different chats at once, with 3 different people cursing and capslocking at me because their food is 10 minutes late. Please don't make it harder for us, or we're more likely to mess up or straight up leave the chat if you're being incredibly painful to deal with. 

Don't think that you did something by threating us with court, sack or social media. An agent doesn't care about any of that, you cannot make us lose our job unless we actually do something fatally wrong, and you're just gonna be known as ""that idiot"" in our office for the rest of the day.

Don't send me question marks if you see I'm already typing, it's annoying and isn't gonna make me type faster.

Don't ask for $21 if I said it would be $20. This is not Pawn Stars or Storage Battles, I can't increase your refund no matter how much you beg. If you even read the Terms and conditions before you came to demand refund, you could see that you're entitled to nothing except what we offer as a good will.

For god's sake, read my entire fucking message before writing a reply that would require me to repeat everything again. I swear sometimes I think people can't read, and that this is a much bigger problem for them than their can of drink missing from the order.

Please accept that some things take time. No, I can't transfer you to my supervisor right now, because they have a queue of stuff to do and calls to make. You WILL be contacted within x hours if I promise you that.

Leaving a bad rate for an agent - who you can clearly see did their best to help you - is really childish. I understand it's a way to express your frustration, but there is a bit difference between an outright rude/unhelpful agent, and someone who tries their best to be empathetic, even though they don't have an option to do what you want. Please realize this, the ratings affect us personally more than as a whole.

Using bad language will get you nowhere, other than maybe kicked out from the chat because an agent has a right to terminate the conversation if you're being abusive. So no - you are not above us, really, and can't ""make us stay on chat until you get what you want"".

We're not your servants. We're not the thieves who want to rob you either. We're just people who have some tools that can help you, OR at least be there to understand your concerns, and offer a solution, even if the solution isn't exactly what you wanted. Our empathy, as long as you're being reasonable, is not fake. 

The only reasons why sometimes we sound like robots are that either we have to use macros to improve quality score, or we are on multiple chats at the same time and physically cannot manage to write you a heartfelt message. I think that's not even the point of the service. We aren't friends and this is a professional setting. 

I see so many people complaining of ""customer help being a joke"" - it's not a joke, because it's exactly what it is, HELP for customers, and not a Refund Fairytale.

This is a food delivery app I'm talking about, so I definitely understand where people are coming from when they make complaints, and I was in their shoes sometimes. But if I managed to be understanding and polite to agents, and if people I know do the same, it's no excuse for so many entitled shits to act like they do.

Seek professional help if you can't curb your anger over a wrong burger that was compensated to you anyway, and seek a lawyer if you can't deal with not being offered a delivery charge refund, but for fuck's sake, don't assume the person you're speaking to via app at 11PM is either the defendant or the judge.

"""Put me up in a hotel and pay for it""","Oh goodness this one had me frazzled lol 

So I was just starting out taking calls for an electric company. An outage is going on in an area and I get this angry woman who is yelling and telling me that my company is horrible.

I LOVED it. At first. The calls were few and far between my team was awesome and supportive there was always “office” bonding activities despite being a work at home job. 

So I extended my 2 month contract into a 4 month one switching to part time (Im a full time student). Everything is same as always until my department decided they needed our team to assist the WAY busier and more traditional “call center” side of things. We had the proper training, it went from 45 minutes between calls to 10 seconds. It was hard but still within my capabilities. 

Then another 2 weeks passes and another contract for 2 months is signed  and they decide “nope were moving you all to outbound calling” with ZERO training with an entire new program, team, managers. So yesterday is my first day doing outbound calling with no training on gathering info. My manager starts hounding me to be faster and whenever I asked for help she left me on read. Queue a breakdown because I have no fucking clue what I am doing so I email her saying I need training I cant complete these tasks. She leaves me on read. Then starts hounding me about why I cant get work done even though I was not trained with these new systems. So this brings us to now where I have a “discussion” with said manager at 3 (I started at 2) and honestly....I have had enough of being tossed around and this is my last fucking day in a call center. Wish me luck everyone! (I have another job as well so ill be fine)

Update: Phone call with my manager went well :) I am finally free and she said she supports my decision to leave. Thank you all for being so encouraging!! (Also I still have my previous manager as a reference so this worked out perfect;) )",477,0,0,"I’m finally done with this.

Him: yes I'd like to know if you offer wheelchair benefits.

Me: ... no unfortunately your dental insurance would not cover a wheelchair... is there anything else I can help you with?

The call that was the reason I quit,"Never posted on Reddit before so sorry if the formatting is bad or anything like that. This is also a long post so I'm sorry but this has been on my brain for months.

Bit of backstory, I started working at a call centre in June because I needed some money and they were offering work from home positions. The contract, while I obviously can't say exactly what it was, was a large american furniture company. The three weeks of training (yes, three) went by without issue and then after that I started as a full-on agent. On day six of taking calls this call came through that I can not forget. 

I answer the call in my usual way ""Thanks for calling customer care my name is (me), can i get your phone number please?"" (we got phone numbers and accounts up first before asking what we can do.

I ask how I can help them and he tells me ""theres a bit of a problem with my sons bed and we need someone to come and fix it""

I pull up the order, find the one he's talking about and get started on scheduling a repair tech to go out. I needed to know what specifically was going on so I asked ""what's going on with the bed?""

He tells me ""the front rail (it was a daybed) has sunk down and there are 14, yessir 14 nails sticking up out of it. They've torn the mattress apart and they're a safety hazard""

I ask him if anyone got hurt on it. ""My son got scratched very bad on it"" he says. So I start heading for a form for safety concern to fill it out, but the system wasn't working so I just had to schedule it the normal way. 

I get through the notes to scheduling and tell the customer that my first availability is two weeks away. He tells me straight up ""that won't work"". So of course at this point, I'm thinking 'oh great, one of these people that wants me to make things happen out of thin air'. I tell him I have no control over it and he says to me ""my son is non verbal autistic and loves that bed. He will not sleep anywhere else and I cannot have him cutting himself up on it every night""

My heart sank. I reached out for some help and thankfully one of my sup's took over on that one for me a few minutes later but I felt bad. I knew that guy was not going to get someone there any quicker than the two weeks I saw before. I had talked to many people before that had safety requests filled out and got nothing. 

And that killed me. I knew from the start I was not meant for customer service but I couldn't handle seeing that happen to someone again. That night I handed in my two weeks.

The Gov’t doesn’t care,"Quick backstory so it makes sense: if you’ve ever dealt with federal insurance, there’s lots of paperwork involved, including a fancy form known as an ABN if they decide they’re not gonna pay. Basically three options 1: you still want them billed first and you can appeal their decision, 2: you’d rather just pay outright, 3: you don’t want the supplies. 
Personally I think #3 is stupid because they can just verbally say they don’t want it. 

So my liaison calls me up because a mom is calling him, saying our call center won’t let her refill. Her kid has Medicare, and I can promise you that kid is really sick if he has Medicare. 
About mid-September our renewal department called and sent her a new ABN to sign because it has to be renewed once per year. 
Mom actually selected option 3. In my 10 years of service I have *never* seen someone pick option 3. Not even accidentally. 
Our team spent from September to early October trying to reach this lady to say “ma’am are you sure??” And she never answered or called us back. 

Today she calls for a refill and all hell breaks loose. I didn’t mean to pick that option! I need my supplies. 
I’m sorry ma’am but the federal government doesn’t care what you meant to do. I wouldn’t say that but it’s the honest truth. 

Because she didn’t pay attention or answer her phone, we have already discharged the kid’s account, set up to get our feeding pump back, and now, to get services again, she’s gonna start allllll over like she never was on service with us. 

Well, I hope she learned she should read contractual documents from this.",52,0,0,"The Gov’t doesn’t care Quick backstory so it makes sense: if you’ve ever dealt with federal insurance, there’s lots of paperwork involved, including a fancy form known as an ABN if they decide they’re not gonna pay.

FDM: (I lost it at this point) I’m sorry that’s not part of my job description. I am here to help and service paying customers not to keep track of our employees. We are having a very busy weekend so do not call us if you’re going to waste our time.

DT: I’m sorry. 

Honestly, I’m already really tired from showing guests around and I still have to deal with this shit. And no wonder customer service is a demanding industry.

At least, I get to see happy customers which makes me happy, and that’s what keeps me going day by day.

Fuck you, debt collectors who waste call centre employees time.

Uh excuse me? WAT?,"Obligatory  this just happened. 

So I got off a call with an unauthorized third party leasing agent wanting to know where her payoff she ordered October 29th went. 

I advised her that to get her payoff she would need to send in borrowers authorization and that is how our system works. She got angry with me and I told her again it is our system. We do not provide borrowers privatw information out to random people.  

Her response?

""Uhm excuse me can you transfer me to someone who actually knows how to do their job please""

"""can you not get a supervisor manager to override your security?!""","First real post here honestly so I'm kinda scared 😂

So earlier on today I had a call from a customer who seemed absolutely lovely, we had a great chat while I was helping with his query - until I had to take a payment.

Now this call should have taken all of 15-20 minutes (it's an insurance claim so kinda long) but it was almost an hour and 40 minutes and I ended up 50 minutes late on my break... Everything went fine bar the usual systems taking ages. When it came to the payment our payment system is really secure to the point we can't take a payment unless the card that's being used is registered to the address we have... Which this card wasn't (this guy stated it was the banks fault and kept reiterating that it was in no way my fault while having a go at me about our security system)

He acknowledged that I wasn't in the position to override this, so naturally he asked if we could override. I told him politely that it wasn't possible and it's the way the system we have is made to prevent fraudulent payments. He kept going on and on about it...

He then said it was a silly security question and asked for a manager to override it... At which point I bluntly said ""the only way we can override it is if we reprogram the whole system, so no"". And yet he just carried on. It was a real pain honestly... But he gave up eventually and said we'll be losing a customer once he made the payment.

Kinda short but it was hilarious at the time. I joked to one of my colleagues saying that if they wanted to pay for us to bring in a software engineer then fine we can rewrite the entire system just for this one guys payment",554,0,0,"""can you not get a supervisor manager to override your security?!""

"""Why is my bill more? Nothing has changed.""","Sorry for any formatting issues, on phone, but just need to vent a little 

I work for an electricity provider, dealing with, quite obviously, calls and emails from customers, covering a wide variety of issues.

As one might guess from the title, a common query is higher bills. Now querying a high bill is fine. It's my job to help people figure out why it is higher. Sometimes it's simple, with things such estimates but sometimes it requires investigation.

I cannot people who will not help themselves. Me asking if anything at all has changed is to try and guide you towards those possible reasons. Outright denying a single thing has changed and it must be the metre helps no one.

Kids over here were out of school for an extra 3 month. TVs, consoles, chargers...they don't cost much to run, but if you have kids, likely these such appliances were on more this year and that will add up over time.

I apologise for the mini rant, I just wish people would use common sense and realistically look into their usage. I have worked here almost 3 years. I have yet to see a metre test find an actual faulty metre.

"I don't let a woman get 5 free hours of parking, so she calls the police.","So this a fresh one. Just happened about 30 minutes ago. A true Karen of Karens. I work for a parking company that manages a university's parking for them, said university also has a major medical center on site that we also manage parking for.

&gt;Her: ""So, I was supposed to get a validation, but they told me their system was down and I'm disabled so I couldn't walk all the way to the other building to get one. I was here for 5 hours and they didn't see me and can you just open the gate for me?""

So, first off, I smelled some immediate bullshit on the ""systems were down"" comment. The medical center's stamp validators run off of our system so if they were down, our system would be down too. The medical center also stocks a significant number of ""offline"" validations that are just stickers you can put on your ticket. 

&gt;Me: ""I'm sorry ma'am, but I can't waive parking rates so unfortunately you will have to pay the balance shown on the screen to exit""

&gt;Her: ""Well I'm not paying, just let me out.""

Ahh, so that's her game.

&gt;Me: ""I can't do that ma'am, I'll send somebody over to assist you further.""

I hang up, and radio my field staff guy to head that way. I get about a minute of peace before the same woman calls back from the same help button, and I ignore it. Not going to talk to somebody who will be talking to somebody in person soon and who refused to pay. After about 3 minutes of having the call on waiting, it hangs up. I assume my field staff guy is there and I resume my usually nightly task of watching YouTube.

About 2 minutes later, I get a call from a # I recognize all too well. Its University PD Dispatch. Huh, wonder what's up. 

&gt;Me: ""Hello, Parking Company, how can I help you today?""

&gt;PD ""Hello, this is _____ With UniveristyPD Dispatch, we just got a call from a woman at GarageName, and were wondering if you had somebody on their way to assist them.""

&gt;PD: ""Okay, thank you. That's all we needed.""

&gt;Me: ""No problem, when did she call you?""

&gt;PD: ""About a minute ago.""

As she was saying that, my field staff guy called me on the radio.

&gt;Me: (To PD) "" Will do, goodbye."" (To Field) ""Yeah...I was just on the phone with PD Dispatch, they aren't sending anyone.""

&gt;Field: ""But she said she was going to wait for them? She's telling them we are keeping her here against her will.""

&gt;Me: ""Yeah, I'm not sure where she got the idea they were going to come out and let her out. Go ahead and fill out that Balance Due Form. Get her plate and mark it as leaving without payment and I'll raise the gate. We'll see what she does when the gate goes up.""

&gt;Field: ""Roger that.""

So I chill out for a couple of minutes while my field guy fills out the form with what we need. He gets it filled out and I raise the gate remotely, and she drives out and leaves to property. 

I get another call from PD right after I let her out. 

&gt;PD: ""Just calling to make sure, we were monitoring the situation and saw a vehicle just leave the center lane. Was that her?""

&gt;Me: ""Yup, that was her. Everything should be done with.""

&gt;PD: "" Sounds good, have a good night.""

Logical and simple, right?

Not to this customer. She was very upset that we would even CONSIDER cancelling her insurance for one missed payment. I tried explaining the above to her but she would not have it. In fact, she was so offended that she refused to make the payment, told me to just let the policy cancel, and she would take her business elsewhere since we were such a disrespectful company.

I got scammed. What are YOU gonna do about it?,"Ok so this happpened several weeks ago but I'm still kind of impressed by the audacity of this lady so I figured it would be entertaining enough to read.

Also I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting.

I work costumer service and reservations for a fairly big hotel company. Said company is big enough to have scammers calling around pretending to be us and offering vacation packages and whatnot to get people's information/money. Luckily, most people don't fall for this.

On the other side, the people who actually fall for these schemes can generally be divided in 2 groups; the angry ones and the enthusiastic ones.

The angry ones, as their name implies, call us to complain and demand we stop calling them. Their anger is understandable considering these people receive calls several times a day and sometimes very late at night (I've had people complain they've received calls at 3am). In these cases I can only apologize and explain it is not us calling but someone pretending to be us. I explain we are aware of the issue and are trying to shut them down but it's not something we can do from one day to the other, in the meantime I advice them to not give these people any kind of information, block the numbers they are receiving these calls from and even report them to the FTC, but that's pretty much everything I can do.

These calls, as unpleasant as they are, are not that hard to handle; Caller is angry, I apologize and explain the situation, they hang up either understanding or tell me to suck a dick before hanging up because that makes them feel better I guess. Only half joking here, that has happened a couple times.

The enthusiastic people though... Yeah those calls are a little bit tougher. These people are calling me all happy and excited and crushing their dreams, even if said dreams were based on lies, does feel a little bit bad.

Almost all of the enthusiastic people tell the scammers ""Oh thanks for the offer I will call you guys later"", then they find our reservations number online and call us only for one of our agents to tell them the truth. They're sad, we're sorry, the call ends.

But once in a blue moon, and by this I mean I've only heard of this happening once in like a year and a half from anyone in my center, the scammers get what they want.

Now, onto the story.

At about 5pm I got a call and I answered as I always do.


Me: Good afternoon, thank you for calling [Hotel Company]. My name is WoodenHandMagician, How can I help you today?

Linda: Hey good afternoon, my name is Linda (Not her actual name. I don't remember her actual name) and I was calling regarding a vacation package I was offered.


At this point I started asking questions. Most of the times these calls are about scams but some of our hotels do offer vacation packages and the like so I just gotta be sure before saying anything.


Me: So this is a package you were offered because you stayed at one of our hotels or-

Linda: Nono, I received a call from you guys the other day, they say I was eligible for a one week vacation package in Las Vegas.

Me: Oh I see and these people said they worked with us?

Linda: Yeah it was a call from you guys, I already paid $100 for the package they told me to call you when I was ready to book.

Oh... fuck.

Me *trying to figure out how to say it*: Ah I understand. I'm very sorry ma'am but... But that was not us.

Linda: What do you mean?

Me: Unfortunately we have people going around claiming to work with us and asking for people's information and card details. We have been trying to shut them down but we've had no success so far. We don't call people unless they called first to ask for information. We only send emails and that's to people who sign up for them.
What you can do is get in touch with your bank an-

Linda: Wait what?

As you can imagine, she did not get a week kn Vegas.

Tl;dr: Lady got scammed and wants me to do something about it. She doesn't understand we can't do anything about it.

Just a quick word of advice for anyone who might need it: If someone calls you asking you for money, don't give them money without verifying they are saying the truth.",875,0,0,"I got scammed. What are YOU gonna do about it? Ok so this happpened several weeks ago but I'm still kind of impressed by the audacity of this lady so I figured it would be entertaining enough to read.

Also I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting.

I work costumer service and reservations for a fairly big hotel company. Said company is big enough to have scammers calling around pretending to be us and offering vacation packages and whatnot to get people's information/money. Luckily, most people don't fall for this.

On the other side, the people who actually fall for these schemes can generally be divided in 2 groups; the angry ones and the enthusiastic ones.

The angry ones, as their name implies, call us to complain and demand we stop calling them. Their anger is understandable considering these people receive calls several times a day and sometimes very late at night (I've had people complain they've received calls at 3am). In these cases I can only apologize and explain it is not us calling but someone pretending to be us. I explain we are aware of the issue and are trying to shut them down but it's not something we can do from one day to the other, in the meantime I advice them to not give these people any kind of information, block the numbers they are receiving these calls from and even report them to the FTC, but that's pretty much everything I can do.

These calls, as unpleasant as they are, are not that hard to handle; Caller is angry, I apologize and explain the situation, they hang up either understanding or tell me to suck a dick before hanging up because that makes them feel better I guess. Only half joking here, that has happened a couple times.

The enthusiastic people though... Yeah those calls are a little bit tougher. These people are calling me all happy and excited and crushing their dreams, even if said dreams were based on lies, does feel a little bit bad.

Almost all of the enthusiastic people tell the scammers ""Oh thanks for the offer I will call you guys later"", then they find our reservations number online and call us only for one of our agents to tell them the truth. They're sad, we're sorry, the call ends.

But once in a blue moon, and by this I mean I've only heard of this happening once in like a year and a half from anyone in my center, the scammers get what they want.

Now, onto the story.

At about 5pm I got a call and I answered as I always do.


Me: Good afternoon, thank you for calling [Hotel Company]. My name is WoodenHandMagician, How can I help you today?

Linda: Hey good afternoon, my name is Linda (Not her actual name. I don't remember her actual name) and I was calling regarding a vacation package I was offered.


At this point I started asking questions. Most of the times these calls are about scams but some of our hotels do offer vacation packages and the like so I just gotta be sure before saying anything.


Me: So this is a package you were offered because you stayed at one of our hotels or-

Linda: Nono, I received a call from you guys the other day, they say I was eligible for a one week vacation package in Las Vegas.

Me: Oh I see and these people said they worked with us?

Linda: Yeah it was a call from you guys, I already paid $100 for the package they told me to call you when I was ready to book.

Oh... fuck.

Me *trying to figure out how to say it*: Ah I understand. I'm very sorry ma'am but... But that was not us.

Linda: What do you mean?

Me: Unfortunately we have people going around claiming to work with us and asking for people's information and card details. We have been trying to shut them down but we've had no success so far. We don't call people unless they called first to ask for information. We only send emails and that's to people who sign up for them.
What you can do is get in touch with your bank an-

Linda: Wait what?

Me: As I said ma'am, those people did not work for us. I'm very sorry to say this but you got scammed. Like I was telling you you shou-

Linda: And what are you gonna do about it?

*Insert white guy blinking meme*

Me: Sorry?

Linda: Yes. What are you gonna do for me?

Me: Well... There's nothing we can do at this point I'm sorry. We can't reverse a payment because you didn't pay us anything and we can't give you a room because you have not paid us anything.

The Call that Did Me In,"It's a normal day in the cu-bi-cle, a normal day for a guest call. Would you be mine? Could you be mine?

Call starts off and a gruff voice tells me he wants to book a room at our El Dorado resort. Guy is no nonsense and his speech is short and to the point. Sounds very military. Despite his lack of small talk, I eventually get him to share that he is indeed a veteran and that he and his old army buddy have a tradition every year of booking a room at our El Dorado resort and tying one on like the old days.

I thank him for his service, tout the newly renovated bar lounge, as well as a few other places around campus that my brother recommends (he's a bartender and I don't drink so I rely on him) and tell him I'm pleased to report we do in fact have a room for his dates. The call, so far, is easy peasy lemon squeezy.

Then he said it.

Grizzled Army Vet: ""And that's not a king bed, right?""

Me: ""Yes sir, that is correct. The standard room comes with two queen beds.""

Grizzled Army Vet: ""Okay, good. We're not in the navy, ya know.""

Time of Death: 3:02 pm.

I was done. Fell right out of my chair to the floor, laughing at the top of my lungs, pounding the cubicle wall. I don't know why that hit me so hard. Maybe it was the mock serious voice, the smile I could hear over the phone as he landed his joke, or just my own family history of army vs navy jokes, but I was absolutely useless for the next few minutes. Everyone within a few rows was popping up to figure out why I was suddenly interrupting their calls with laughter and my leader had to ask if I was okay.

My new favorite guest gave a chuckle and said he appreciated a man with a ""sophisticated sense of humor"" lol. I hated that our call only lasted another few minutes past that, as he turned out to be a really awesome guy. I wished him a great trip with his buddy and sent word to the resort to give him a little something extra for their stay as thanks for brightening my day.

"No, I don't want you checking if I might be alone in my flat dying from COVID","Hi there!
This is my first ever post on reddit and English is not my native language so please be gentle with me. Also, I hope this is the right place for this tale.

I work in the health department and among other things I am responsible for calling people that are currently quarantined for COVID asking about their general health. If they are not feeling well I refer them to a on-call doctor, or, in really urgent cases, call an ambulance for them. This is to make sure nobody gets left alone and unnoticed with their symptoms getting worse while they are not allowed to leave the house to see a doctor.

We are currently extremely busy as the cases go up rapidly, so we have to prioritize who we call. As you can imagine, we mostly call elderly persons or persons that already have conditions making a bad COVID disease likely.

Yesterday I called a young, otherwise perfectly healthy woman. We had a kind of dead point which was unexpected so I had time to call her. Her previous symptoms of COVID where pretty light but better check right? M: me, P: patient

Being the last business day of October, I sent out the bills (they’re called levy notices and are due quarterly) that are due on 1 December 2020.

I receive a reply from a customer who receives his levy notices via email, asking why I no longer sending out levy notices in advance. Complaining he only just received his levy notice that’s due on 1 December 2020, and it’s already overdue. Except...what? 

It was a lot more detailed than that, asking the same question in a whole variety of ways. Such, as “when did you stop sending the levy notices in advance?”. And “if you’re going to send my levy notices after the due date, do I have to remember to pay them earlier?”. 

I did respond in the best way I could manage, without asking him if he’s living in the future, and if so, what’s it like and did Trump or Biden win the US election?",833,0,0,"Don’t you send bills before their due anymore?

But you offered it!,"One of the most annoying team leaders I ever had honestly believed EVERY guest could be helped, no matter how impossible their request. She was wrong.

It was a normal day, and then my phone beeped.

Me: ""Thank you for calling \[Popular Theme Park\] Travel Company, my name is Walter (fake stage name), how can I help you today?""

Guest: ""Yes, I'm looking to make a reservation at your ""Pine Tree Lodge resort"". I'd like the room you're advertising with two king beds.""

Me: ""You mean two queen beds....""

Guest: ""No, two kings. I'm reading it on the website.""

Me: ""Sir, the rooms in that resort have two queen beds, or a queen and a set of bunk beds. I can request a single king bed, is that what you mean?""

""No, you aren't listening to me. I can read, okay? It says two king beds. I want two king beds.""

Me: ""Okay Sir, one moment. Let me look at what you're looking at.""

So I pulled up the website and looked at the resort. Whelp....somebody dun goofed. The website said that our Pine Tree Lodge resort had two king beds in their rooms. And as the guest bible says, ""thus, if the website spaketh it, it musteth be trueth.""

 Me: ""Sir, I am really sorry about this, but that is a typo. The room has two queen beds, not two kings.""

Guest: ""That's not a typo, that's a f\*cking lie! You put it, you have to honor it. Now get me the room I want!""

Me: ""I can't sir, it doesn't exist.""

Guest: ""Well the website says it does. So what's the problem?""

Me, getting frustrated: ""The problem is, we don't have rooms with two kings. They simply don't exist. There's no way for us to do that for you. We can't give you what we don't have.""

For those of you thinking, ""why not just tell him all the rooms were filled,"" yes, that would have been smarter, and hindsight is 20/20. When I get focused on something, I sometimes can't get past that particular thought.

We went back and forth for over fifteen minutes. No matter how I phrased ""Does. Not. Exist."" He didn't get it, or just didn't care. I offered better rooms, discounts, options. Nada. Finally I started losing my cheery disposition.

Guest: ""So you're telling me you won't get me the room you're advertising?""

Me: ""No sir. I'm telling you I CAN'T get you that room, I can't even get ME that room.""

Guest: ""Are you getting an attitude with me?""

My brain: \*No, but that dam's about to burst\*

Me: ""Sir, what do you want me to do, here?""

Guest: ""I want you to get me the room I want, that YOU offered.""

Me: ""All right, Sir. It will be available in 2014."" (This was 2010)

That's not how this works.,"So earlier today, I was in the last 30 minutes before clocking out for the day. I picked up the call and it seemed to be an older gentleman that just radiated entitlement over the phone. The EntitledBastard (EB) gave me his name and said he wanted to suspend his paper delivery. I said I could get that set through but I would need his address for verification. He gave me that I went to the suspension screen in his account and asked him what dates.

EB: ""I told you I wanted to stop the paper tomorrow and resume on Friday, November 13th.""

Me: ""Alright, I can get that set through, but the first date of the suspension will have to be in 2 business days. I can start that on Monday, November 2nd.""

EB: ""Fine. Very well. Now I want you to remain on the line until I receive the email confirmation.""

Me: ""Sir, the email is automated and could take up an hour to come through.""

Now the conversation just kind of went back and for of me asking him if there was anything I could do to help him, him saying I didn't do anything to help him. Him comparing my service to bring him a hamburger when he ordered a steak. Him informing me that he was the customer and I have to listen to him, and my CSR skills were horrible and he had no idea why I hadn't been fired yet. And just so much BS for so long, so indirectly pitched to him ""If there is nothing else I can do to help you, would you like to speak to someone else."" and thankfully he took that and requested the supervisor. I told sup what was up and finally ended my conference with this entitled basted. The sup messaged me later and was kinda like ""Wtf was he on. He tried belittling me too.""

"""Felt cute. Might call in to fight a tech support rep for no reason, idk""","Guy calls in all pissed and ranting because one of his customers got a ""page not secure"" error when viewing his website.

I basically find the problem while he's bitching - there's a broken picture on his main page, and all he has to do is log in and delete it. I wait for him to quiet before I try explaining what he needs to do to fix it.

Nope. He still wants to battle me, demanding why it happened, saying it happened two years ago and demanding to know why it happened *then.*

Try to explain that I can't speak to what happened two years ago because I wasn't actually working at the company then. Dude keeps cutting me off, so I start cutting him off. Then he starts lecturing me not to talk when he's talking.

He keeps demanding to know why  it happened. I straight up tell him I have found the problem and I am trying to show him where to fix it. We get halfway to where he needs to be before he flips out again and keeps saying he doesn't *care* about XYZ, he just wants it fixed.

Explain that he *has* to go to his site settings to delete the image causing his site to get flagged as not secure. It would have taken him five clicks, max. He cuts me off halfway into *that* explanation saying he doesn't *caaaare* about his site settings or any images, he just wants it fixed.

So he's clearly one of these types, to which I usually just go the route of fixing it myself and then being like, ""there it's fixed"". But, we're trained to not make any changes to our clients' websites or settings without their go-ahead. So I try to talk him through what I PERSONALLY WILL DO to fix the issue.

Still. Not. Enough. Bastard STILL cuts me off in the middle saying he *doesn't caaaare* and continues to bitch about his customer and his web presence.

It's a few minutes after we're to leave for the day. I am tired, and I am very hungry, and both of those factors combined isn't really doing much to quell my growing anxiety. I'm sitting there speechless for several minutes unsure how to proceed.

Finally, HE ends the call saying that he and I don't see eye to eye, asked for my name, and that if he ever called tech support again, he'd make sure not to get me. HE is the one who said ""we're getting nowhere"" after he spent the past 15-20 minutes ***ACTIVELY REFUSING TO LET ME FIX THE PROBLEM****.* I just told him I'd look into it.

Ended up DMing my manager and letting him know the whole exchange. Manager gave me the go-ahead to just delete the picture and let him know the problem was fixed since the guy was being that difficult about it. I sent him a sickly sweet, obnoxiously happy-go-lucky email telling him this, signed with a closer I *never* use:

""I hope you have an absolutely wonderful rest of your evening!!""

"Work On A Computer That's Well Out Of Warranty? Thanks, But No.","Someone jogged my memory about call I’d blocked out. 

I did remote tech support for a company that contracted out to a major cable company and office supply stores. I got a call from Delusional Customer. 

DC: Hi. You guys did some work on two computers for me and one of them isn’t working. 

OP: Ok. Do you have the receipt or your name so I can look it up?

DC: My name is Delusional Customer. 

OP: Thanks. Give me a minute. 

I look up the name and find that, yes, we did work on two laptops for him……….two years ago. 

OP: Hey, thanks for waiting. Yes, I found the order and, yes, we did the work. Unfortunately, the work was done two years ago and it’s out of warranty. 

DC: Out of warranty? How can it be out of warranty?

OP: Well, it’s been two years so….

DC: No. You don’t understand. I just turned it on for the first time today. 

OP: Um. So you had two laptops worked on and you only turned one of them on?

DC: Yes. Correct. So now you have to fix the one that’s not working. 

OP: I’m…pretty sure we can’t do that. Again, the work was done two years ago. 

DC: I get that. But, obviously, you didn’t fix one of them because it’s not working. Look. I was using the other one up until yesterday and it died. So I went to go use this one and it’s not working. So you need to fix it.

OP: Okay. So what you’re saying is that you got it fixed two years ago but you never bothered to check whether it was actually fixed.

DC: \[Smugly\] Yes. So fix it. 

While this is going on, I’m IM’ing with my supervisor who’s cracking up. Under no circumstances can I do anything on this Delusional Customer’s dead machine. He’s not going to give up and continues to make his case which continually gets shot down.

DC: So…you’re fixing it. 

OP: Look. Can I give you an example of what I’m hearing?

DC: Sure.

OP: So, you run a garage. Someone brings in two cars to get repaired. One is the primary car and the other they just leave in the driveway for two years. After two years, the primary car dies. They go to the back up car they’ve left in the driveway for two years and it doesn’t work. So you’re saying that when the tow truck drops off the dead car at your garage, that you’ll gladly repair a car that was never driven for two years?

DC: (after a fun, awkward pause) Well……….yeah. I would. Sure. Yeah.

OP: With all due respect, I don’t believe you. There is literally no way you could verify what’s actually happened in the past two years with that car.

DC: Look. I’d…want to take pride in my work and make the customer happy.

OP: So do I. But I’d be a horrible businessman if just let people void the warranty. 

DC: Well, come on, the warranty should start from the time you start using it. 

OP: Um. No. If you’d turned it on two years ago and it didn’t work, certainly we’d fix it. But not now. Sorry.

Here are some funny things guests have said on the phone...
 
1. Caller from Michigan: ""We'd like to go up to your hotel in Toronto. Is there anything to do in that town? Are we going to be bored?""
 
2. ""If I'm lying down on the beach at the hotel, am I facing the beach? Or am I facing the hotel?""
 
3. While describing the private check-in included with the premium rooms, the guest says: ""HAHA! I get a private chicken with that?""
 
4. ""I would like to hold that room with my federal express card.""
 
5. Question from a guest to an agent: ""Are you on a cell phone?""
 
6. Guest asks for the AAA rate. Agent replies: ""Yes, we do have the ""Triple A"" rate available for 149.00."" Guest replies: ""Okay, so you called that the ""Chip-away"" rate?""
 
7. Comment from guest: ""I'd like to reconfirm my reservations for tomorrow at the (names a hotel in Quebec) in Calgary please.""
 
8. ""If I check in at 6:00 p.m. can I have the room at half price?""
 
9. ""What is your symbol for money in Canada? Here in the US, it's a letter ""S"" with a line down the middle.""
 
10. ""My friend brought me this very tiny bottle of shampoo from one of your hotels. Your phone number is on it. It doesn't give any directions as to how to use it! How many times to apply to your hair? Can you help me?"""
No storm came through here,"It's hard to believe people exist who are so anti science and deny everything from Vaccines to Climate change but with callers like the ones I speak with today its very clear that they are real.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Warning, I am an electric company employee talking about the outages caused by a storm, I sympathize with those without power. Don't take my story as being heartless.\*

&amp;#x200B;

I am a Floridian but as my company is multistate, the incident I am talking about is the outages caused by Hurricane Zeta that is currently affecting the east coast further north of here. Unfortunately the storm has seen over 250,000 people without power and plenty of them are calling in with questions as to when their power will be back on.

As a personal bias, I've always thought our partner state's customers were much nicer about outages. Floridians lose power for a minute and lose it. However today's storm has us giving ETA's of restoration that so far are in the DAYS not hours like they normally are so that hospitality is really being tested.

Que the storm denier. I'm always prepared to speak to angry customers after a storm who yell about how we should be repairing faster or we should have done more to prepare. I wasn't quite ready for this guy who flat out refused to accept a storm went through the state. He was adamant that it was just a light breeze today and not even enough to shake a tree, so there is no way his power should be out. He refused to believe that there are over 250,000 people without power because I couldn't prove that to him so I must be lying. Worst of all, he drove around the block and saw power on several streets away so clearly that means nothing could be wrong that doesn't take more than a flip of a switch to fix. I've dealt with plenty of Floridians claim ""the storm wasn't that bad, it was only a category 3!"" but I just had no words for the argument that the storm didn't happen at all. It turned into the worst type of call, just having to raise my voice over the customer to tell them that yes a storm DID travel across the state. 

If you are in the affected areas of Zeta, I wish you well and if you have new information please do call and report it!

"How to handle a customer who keeps interrupting you, and won't let you get a word in edge wise.","This is going to sound crazy, but is a master level of conversational passive aggressiveness.

You all know the type, the customer that interrupts you at every turn, bulldozing over whatever explanation they've asked you to provide, or perhaps options you want to lay out to them to choose from. These people are their own worse enemies and its your job to save them from themselves, but they just wont let you talk.

The second you do get a moment to speak, begin as normal and tell that asshole ""ok so as i was saying....hey, you know what, I forgot what i was going to say.""

It forces the customer to realize they NEED you. Either to tell them the information they want to know or what options they have. It makes them realize they are being overpowering conversational assholes and every time I have told a customer this, they have apologized for interrupting and its much easier to speak with them after.

Wherein a caller tells me some fabulous stories,"Many moons ago, I worked at a reservations call center for an international chain.

One of my favorite calls came in around midnight ET on a Sunday night.

A very friendly older woman (I assumed she was older because her voice had that wavy sound) wanted to book a stay at our hotel on Cape Cod near Hyannis.

Once that was settled and she had written down the confirmation number (this was 1986), she began to tell me a long story about her late husband who had been best friends with [Sargent Shriver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargent_Shriver) (father of Maria) and how they used to pal around with all the Kennedy boys at the Hyannisport compound and how sad it was that Bobby had died so young and what a good president he would have been. She told me she knew Jackie and her sister, Lee Radziwill, and how she'd known Jackie when they'd attended Miss Porter's School in Connecticut, etc, etc.

At the time, I was but a young gayling, so the only name I recognized was Kennedy. I had no real idea where Cape Cod was or who any of the other people were but her stories were mesmerizing. None of it felt like namedropping. It just sounded like someone who was reminiscing.

I was on the line for about half an hour before the only floor supervisor (FS) on duty showed up and made a slashing motion across her throat with her finger as a sign for me to hang up. I told the woman that, I was sorry, but I had to take another call. She replied and said she hadn't thought about any of that for a very long time and mentioned how nice I'd been to listen.

After the call ended, I put myself on unavailable since the FS was still standing there. She told me she'd been monitoring the call from the beginning and that she'd waited for as long as she thought she could get away with before coming to tell me to disconnect. She then began to explain who all the people were (she was in her 40s, I think) and how the caller had obviously lived an amazing life. Or she was an amazing liar.

Either way, the stories were awesome. Since then, I've lived on Cape Cod and have been to some of the places the woman mentioned. Every now and then I'll read a story about someone and realize this was someone this marvelous woman (allegedly) knew.

True or not, this was a wonderful gift that I've always treasured.

Why I didn't pay my bill...,"I used to work in a collections center for one of the big credit card companies. I worked in the 1m late which was anything up to 30 days after they missed their first payment. 

I thought I might give you a few of the entertaining gems I still remember as to why people had failed to pay their bills.

1. My father died (the client had literally used this every time they were late for 4 years. He was late about every other month).
2. I forgot to pay my bill because of Jimmy Carter's presidency. (This was in the early 2000s)
3. It's all Clinton's fault!
4. My dog ate the credit card, so I didn't think I had to pay it anymore.
5. I was abducted by aliens 
6. Dave Ramsey said not to pay my credit cards (smh)
7. My sugar daddy quit
8. Credit Cards are a government conspiracy to enslave the people of the world.

For those wondering here are the saddest reasons I was given.

1. I had more refunds than my minimum payment, so I didn't think I had to make a payment. I had to explain that refunds didn't count towards the payments.
2. I decided to say I declare bankruptcy, so I don't have to pay bills now.   
\~\~After asking for their lawyer's info I found out that they didn't have a lawyer, and hadn't filed it through court, they just said ""I declare bankruptcy"" and thought that was all they had to do. Sadly I had to explain to them that's not how bankruptcy works. 
3. The person who literally lost their entire family in a car accident and only survived because they had to work and couldn't leave with the rest of the family for the vacation. They had planned on driving up the next day.",63,0,0,"Why I didn't pay my bill... I used to work in a collections center for one of the big credit card companies.

Confessing to fraud,"This happened years ago, but I still think about it sometimes. I worked in a third party verification call center for an internet provider and had to call customers to clarify information on their internet services orders. One time I called this lady and asked to speak with the person on the order, who she stated was her husband. She said she could verify everything because he wasn’t home. I told her I had to speak with the person whose name was on the order. We went back and forth with me explaining policy and her saying it was stupid. Then she lost her temper and said “well my husband is dead so you can’t speak to him!”

The Day I Freaked Out my new Team Leader.,"The Theme Park Travel Company I worked for had hundreds of agents, all split into teams, each with a team leader. Because your team leader could change every time your schedule did, you wound up being on several teams as your schedule needs change, so every six months it was ""first day of school"" again as your new team got to know each other and the new leader (presuming you haven't had them before).

Most of the leaders were great and each had their own style of management and learning. One leader (we'll call her Martha, and I'll stick to my fake stage name Walter) was an absolute sweetheart, and had a tradition with new teams of testing their ""powers of observation"" as she put it, because that was very important on the phones.

So, she sat in a chair in front of us in the meeting room and gave us a few minutes in silence to make notes about what we observe.

I was sitting towards the front on the right side of the room. By luck, she chose the left side of the room to start. Everyone said the usual things. ""You're Caucasian. You've got blonde/formerly blonde hair, you dress professionally, you're wearing XYZ, you have brown eyes, you have a nice smile"" etc. As more people spoke, it was repeats or ""what they said.""

Then it came to my turn. Now, I'm a fairly observant person, even though I tend to look like I'm lost in my own head. Plus, I was told to focus on her and write down \*all\* my observations about her. Okie dokie. I figured I'd see how many good guesses I could make and started picking at details I noticed. Buckle up, kids.

Martha: ""Walter, have you got anything else?""

Me: \*Takes a deep breath\* You were born and raised in the midwest, I'm guessing Missouri, and you lived there until after college, at which point you moved to Florida. Your father was in the armed forces. You were raised Catholic and went to Catholic school until at least through 8th grade. You're divorced but on good terms with your ex. You have a daughter and a grandson. You're trying to quit biting your nails and you've been on a diet for a few weeks. Oh, and all the stuff they said.""

\*Crickets\*

Various Team members: What? How? WHAT?

Martha: That was...impressively detailed.

Team member: Wait, he's RIGHT?

Martha: Well I lived in Missouri until I was thirty, and I was in Catholic School through tenth grade. \*looks at me\* How did you do that?

I explained about her posture, the way she sat with her ankles crossed and hands in her lap, her trace of an accent showing she'd grown up to develop an accent, but moved away long enough for it to dilute and pick up Florida expressions, the wedding ring she wore around her neck on a small chain, the way her clothes were slightly loose showing she'd lost some weight, her fingernails were self evident, and I saw the photo of her daughter and grandson on her desk. Her bearing and speech indicated a certain upbringing and given her age and such I guessed army dad, etc.

I may have had more details in there, but this was a decade ago so my memory might have forgotten a detail or two.

Martha and I got along great, and I learned a lot from her, but she always was very careful what she said near me in case I started using my psychic powers again. :D

When Between-Call Reading Tries to Come to Life,"I work in an insurance call center handling complex technical calls and taking escalated calls. Most of my calls are ho-hum technical calls. I handle escalations about billing and underwriting, which are usually a variation of ""how dare you tell me that you won't insure me for free."" The call I'm about to describe is probably one of the most memorable deviations from the norm I've ever had. 

Picture it: My junk room-turned-office space in these times of COVID with your intrepid writer waiting for a call. In one hand is my third can of Diet Coke for the night. In the other hand is a copy of a Stephen King novel. Not just any Stephen King novel, but Dreamcatcher. The headset beeps and the call comes through from one of the new reps on the phone in sales.

Newbie tells me customer wants to reinstate his policy. One that's been cancelled for eight months, mind you. She's told him no, you need to rewrite. He doesn't want to rewrite because he doesn't like the quote. He wants a manager to override this and reinstate the cancelled policy. I'm salty because I was getting to a good part of the book and there's no way in hell I can do what he's asking. So I have her send him on through.

He comes on the line and we review the policy together. He actually doesn't owe money on this cancelled policy, but it cancelled because he didn't complete basic follow up for verification purposes. Since our underwriting department requested the follow up and it never got completed, they cancelled the policy. If your policy is going to be cancelled for any reason, your insurance company is legally required to send you notification via USPS to give you sufficient notice. We can also email it if you've selected the Online Documents option, as customer had. We had sent at least two notices about the cancellation, as well as around five or six reminders for follow up, only to get radio silence in response.

I explain to him that we've sent notices via email and USPS. He tells me in the most matter-of-fact tone possible that he won't check the mail or emails we send because the aliens are clearly tracking him this way. Without missing a beat, he proceeds to tell me that he was abducted by aliens shortly after he started this auto policy. Buddy here not only managed to involve extra-terrestrials, but apparently chemtrails are really what you see when their spaceships enter the atmosphere from the home planet. And for those of you who are curious, it only took him twenty-five seconds to then mention that anal probing is a thing, but is actually gentler than you'd think, what with all the vibrating.

Keeping a straight face while telling him that alien abduction wasn't a valid reason for reinstating a policy was difficult, but not the hardest part. I had to mute the phone when he told me that he objected to the new quote because the premium for the term was $666. This allegedly would allow the aliens to start tracking him again. But he also didn't want to change anything about the quote or the payment method.

Gotta love the ones who think they know more than you.,"I work for a popular roadside assistance call center in this is one of the more interesting calls I got today.

C:  Yes so I was billed by your company and would like a refund. I used my online bill pay through my bank to pay you guys.

M:  Oh okay I'd be happy to help.

* Goes through basic verification and pulls up membership*

M:  Well ma'am I don't see that we received the payment you sent. You said you sent it through online bill pay?

C:  Yes.

M:  Online bill pay as in the bank either sends out a check or electronic payment on your behalf right?

C: yup.

M:  Okay well since we have not received the payment the check the bank sent may have gotten lost in the mail. If you contact the bank they should be able to stop payment and reverse the funds back to your account.

C: No. It was sent electronically by the bank. 

M:  Did you verify with the bank that it was sent electronically?

C: No. But I know it was. 

M:  We don't have an account and routing number to receive funds electronically. The only way online bill pay could work is by the bank sending a check. 

C:  No. It was definitely sent electronically using your an account and routing number.

M: *annoyed* Ma'am what's the account and routing number you gave the bank to send the funds electronically to us?

C:  I don't remember but I have the account and routing number for my checking account. Do you want it?

M: Ma'am I don't need that.  I used to work for a financial institution and dealt with online bill pay. Since we don't have an account and routing number to receive payments we could not possibly have received your funds electronically which means it was most likely sent by check on behalf of the bank.  Now we can open a research case  but that takes about 48 business hours so I the highly recommend you contact your bank and they should be able to stop the check and reverse the funds much quicker.

C: NO!  I'm not contacting my bank because they won't be able to do anything!  These funds were not sent by check. They were sent electronically.

M: ..........Ma'am we will go ahead and open a research case and follow up with you in about 48 business hours....

C: Okay thank you *click*

C:  Yes so I was billed by your company and would like a refund. I used my online bill pay through my bank to pay you guys.

M:  Oh okay I'd be happy to help.

* Goes through basic verification and pulls up membership*

M:  Well ma'am I don't see that we received the payment you sent. You said you sent it through online bill pay?

C:  Yes.

M:  Online bill pay as in the bank either sends out a check or electronic payment on your behalf right?

C: yup.

M:  Okay well since we have not received the payment the check the bank sent may have gotten lost in the mail. If you contact the bank they should be able to stop payment and reverse the funds back to your account.

C: No. It was sent electronically by the bank. 

M:  Did you verify with the bank that it was sent electronically?

C: No. But I know it was. 

M:  We don't have an account and routing number to receive funds electronically. The only way online bill pay could work is by the bank sending a check. 

C:  No. It was definitely sent electronically using your an account and routing number.

The charger you sold me burned my $2.000 computer,"So, this is actually something common to happen, but still is ridiculous lol.

I work in the rainforest retailer, and at least 2 or 3 times per week all of the CSA's get a contact with the charger of a MacBook that... Is not original basically. 

Almost everytime the complain is that it's not working anymore, that it got too hot, that it sparkled, nothing too serious, and we educate the customers not to buy them.

Once in a while, we have the mighty and fearsome Karen, who is the unlucky one that purchased that charger but this time is her laptop the one who got damaged for the voltage difference. By the terms and conditions, we will be able to send a replacement if available, or refund the money, but we won't be responsible for damages caused for the charger in this case.

Obviously, this Karen is not to blame for purchasing a $20 chinese charger instead of the $70-$50 original one, but us for selling her ""this piece of crap"" (by the way, those are sold by third party sellers).

Everytime I tell them basically ""Apple encourages to use original chargers for their devices, and they won't cover any warranty for not following those recommendations, and is the same on us.""

On me, I cannot understand why would you purchase a $2.000 computer and later purchase the cheaper charger on the market, no matter if it's Apple, Dell or anything.

No one went and dug up your old claim,"I work in medical claims at a call center. Elsewhere (different state), there are people that scan in the claims that are mailed. I deal with providers at facilities, not the actual patient on the claim. 

The provider was calling about a corrected claim and gave me the date it was received. I found it scanned in a few days later, so I knew the claim matched. 

However, the error had not been corrected on the claim. It was the exact same as the original that was denied. 

She insisted it was impossible. She told me I was looking at the wrong claim. I told her I had both claims, gave her both scan dates and both claim numbers.

"I don't like the truth, so I'm not gonna give you the information you need to assist me! That will show you!","You guys! I started my first job in a call center yesterday, so i can finally post here!

So, i started to take calls for my countries new (6 month old) Hotline for traveling *INTO* my country with respect to the new corona rules. Not for traveling from my country to another country. Not how to get a visa. Not where you can get a test in the country you're trying to travel from. Not weather you have to wear a mask on the plane. 

Only. For. Traveling. Into. My. Country.

It's a mess, as you can imagine, because rules change daily, sometimes by the hour, the rules are new and confusing, people make up stupid rumors, you know it.

Most people are fine, if not confused, desperate or the connection is garbage. But here comes my first major c***-caller.

Me: me
C: caller /c***
S: supervisor


Me: Hello *Hotline name * how may i help you?

C: I have people coming from several different countries TODAY to participate in a photo shoot. I'm unsure how the rules are for entering the country? Do they need a corona test? 

Me: Thanks for the question. *Explanation:* Weather and how people can enter depends on their citizenship, the country they travel from, and their reason for the visit. 
If your employees /partners have paid work to do in this country, they have a valid reason, but weather they need a recent, valid Corona-test to cross the border depends on the country they travel from. [There are about six countries left in the world that don't require a test, and they are falling like dominoes] 
So, are they foreigners and where do they travel to this country from?

C: They are all foreigners, *lists a few countries where they come from*

Me: A few of these countries will require them to have taken a Covid-test to enter, even if they fulfill the requirement for a valid reason. 

C: But they can't get a test with such short notice! It takes weeks to book a test! They fly in today! I called you a few days ago and asked your colleague, they said they didn't need the test??? 

Me: That's weird. These are basic rules, every one of my colleagues would have told you they need a test. 
When did you call and who did you talk to? 

C: I can't remember who i talked to or when i called. 

Me: Alright, the only solution i can offer you is for your employees to fill out this form that says you promise to take a test immediately and then self-quarantine for 48 hours. 

C: No good! They can't self-quarantine, the photo-shoot is today! 

Me: Then they can't come in. They incriminate themselves if they don't follow the agreement they signed. Now, i think one of the countries you named doesn't require a test, but some of them definitely do. Can you repeat the countries so i can tell you which people can enter? 

C: No, they all need to enter today, there must be a solution! The coworker [who she can't remember] that i talked with a few days ago [she can't remember when] told me they could enter! 

Me: I apologize if we gave you wrong or unclear information, but the rules can not be bent. They need to stay out or quarantine for 48 hours. I'm sorry. One person on your list might be able to enter though, might i get the countries again? 

C: No! There has to be a solution here! I want to talk to someone else! 

Me: I will ask my supervisor. 

*walks over to supervisor*

S: [immediately] Is she muted? 

Me:*mutes her*

S: I'm not gonna talk to her. You need to make clear to her what the rules are. 

Me to c: *explains everything again*

C: *says the same as before*

Me: I really want to help you here. Some of your models might me able to enter without a test. May i have the countries again? 

And now, get this, SHE decides that she is fed up with ME. So she gets snappy in her tone and interrupts me:

C: Maybe you should have written them down, then you wouldn't have to ask all the time!?

Me: You told me the countries once. I don't need the countries. You need the information. I'm trying to help you. 

C: Maybe i don't want to talk to someone who screams at me?????? [i didn't] I want to talk to someone else! 

Finally, my supervisor has mercy with me and takes the phone. Talks extremely calmly for about a minute. Then the call ends.

"We did what she wanted, and we’re still wrong?","Part of my job involves taking escalated calls, so this woman had been on the line with the agent for about 35 minutes and was either not listening or not willing to understand the situation. 

Basically a few years ago she had given us authority to direct debit her bank account for her son’s membership. She’s now calling us to see why a payment she wasn’t expecting came out of her account. The agent explained it to her, but because her son has a separate membership we can only give limited info, only info relating to the payments (because it’s her account, right?) 

Anyway, she comes through to me and I explain what the agent had already explained to her, and the following occurred. 

Customer: but how can you just take my money without telling me? 

Me: I appreciate that it was a few years ago but you did give us authority to do so. We don’t make any changes unless they’re requested, so as you never told us you wanted the payments to stop they’re still going 

C: but I didn’t even get a reminder that it was going to happen 

M: we send a reminder before the yearly payment is due, but it would have been sent to your son as he’s the policy holder and it’s his contact details on file

C: well he moves around a lot so he probably didn’t receive it 

M: okay but it’s his responsibility to tell us if he moves. Besides it was probably sent via email 

C (now getting very aggressive): this is just disgusting that (company) is doing this to me, I’ve been a member for so long and you’re basically stealing my money 

M (also getting frustrated): no, we’re not stealing anything. We’re following your instructions to debit your account. Like I said it was a few years ago that you set this up, but the payments have come out every year at the same time and this is the first time you’ve contacted us about it 

C: there’s no need to raise your voice at me. I’m a loyal member and I think you should reimburse me for these payments 

M: there’s no need for you to raise your voice at me either. And perhaps you can talk to your son about reimbursing you, as it’s his policy that you’re paying for 

She went on to say that she’s going to tell her son to cancel his policy and that she’ll get the money back. I told her he’s more than welcome to call us to cancel and we will happily refund anything that is paid past the cancellation date. 

I removed her bank details from her sons policy and emailed him to let him know he needs to update his payment method.

I fully expect her to make a complaint about me, but I really couldn’t care less.

Abuse,"I’m going to need people to stop being verbally abusive. 

Holding for a half an hour really doesn’t warrant yelling and calling people names. 

I really like my work place, it’s the only reason I stay. But people really need to have some human decency. It’s really quite sad that people feel the need to call an employee derogatory names because they stayed on hold for x amount of time.

Sigh I am unhelpful.,"So the other day I had this woman call in because she wanted to open an escrow account and it wasn't processing  fast enough for her. And somehow that became my problem.  So she calls in complaining  that she paid  5k into this escrow account was told it would be open in November and that she would get a call back that it was open. Easy enough . I tell her I can assist and she starts getting nasty. She's condescending and asking why she can't see it online if its open.  Why its not updating etc. Its a 45 minute call of me trying to assist. Telling her I cant figure it out.  I cant find a way to tell her her new payment since we have to wait for the system to update.  Etc. Blah blah blah.  Ok she gets mad at me and asks for a supervisor so I do the whole, I'll get one connected it will take some time shit. Ok. So I put her on hold go to my supervisors with my tail between my legs and they get upset and dont want to help surprise surprise... so I go back to tell her and she
Goes you are the most unhelpful customer service representative I have ever had the business of taking to. I want a refund right now. So I go back and tell my boss and my boss said she can do it  cool beans. I tell the customer and she gets pissed off even more.

And somehow that became my problem.  So she calls in complaining  that she paid  5k into this escrow account was told it would be open in November and that she would get a call back that it was open. Easy enough . I tell her I can assist and she starts getting nasty. She's condescending and asking why she can't see it online if its open.  Why its not updating etc. Its a 45 minute call of me trying to assist. Telling her I cant figure it out.  I cant find a way to tell her her new payment since we have to wait for the system to update.  Etc. Blah blah blah.  Ok she gets mad at me and asks for a supervisor so I do the whole, I'll get one connected it will take some time shit. Ok. So I put her on hold go to my supervisors with my tail between my legs and they get upset and dont want to help surprise surprise... so I go back to tell her and she
Goes you are the most unhelpful customer service representative I have ever had the business of taking to. I want a refund right now. So I go back and tell my boss and my boss said she can do it  cool beans. I tell the customer and she gets pissed off even more. I finally get her over and this lady starts telling my boss I'm unhelpful, and I'm curt, and im rude, and unsympathetic.   She's never met one like me and I'm horrible and I deserve to be fired.

These questions are the absolute worst and at the same time they’re my favorites lol.,"Why did my supplemental life insurance go up by $100 a month?

My thoughts - Because you want someone to win the lottery when you die. 

The truth - You live in America and most people don’t even have supplemental life. 

What I say - Ah I see. That’s definitely frustrating to see such a high price increase. The price increase is either going to be a straight increase from the client or a cost passover from the carrier. 

Customer - So I should call the carrier?

My thoughts - What? You think anyone can change this for you?

What I say - Yeah you can. They may be able to provide more background information as far as what triggered the increase. Would you like their number?

another one.....

How much are my prescriptions going to be.

What I say - It depends on whether they are generic, preferred or non-preferred. 

Customer - Alright I can give you the names and provides all NAME BRAND drugs and they’re taking triplicates of the same drug for the same issue and triplicates of the same medication in different dosages. 

Turns out all the meds are preferred name brand....

Me - That’s $249 for a 3 month supply. And I say that 10 times. 

another one.....

I get a dialog box on the website that says to continue press cancel. THAT SOUNDS WRONG. WHAT SHOULD I DO? Have you heard of this before?

What I say - There’s a lot of different dialog boxes that can show up. According to that, you’re next step is to click cancel. 

Customer - It just sounded wrong hardy har. Doesn’t it sound wrong?

My thoughts - Maybe if your reading comprehension wasn’t so shit you would have a better time.

Then there’s the people who just made decisions that are completely stupid. 

For example, there’s an HMO and a PPO with a $5 difference. I tell them their preferred provider is only in the PPO and reiterate that 5 times in a row but they choose the HMO and then ask if they can still file claims incurred by their out of pocket costs for this HMO plan out of their spending account. 

Sometimes I will explain something completely thoroughly and the customer will make the decision that makes the least sense. I also don’t like it how customers are only okay with you if you do the work of multiple companies and departments. It’s never enough when you work as a call center agent to just do your job. You always just gotta do way more to get by and I think that part is what gets me the most mad.

These jobs always underpay and they work you harder than other higher paying office jobs.

Thankfully my reputation around the office is somehow amazing which has literally never happened but I get the impression that my manager straight up hates my guts.

I gotta add one to this lol. 

Healthcare costs are so high, says a 62 year old woman only paying $200 a month for medical dental and vision. 

me - well you only have a few more years until you’re medical eligible. 

Her - Yeah but the costs are just astronomical. You have to choose between putting food on the table and being covered by medical. 

What I think - You’re not referring to yourself. And the poor don’t have a choice of purchasing medical or food. The choice is automatic and it’s food.

Her - They really should have medicare for all. But I still think employers should have the ability to provide medical but I don’t think they should have to.

"Well, you should ask one of your 15,000 friends.","A few years back, I did warranties for a company that sold high end hiking back packs.
We had a limited lifetime warranty so basically, unless you dropped your bag in a campfire or dirtied it beyond cleaning, you were good to return it for a repair/ replacement.

I explain to him that's not under warranty, but that there is specific cleaning product he could use that would disinfect without damaging his bag. 
The man starts getting belligerent, probably because he was expecting a new bag, so I even offer to send him some expensive cleaning product we carry FOC.

He tells me he has nowhere to wash it in as he doesn't want to contaminate his bath or sink.
Although this sounds like nonsense to me, I suggest he uses a plastic bucket or container and do it outside, to which he replies that he doesn't have anything like that. 
I ask him if he has any friends he can borrow a bucket from.

It's just another manic Monday....,"So happy Monday to all. How was your day in the call center? 

Today was beautiful..

I had Mr. ""If I ask enough times this will be faster"" for breakfast in the morning.  3 calls over 2 days ( 1 bus day) for a postal mailed report.  I think next time I shall tell him every time he calls he gets put last in the queue and that the system eliminates duplicates.

And...

For lunch I had Ms. ""I'm trying to make it appear I have less govt benefits in my account.  You must fill my oil tank which you say you wouldn't do back in April bc my vent is broke and oil spilled""

Vents prevent spills  btw.. and well I was the one who spoke to her back on the day of the spill and said we would no longer fill the tank while the vent was broke. 

Today she threatened me with a lawsuit because I couldn't put an order in, she had not fixed the issue. Then 3 times she told me she's part of a huge lawsuit. She's a whistle blower against a restaurant and that she told her lawyer about the vent and he said she doesn't have to fix it before we deliver oil. Even though that has caused a previous oil spill there and why we told her we wouldn't deliver until fixed. 

3 times this story.  The 3rd I went ""Yadda yadda, yes you have a lawyer"" I told her my first name so she could tell her lawyer who obviously isn't needing to put much time in her whistle blower case and also needs to address every single one of her failures while using govt money to pay for home heating oil. But when she asked for every one's name in the office.  I said someone will be in contact with you.  And hung up on her. 

I don't get paid enough for anyone crap.


Edit: Oh and while I was in the phone with a customer, a nearby worker was telling a story across the office about her daughter accidentally plucking the first pubic hair off her own daughter thinking it was a loose dog hair. 

I had to talk to my customer louder so she didn't have to hear the gross stupidity. 

 Then I got scolded for wearing an earpiece (bluetooth) that I always wear to drowned out that employee because somehow hearing a soft buzz across the room is more offensive then loudly talking about adolescent pubic hair plucking. It was alternative music at the time.

"Entitled, Sexist, Racist","Okay, so I've been pissed at this situation ever since I got this call from a customer a few months ago. I swear if we call center agents could just complain against rude customers, I would file a lawsuit against this person. 

Anyway, before we delve into the story, I just like to tell you guys that Im a first time poster here!

SO! Details! 

First off, I'm Filipino, and a woman. And I'm working as a telephone banker for a US bank. So mostly all of my calls are from the US. 

Now a bit of background about myself (this is a bit important, I think) I was a working student back in the past, I worked my ass off to provide for my education AND was still able to give more money to my family. Even as a phone banker, Im still able to provide for myself, my family and live very, VERY comfortably AND I'm already investing for a business that I'm putting up by next year.

To sum that up, Im proud to be an independent and successful woman.

And why dear folks am I bothering you with this info? 

Because this particular interraction with the customer makes me want to choke the living hell out of him for being racist, sexist and for feeling entitled. 

* cue flashback *

(Full disclosure, some parts may have been paraphrased since its been almost four months since this call happened)

Me: Hello! This is RS3197 with ""bank name"", may I have your name please? 

C: Is this a US representative?

Me: Um no sir, I'm part of the Philippine branch. 

C: Oh the Philippines, I love the Phillipines! He didnt sound sarcastic at this)

Me: Oh wow! * laughs, trying to build rapport *

----THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN---

C: You know, you people are nobodies!

Me: * me visibly confused * I'm sorry?

C: You people take jobs from us here in the U.S., You are all just dumb folks in Asia that are only good for nothing! YOU HEAR ME?! There's only one Filipino I know that is good and thats Manny Pacquiao (hes talking about the famous filipino boxer) 

* customer rants about Manny pacquiao for several mins* 

Continued~

C: And you, you think you're so sweet but all you Filipinas do is just lie down on your back when you see a foreigner so they could take you to the states and live a comfortable life. You shouldnt even be doing this job! You just need to find a foreign guy and seduce him to taking you to the US! Thats the only thing you are good for! Nothing else! You people take our jobs here in the States when you shouldnt even be working! 

(At this point I was already pissed off of him, but company policy states we cant hang up in our customers)

Me: If thats your opinion, sir. I respect that. May I know what can I do for you regarding your account? (Me trying to be calm and continue the call for auditing purposes)

C: What I need you to do, is to remove this goddamn transaction off my credit card! 

Me: I see. The transaction can be removed sir, I'll just have to transfer you over to my colleagues in the dispute department so they can assist you further. 

(I was customer service, removing transactions or charges were a different department's task, so I did have to transfer him even if he wasnt rude)

C: Oh so now you're transferring me to somebody else! Unbelievable! See? You can't do your job! You should quit! No, don't transfer me! Do your job and remove it right now!

(I was already soooo tempted to hang up on him, he's demanding for me to do something when he wasnt even giving me details about his card info so I can see the account, nor the details about the transaction he wants me to remove, and since its a cancelation of a charge which is another department handles, i could just transfer him directly without taking the details since the other dept will just ask it from him again and we wanted to avoid any frustration from the customer about repeating information. 

Me: Sir, I'm afraid I'm not capable of removing your charge. It is going to be something another department has to do. 

C: No! Cancel it right now or else I'll cancel the card! 

(I was thinking at the back of my head that if this guy cancels his relationship with our bank, it would be one less douche that I would need to handle) 

Me: Sir, even if I want to, I can't because I have no access to cancelation. And if I have no access, meaning I. Cant. Cancel. It. Hence why I need to transfer you over to another department who can REMOVE it for you, IF you DONT WANT to be tranferred then THE CHARGE STAYS because I can't remove it. Even. If. I. Wanted. To. So I'll transfer you now. If. Thats. Alright. With. You?

(My tone started to become monotonous there, The caps lock are me emphasizing the words, not screaming)

C: Fine! You can't do your job, then transfer me to someone who can! You're a waste of money and to think you're getting paid just to talk to the phone, put us on hold or transfer us back and forth!

Me: I'll be transferring you now, please stay on the line.

C: Oh so now you're transferring me to somebody else! Unbelievable! See? You can't do your job! You should quit! No, don't transfer me! Do your job and remove it right now!

(I was already soooo tempted to hang up on him, he's demanding for me to do something when he wasnt even giving me details about his card info so I can see the account, nor the details about the transaction he wants me to remove, and since its a cancelation of a charge which is another department handles, i could just transfer him directly without taking the details since the other dept will just ask it from him again and we wanted to avoid any frustration from the customer about repeating information. 

Me: Sir, I'm afraid I'm not capable of removing your charge. It is going to be something another department has to do. 

C: No! Cancel it right now or else I'll cancel the card! 

(I was thinking at the back of my head that if this guy cancels his relationship with our bank, it would be one less douche that I would need to handle) 

Me: Sir, even if I want to, I can't because I have no access to cancelation. And if I have no access, meaning I. Cant. Cancel. It. Hence why I need to transfer you over to another department who can REMOVE it for you, IF you DONT WANT to be tranferred then THE CHARGE STAYS because I can't remove it. Even. If. I. Wanted. To. So I'll transfer you now. If. Thats. Alright. With. You?

(My tone started to become monotonous there, The caps lock are me emphasizing the words, not screaming)

C: Fine! You can't do your job, then transfer me to someone who can! You're a waste of money and to think you're getting paid just to talk to the phone, put us on hold or transfer us back and forth!

Me: I'll be transferring you now, please stay on the line.

Okay so several people asked for an update on this. Not sure if I did this right or not.

Sadly it's not a good update. It's been just over a week and the company I worke for still haven't cancelled their account. I haven't seen anything in terms of news articles/arrest records. If fact, they've actually gotten service twice since then. The main person on the account was the one that placed the calls which is why they weren't caught in time but I've been informed that if they call in again to just leave it alone.

Now I'm sitting here debating on if I should start looking for a new job because obviously money is more important to this company, than the safety of our drivers/us.

If anything else changes I'll make another update but the fact that they haven't cancelled it yet, means they probably won't. I asked about the driver on Friday when I called the garage he works for but they didn't have an update to give me. Hopefully, that just means there's at least an on going investigation on their end.",604,0,0,"UPDATE: Member drives over our drivers arm and then flees the scene [Orig](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/jcubov/member_drives_over_our_drivers_arm_and_then_flees/)

Remote Support From Home. The Worst Three Years of my Life.,"I worked for three years for a tech support company that major office supply chains and a certain cable company used. The worst three years of my life. None of the techs ever got a raise (“The moment we become profitable!”). And I worked from home.

For six months, I had the manager that 90% of the techs hated. He was incredibly controlling and condescending. How horrible? His screen name was Jor-El and, yes, his avatar was Superman. 

We all know the drill: “Um…you’re 2mins late. Was there traffic?”

There was a lot of bullshit with communication. For instance, I’d get an email saying “Log in and do this training. Do not go live until you’ve completed it.” Five minutes into the training I’d get an IM. “Is there a reason you’re not live? You’re logged in and you’re supposed to be live.” I’d reference the email and rather than say something like “there was a miscommunication” or “let me look into that” he’d say “go live now. Immediately.”

Overtime was always an issue. I had no interest in doing it. I’d constantly get messages from other managers saying “HEY! I see your shift is almost over and I have this feeling that you’re looking for over time!” I’d respond “Ohhhhhh…you’re so wrong about that.” 

This led to the single most horrible corp-speak I’ve ever heard. I got called into a voice meeting about my lack of team-playing by not killing myself for no possibility of a raise. 

Jor-El: So, you’re not doing any overtime.

OP: That’s right. 

Jor-El: I need you to start doing overtime.

OP: Well, is overtime mandatory? Are you forcing me to work more hours than I signed up for?

Jor-El: Well………it’s not mandatory but it is required. 

I laughed out loud. 

From that time forward, he had it in for me. I documented every instance where he tried to slam and abuse me. When the dam finally broke I was completely prepared. It was a tense meeting but I kept my cool. The company mediator obviously wasn’t 100% on my side but in the end, I got what I wanted - a tacit admission that he was being an asshole and I got transferred to another team. 

A couple weeks later, I found out that he “wasn’t working there anymore.” I couldn’t get any of the details but the small bits I was told seemed to indicate that I was not the only one. 

Bonus convo with another manager during an eval:

Manager: So, your customer interface is really great. You listen. You’re polite. You put them at ease and your conflict de-escalation is great. So I’m going to give you a 3 out of 5.

Me: WHUH??

Manager: Yeah, I know. But management won’t let us give a cumulative score higher than 3.2. 

Epilogue: After another miserable conflict with mgmt, I talked about it with my wife and just quit. No notice. About a month later, I get a package from them.

Background: I work for a fairly large bank in the Small Business dept. I take inbound calls from customers all day. Of course, it’s mostly small business owners - but the occasional personal customer can slip through depending on the options they select through the automated system.

I had an older gentleman call on his personal account today. He had a fairly decent balance and a lot of investments in my bank. He made sure to state that several times. Okay sir, that’s great, but how can I help you today?

“Well my accountant was going through my books and says I made a payment to the IRS for about $400. That shouldn’t be. I need to dispute that.”

Me: Okay, happy to help. What’s the date and exact dollar amount so I can dispute?

Him: Idk my account just said an IRS payment for about $400. Can you just look or can you get someone who knows what they’re doing?

I HATE when customers say some shit like this. Don’t demean me by saying I don’t know what I’m doing because YOU are too lazy to look at your account to tell me what I’m filing this freaking dispute on.

He flat out refused to tell me. I suggested maybe he should call his accountant back for more info. Nope. Kept asking me to “just use my eyes and look for it!”

I read out over a dozen transactions with a similar dollar amount (not labeled from the IRS mind you). None of them he said was it. Still keeping my sweet customer service voice, I finally explained I can’t file a dispute on a claim if I don’t know what I’m filing it on.

Customer: Oh don’t give me that crap! Get me your freaking supervisor, you don’t know what your doing!

I had an older gentleman call on his personal account today. He had a fairly decent balance and a lot of investments in my bank. He made sure to state that several times. Okay sir, that’s great, but how can I help you today?

“Well my accountant was going through my books and says I made a payment to the IRS for about $400. That shouldn’t be. I need to dispute that.”

Me: Okay, happy to help. What’s the date and exact dollar amount so I can dispute?

Him: Idk my account just said an IRS payment for about $400. Can you just look or can you get someone who knows what they’re doing?

I HATE when customers say some shit like this. Don’t demean me by saying I don’t know what I’m doing because YOU are too lazy to look at your account to tell me what I’m filing this freaking dispute on.

He flat out refused to tell me. I suggested maybe he should call his accountant back for more info. Nope. Kept asking me to “just use my eyes and look for it!”

I read out over a dozen transactions with a similar dollar amount (not labeled from the IRS mind you). None of them he said was it. Still keeping my sweet customer service voice, I finally explained I can’t file a dispute on a claim if I don’t know what I’m filing it on.

Customer: Oh don’t give me that crap! Get me your freaking supervisor, you don’t know what your doing!

Me: please hold for a few minutes while I connect you..

Get on the line with my supervisor, explain the reason for the escalation. She just goes “well I’m gonna tell him the same thing so bring him on through.”

You’re stupid and your husband sucks,"Mobile.

I’m about 5 months into this call center job and still struggling with my call time. I only need to shave, hmm, about 70 seconds off my average. Really trying to control the call, blah blah, blah. So I worked some OT today and was doing really well with call times. Until my last call. 


I took a call from a lady whose general nationality lends to having shrill voices that go about 90 miles a minute. She ordered an appliance and it had been canceled by the store.  Thus, a credit for that amount has been placed on her account. We sent her a letter about how she didn’t have to include that amount.

What followed next was me explaining in 14 different ways that the credit had been subtracted from the statement balance and the charges on account added for a total. Basically 5 numbers, addition and subtraction. And I’m looking at the timer on my desktop and silently dying inside knowing this call would kill my call time. 

The second worst part was her husband getting on the phone to repeat back to me what I said. The wife then says to me, “Yeah, my husband wouldn’t explain it to me and said to call you.”

I get why he wouldn’t even try because the wife is apparently unable to grasp addition and subtraction. And he sounded like a middle-aged white guy who married this woman because she is of the nationality that is prized for their petite ness. In my mind I was like, “I hope she’s beautiful because she is dammmmmmm stupid.”

I Love Our Older Generation,"  

I have posted about an older repeat caller before, I have not heard from her in a while, but the pandemic has brought out some lonely hearts tired of having no one to talk with her. As I wind down my call center career, since I finally got a non-call center job, I treasure these wholesome diversions to getting yelled at about Lysol Wipes in my preferred field. 

\*I am still on this call while writing this, but this is not she said, I said type of convo since I haven’t said much. 

📷 The call started with her asking if I needed any recipes from her Greek Cookbook that she translated into English. 

📷 I have the same name as her EXDIL, almost Miss Illinois, but divorced her son and took him for $50k; she thinks this woman was a secret lawyer because she knew what she was doing. 

📷 Descriptions of the birth of each of her children. 

📷 Her work history

📷 How she came here from Greece

📷 Her parents, and other family histories. 

📷 13 minutes into the call, she is has given me 3 recipes, even though I told her 3x that I didn’t need them. 

📷 Double checked that I was a Miss and was never married, and then said that means I am a virgin (LOL!!) and would need to know the info about childbirth when I snag a husband (I am not really attracted to men).

📷 Another recipe, Halva, this time. 

📷 She talked about her husband but didn’t sound like she was too fond of him. 

📷 More info on her son and the young lade he is dating, who already has a kid, so must immoral. 

📷 In detail, her church history (not sure of what she said, I tend to zone out when it comes to religion). 

📷 The call is still happening, but she is on a recipe loop, 4th recipe for Halva. 

📷 I have several times tried to steer to what she wanted from me, but I am pretty sure at this point, she is just lonely and longs to hear another human voice. It is these calls that I will miss when I am gone. I have a fondness for older, hell my current partner is 55, which is young for me. I will be on this one for a while, but she is on a loop right now.

Too Much in the Background,"This is my first ever post on Reddit, so please bare with me. TL:DR at bottom

I worked at a call center for 4 years. For the most part all was fine. I eventually moved to the data entry section, but would jump on calls when necessary. Now on to my tale...

A bit of back story, I worked in one of many departments in the center handling a litany of different programs. I did rather well. Some good days, some bad. One of the programs I was working was a call-in recertification for a free wireless phone service provided through the government. In order to qualify for the service you had to be participating in some form of welfare program (food stamps, Medicaid, etc) or have a low enough income. Since this was a recertification we didn't require proof on this program, so we could process over the phone. 

Once we went through the necessary identifying information, we were required to read through the rules and have the caller agree or disagree to the statements. If they disagreed to any one of them, the recert  was ended and denied. One of the statements they had to agree to was something like ""false statements...punishable by law."" Most of the time all went well...until one day when I was talking with this sweet old woman.

I got through all the necessary information and had started on the statements, when I noticed that two of my coworkers behind me were discussing the death of a family member to one of them. This is where things turned bad. I told this poor, sweet, innocent, old lady that if she lied on her certification that it was ""punishable by death."" My coworkers' conversation went in my ear and out my mouth to this woman.

I quickly corrected the mistake and she started laughing hysterically over the phone. I held it in until the call was over. I quickly put myself into ""away from desk"" and went to my supervisor and then the head of the department.  An hour later the head of the department came to my desk laughing and told me she listened to the call a few times. It made her day.

How to turn a $3 parking rate into an arrest.,"So, this is a crazy one folks. My job is to answer the phone for people needing help exiting my companies garages at a university on the normally quiet 3rd shift. 

Around 12:30am, I get a call from a lady

&gt;Lady: ""I paid, but the gate won't go up to let me out""

I check our system and see no charge processed at the gate she is calling from. I inform her of this, and she insists up and down that she paid. So, with nothing I can really do for her, I send out my one field guy to talk to her. I hear nothing for 30 minutes, and figure it was dealt with, until he calls me on the radio.

&gt;Field Guy: ""Uhh, dispatch, she has taken the plates off of her vehicle and I think she's going to run though the gate, can you call University PD?

So, shit just got interesting, and I call PD and send them that way. Its all quiet, for the next hour and a half, just getting updates that the police are still talking to the woman, until I get the final call. 

&gt;Field Guy: ""Dispatch, she is being arrested. Her grandfather is taking the car now, so we don't need to call a tow truck""

I contain my curiosity, and tell him to come to the office for an incident report where I can get the juicy details. 

So, I present for you, the juicy details.

She started her whole spiel of paying to the field guy, but couldn't show any proof. She was asked when she came in and how much she paid. The rate she claims she paid and the time she came in don't match up, so that's strike one. She then changed her story to her mom paid for her. Mom was nowhere to be seen and couldn't be contacted by the driver. Strike two. 

She leaves the gate, and parks in the garage, and the field guy hangs out until she comes back to the gate. Once she is there again, he offers to fill out a form that will let her pay later, or even dispute the charge if she wanted too. That was denied, and she began face timing some guy. Said guy told her to take the plates off of her car, which was when PD was sent.

Once there, the cops began trying to work with her to get her gone, and she kept on refusing and refusing. So the cops get to the point where they ask her for ID...she doesn't have one. Cops ask her if she just forgot it at home.

&gt;Her: ""No, I don't have  license."" 

Yup, she admitted to police that she was driving without a license. Her excuse was that ""The judge told her she could drive"" Which...is not really how that works. Police continue talking to her and trying to resolve this and get her gone, when the guy she was face timing pulls up, gets out, sees cops, than drives away and parks down the street to watch. During this, the field guy watches as she hands her unpaid, supposedly already used parking ticket to an officer, thus turning her whole original story into a lie. 

Cops are getting more and more frustrated with her being completely uncooperative, and when they ask her for her permission to drive the vehicle out of the gate so someone can pick it up, she gets really defensive and weird about it. 

It is unknown who saw what or who told who what, but PD opened her passenger door, and pulled a gun out of the car. My field guy was in his vehicleat this point,  simply watching with his windows up. He rolled his windows down as the lady got on the phone. On the phone, on speaker, was her lawyer, who told her and the cops, in no uncertain terms, that she was not legally allowed to be in possession of a firearm. Her excuse? ""The sheriff said I was allowed to have that"" Nah honey, he didn't. 

Despite all of this, the police were still simply willing to let her go, and impound the vehicle and seize the firearm. You think she would take this, but nope. She was asked for over 30 minutes if her ride was anywhere close, and she refused to answer every time until the police just arrested her. At which point, the face time guy drives off.

So, instead of paying the 3 bucks or taking any of the other literal get out of jail cards, she wasted 2 hours of everyone's time, and is now looking at a $1000 fine for driving without a license, and up to 5 years in prison for the firearm possession.",1551,0,0,"How to turn a $3 parking rate into an arrest.

Download Google Photos...,"This is a funny story for once. Usually stories are terrible experiences but this one was pretty fun.

Don't Ask Questions If You Don't Want the Answer to Them,"Helen is one of the first calls I received. Barely after I finish my opening, she asks for my name again and asks me to spell that out. Already a sign this was not going to be a pleasant call.

She immediately launches into a story about how a company did not deliver all of her order and that they were saying it was out of stock. Instead of giving her a refund, they offer a choice to order something else that was in stock or to wait for her order. Understandably, Helen doesn't accept that and that's why she's calling us to dispute the charge.

I advised her the standard, ""We recommend contacting the merchant first to resolve the issue as it can result in quicker assistance"" and she interrupts me several times by saying she did. Okay, fine. I tell her that a dispute can be setup if she is not able to get this matter resolved directly with the merchant but that we would need additional information from her. She asks what the downsides of opening a dispute would be. I said it can take several weeks to investigate and it could affect her relationship with the merchant.

I must've said something wrong because she starts pushing more questions and seemed somewhat offended with me. One of the last questions she asked me was whether a merchant could take back a credit from us. I told her the truth: Merchants have the right to respond to a dispute and can provide supporting documentation in their defense .

Helen does a 180 on me and immediately asks for a supervisor. I start saying that I would check and she cuts me off and says ""What? WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?"" and I repeat myself. With her change in tone, I apologize to her and she just scoffs and says, ""I'm just trying to give you feedback to improve your customer service because I've been with you for a long time and I've never had anybody speak to me like you did"". She then demands my employee information and I said I would provide it to her and asked if I could place her on a brief hold to check with a supervisor.

Helen: So you can hang up on me??

Me: No, I wasn't going to hang up on you. I was just asking to place you on a brief hold to see if my supervisor is available.

Helen: I want your ID first.

Me: Yes it's 123456. Miss Helen, I do apologize, I was only trying to assist you. I didn't mean to upset you.

Helen: I know, but if you want some advice from me (I didn't), you shouldn't say something like that. That's not good customer service and I know customer service.

Me: I'd be more happy to assist with setting up the dispute still if-

Helen: I don't want your help, GET ME YOUR SUPERVISOR

I apologized and repeatedly told her I'd be more than happy to assist her with her dispute but she wasn't having it. I told her I could arrange for a callback from a supervisor and she said she would call back and talk to somebody else and hangs up. When I accessed her account later to leave a note, I noticed she never called back. She's not the worst person I dealt with but I was shocked at how a call that seemed like it was going to be fine escalated so quickly.

Barely after I finish my opening, she asks for my name again and asks me to spell that out. Already a sign this was not going to be a pleasant call.

She immediately launches into a story about how a company did not deliver all of her order and that they were saying it was out of stock. Instead of giving her a refund, they offer a choice to order something else that was in stock or to wait for her order. Understandably, Helen doesn't accept that and that's why she's calling us to dispute the charge.

Clean up your dog caca and then maybe your install will be completed.,"This is my first time posting here so go easy on me. I work for a cable company that provides internet and phone. Guess who lol. I am the next thing to a supervisor so I handle frontline escalations and overrides on a daily. An agent calls our escalation line stating a customer is upset because the tech did not install their two new cable boxes and told them they should use Roku devices instead. Ok... que me reviewing the notes and recent work orders on the account. The tech marked the order resolution as complete due to unsafe conditions. The notes state he called his supervisor who then called dispatch stating there was feces in the basement and tech could not complete the job until it was cleaned up. I got my giggles out and prepared to take the call. 

The customer begins by saying how frustrated he is and how he is going to a competitor blah blah blah. I listen without interruption. I state the reason the tech left due to caca in the area where he needs to make the connections in the basement. This mans rebuttal is that the dookie was nowhere near where he needed to make the connections. I had to mute myself there to find an appropriate statement without hurting his feelings. I said sir some people can not tolerate certain smells of that nature and round it out with asking if the basement was clean and we could reschedule the appointment. He then says his wife was busy with his niece all morning and didn’t have a chance to clean the area before the tech came. In my mind I’m like who the hell lets their animal crap in their friggin basement for Christ sake!!! Take them outside. I hear the wife in the background like it wasn’t even our dogs that made the mess... so wait your neighbor who shares the space allows them to crap there too. What is wrong with you people.

Then the customer goes that’s not even the main issue. The tech tells me when he gets inside that it’s stupid of him to use cable boxes and to use a roku device they are way better and save you money. In my head that translates to your house stinks and I don’t want to be here lol. He then asks if he should just go to another service provider and of course I reply that is your decision sir you are not in a contract. He asks to speak with someone above me and calls me a cunt while speaking to his wife. I checked the account later in the day and there was no appointment rescheduled so I am guessing they called the competitor.

We’ve got a 2 factor id system for logging in to try and help stop fraudsters. This requires either receiving a phone call or a text with a secure code before you can access things if our system doesn’t recognize the device you’re on. 

Well, Galaxy Karen gets the code and then it makes her log in all over again, in an endless loop of fuckery.

Not your usual customer service,"So I work for a company that basically sends out medical aids. I specifically work in a department that gives people medical aids out of their insurance. To do my job I need to sort of make prescriptions for the medical aids. Some people need beds to die in a some just need some aids to help them get around and others have life long disabilities. I need to know the law, the aids and be able to write these prescriptions. As you might expect this means that I can see a lot of personal information, just like a select few coworkers. This however isn't the case for most people working in the company.

Even tho' you can keep the aids for 6 months untill you need to ask for them at your local government institute, we send out letters at 2 months of use, because the government can be terribly slow. Most people however don't need more than 6 months of use and this often leads to calls, because the letters are standardized. Again... we can't make a distinction between medical needs, because this is very private information. 

This also leads to some weird notes from and to coworkers. You can't say ""Bob isn't able to get out of his bathtub due to weak muscles, and therefore the current medical aid is is insufficient and we need to replace it with this medical aid.""  But we can say ""Medical aid 1 isn't working, get medical aid 2"" There is absolutly no one who can question any decision I make.

Ok... back to the topic. Today I got a lady that was absolutly appalled that we send her a letter. I explained to her that even tho' she doesn't have a need to use them for more than 6 months, there are plenty people who do. To make sure that people don't pay for their own medical aid (they are extremly expensive) we send out these letters. ""OK BUT I FIND IT APPALING THAT I GOT THIS LETTER, IT WASNT MEANT FOR ME."" ""Madam, we can't make that destinction to protect your and others privacy."" She said she understood, but immediately went back to ""Well, ok you're a weird company and I still find it absolutly crazy that you send me a letter that wasn't meant for me."" I have absolutly no time for this bullshit, when people are in need of a bed, because they are quite literally dieing. I told her the information she needed regarding her medical aid and even extended the period she could rent one of her medical aids (that wasn't covered by insurance) free of charge. Because you know... sometimes we do and we understand that some people need help. Even after all of that she was still mad an basically calling us horrible for sending that letter. So I did what I usually do. Ramble all the specifications and information she needed in one big breath and then said ""Do you have anymore questions?"" She stuttered a no. ""No?"" ""Allright then I wish you very well. Have a nice day."" Ofcourse people can't resist to say ""Goodbye."" I mute my phone and go on with my day. Not much of a spectacle, but still needed to get it of my chest.

Here are the basics for anybody who wants to get a medidal aid at expense of insurance:
1. You are not the customer. Your insurance is.
2. I am not going to tell you how sick you need to be in order to get an aid. You tell me.
3. You can call you insurance, and they will do... absolutly nothing. 
4. You don't get the aid while you don't need them, you don't get a speciality bed because you like the convenience. Youre only taking away a bed from somebody who's really in need if you do.

"So you're capable of talking to us like we're actual human beings, you're just choosing to act like a lunatic because you can. Cool.","We sell and support a CRM (Customer Resource Management) software. Basically means that our clients use our software to work with their customers. So for troubleshooting purposes, we of course as tech support have the ability to log in as that client and look at any activities they've done in their live environment. This includes conversations within the system between them and their customers.

We have one lady who, whenever she calls in, probably articulates worse than a child raised by wolves. She gets worked up over very minor issues, usually user error, and gets more frustrated the more you try to figure out what the hell she's talking about. 

Her email tickets are even worse. ""HELP LOG IN MEMAIL CLIENTS BLOCKED WTF"". ""REPORTS BROKEN CAN'T READ UNACCEPTABLE CALL NOW.""

Thankfully, she doesn't call in very often at all.

But if you're trying to troubleshoot, and happen to go into her account to see/listen to the conversations she has with her own customers....she's very polite, clear, concise, and friendly. She just reserves the fragmented Caveman Karen speech for us unworthy plebs.

The most awkward customer question ever,"I work in a job that is a mix of tech support and customer service. We provide both phone and chat support to our clients. My company is very customer-focused and they allow us to make small talk with the client as long as it doesn't take us away from helping them, or other clients, and not to be excessive.

This happened a few years ago, so I don't remember the exact details of why the client contacted us, but I know it was a fairly complicated issue that included the use of screen sharing and I had to get our lead support rep involved as well as a developer to fix his issue. This was handled through our chat support line and as the client was in India, and speaking Hindi, I was using our chat's translate feature to communicate with the client.

What sticks with me to this day, and why I'm here dear friends is for what ensued after the issue was fixed.

Me: Obviously Me  
DMC: The Client

Me: Is there was anything else I could help with today?

DMC: M or F

Me: I'm female. Yourself?

DMC: Male. Are you Married or Single?

Me: I'm married. We just celebrated our 19th wedding anniversary last month.

DMC: Are you a virgin?

Call Centre ‘Nam Flashbacks,"I have since left my last job for multiple reasons, but I figured to share one last juicy story of how my last day of the job went.

So to preface it, I was working for a video game console company. I shall leave it to your imagination to figure out which one, and will neither confirm or deny it.

I will however say, that to whoever called me that day, which I will call Angry Australian Man-child (AAM) thanks for the mental trauma...

So, on to the story. It’s the last call of my last day at work, I do my usual “Thanks for calling us, how can I help you today?”

The call came through to our console support line and Angry Australian Man-child is on the other end of the line. He has an issue with his console. It’s a common issue, they accidentally knocked their power cord, corrupted their hard drive, and the console is in safe mode, needing a software installation file.

Now, normal people, at the very least, have a computer or laptop for everyday use. One simply needs to go to our website and download the right file from said site, put it into a flash stick of decent size, and simply plug it in and follow the prompts.

But not Mr. Man-child, oh no, he bragged like an arrogant fanboy about “not having a computer because our console was all he needed as it’s the best”.

Whilst I thanked him for the compliment, this unfortunately made support for him that much more difficult. This was especially the case with the current situations going on.

So, after taking down his details to log his call and incident, I asked politely, “Okay, well....do you have any neighbours or friends that you could borrow a computer or laptop device?”

To this Mr. Man-child said no. Figures.

The next solution that I asked was, “Right...Do you have access to a Public Library of any sort? They most likely have computers you can use.”

Mr. Man-Child did hint likely of this, so that was one option to utilise, and for me an out at least.

Last question I asked was, “Okay, that’s one avenue we can proceed with. The alternative is if you have a smart device, do you use an Android or Apple Device?”

Thankfully, Mr. Man-Child said Android.

With this I had his solution plan laid out for him,” Okay, here is what I can do for you, I will be sending you an email to your contact email with instructions. It’s very important you have access to a computer and flash drive to do this, sir. 

Alternatively, you can use your mobile phone to download the file, but you will need a special cable to transfer the file and format the flash drive to the right settings.

Once you follow those instructions, to the letter, you should be able to have your console back up and run-“

To this, Mr. Man-Child decided to interject and ask, “So you’re saying my console is broken?”

Confused as to why he asked that, I politely reiterated that his console wasn’t broken, namely that it’s in safe mode needing the software to be installed on it. I explained to him a PC analogy of BIOS screen if one’s operating system is corrupted or non existent.

This however didn’t deter Mr. Man-Child to make a wild assumption, “So that means my console won’t be fixed?! That means it’s useless! I spent a lot of money on this console!”

I reiterated, “Sir, your console just needs a software installation. I have explained how it can be fixed, you just need a computer and flash drive, okay?”

Next thing I hear is Mr. Man-Child, after a brief pause, starting to smash his console, cursing and yelling up a storm.

I had to cut the call at the point, I wasn’t paid to take his abuse.

But at least now he can say his console is broken, and if he calls support again, I’d love to see him try to explain why his out of warranty fee should be waived.",471,0,0,"Call Centre ‘Nam Flashbacks I have since left my last job for multiple reasons, but I figured to share one last juicy story of how my last day of the job went.

Member drives over our drivers arm and then flees the scene,"[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/jhrkam/update_member_drives_over_our_drivers_arm_and/)

So some background info. I work in emergency roadside assistance (ERS) as a dispatcher (DI). Night shift doesn't always have a supervisor and last night was one of those nights which is why we found out about this right way. The DI from 3rd shift immediately messaged our supervisor when she got in around 6:30am. This happened at 4am last night.

So like I just said, we got a call around 4am last night for a vehicle the had no keys. The driver goes out and arrives on location but the customer wasn't there yet. So while he was waiting for the customer to arrive, he starts loading the vehicle up. Well the customer arrives and she and (We're assuming it's her husband/boyfriend) jump out and tell the driver they no longer need service.

So the driver says okay just let me get it unhooked. Instead of the member waiting for him to finish, they jump in the vehicle while it was still on the back of his truck. (This is a big no no) As he's removing the last chain, the member starts the car and throws the vehicle in reverse and guns the vehicle off the back of the truck and RUN OVER THE ARM OF THE DRIVER IN THE PROCESS.

Now, most people would immediately stop and offer to call an ambulance or to at least check on the driver but nope. They took off. The driver ends up call us and (understandably) was screaming and crying from the pain. The DI that got his call ended up calling an ambulance for him but did lose connection with him and he didn't answer when she called him back. She ended up calling the owner of the company he worked for (we call them garages) to let them know what happened.

My supervisor did call the owner herself as well and thankfully the driver is doing okay. They're talking to the member now and will be filing a police report. I just want to know what was going through the members head because I'm pretty sure that if you didn't FEEL it when you ran over his arm that you would have figured it out by the drivers screams. Their accounts been sent to our critical incident team for review and I told my supervisor that if they don't lose their membership after this, that I will lose all faith in the company going forward. Because they could have killed the driver.",981,0,0,"Member drives over our drivers arm and then flees the scene [Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/jhrkam/update_member_drives_over_our_drivers_arm_and/)

The one answer that NOBODY ever understood.,"Ok, so this story is about my time with a life insurance company. There was one question/request I received basically every single day. and not a single person ever came remotely close to understanding the answer. Maybe you can tell me why?

Background: There's two basic types of insurance companies in one sense, mutual companies (policyholders co-own the company) or stock companies (people that own shares of stock own that much of the company).  If you start as a mutual, and convert to a stock company, you have to give your existing policyholders an appropriate amount of stock in the company so they keep their ownership.  This happened maybe 15 years before I started working there, so plenty of people got some stock this way.  That part can be a little confusing, but it's not vital to know either for this story. What you need to know, is they possess a stock certificate in our company. Go.

Every single day, I got a call that went like this:

""Hi, I have this stock in your company, and I want to trade it in for cash.""

*""Ok, well you got that from (explains process above in layman's terms), and now it's just like any regular stock, you buy, sell, trade stock just like you would any other stock you own or have in your portfolio, but you can't call the company and trade it for cash.""*

""No, you don't understand, you sent me this stock years ago, but I don't want it anymore, I just want to get a check for what it's worth!""

*""Oh, I understand, but selling stock is done through a stockbroker, or bank, or financial institution, or probably many more other ways, but you can't just redeem it through customer service, for us or any other company.""*

""So you're refusing to give me the money for my stock?""

*""No... I'm telling you that stock doesn't work this way.  If you owned Wal-Mart stock, you can't just take it to the customer service desk for cash.  This is the same. If you have any investments, or know where you'd go if you wanted to make some, probably your bank, go to that same person for this. If they can't help you for some reason, they'll know exactly where to send you.""*

""So this is just worthless, that's what you're telling me?""

*""No, just, if you don't have anyone you trade stocks with already, call your bank, I'm sure they'll be happy to tell you what your options are.""*

""The bank didn't give this to me, you did!  Let me talk to your manager!""

I understand for some people, this might be the only stock they owned, and were unsure at first, but I think the explanation works?  Also, I talked to plenty of people paying thousands of dollars a month for multi-million dollar policies, I can't believe that not a single one of them has a portfolio or financial guy at their bank or SOMETHING.

*""No... I'm telling you that stock doesn't work this way.  If you owned Wal-Mart stock, you can't just take it to the customer service desk for cash.  This is the same. If you have any investments, or know where you'd go if you wanted to make some, probably your bank, go to that same person for this. If they can't help you for some reason, they'll know exactly where to send you.""*

""So this is just worthless, that's what you're telling me?""

*""No, just, if you don't have anyone you trade stocks with already, call your bank, I'm sure they'll be happy to tell you what your options are.""*

""The bank didn't give this to me, you did!  Let me talk to your manager!""

I understand for some people, this might be the only stock they owned, and were unsure at first, but I think the explanation works?  Also, I talked to plenty of people paying thousands of dollars a month for multi-million dollar policies, I can't believe that not a single one of them has a portfolio or financial guy at their bank or SOMETHING.  But every single time a call started with stock, it ended with bafflement."

"""We already had this conversation yesterday""","I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

Some people can't take no for an answer. I received this customer last monday. She was flying to day to Lynchburg, VA. Problem was that at the time of her arrival (1900), the rental car facility would be closed. Unhappy with the regular agent's response, she demanded to escalate the call.

H: HenriquesDumbCousin
C: Customer
C2: Customer 2

H: I do apologize ma'am, but the location would be closed by then

C: Can you call the location and tell them to wait for me? 

H: No ma'am, I wouldn't be able to get in contact with them

C: But why would they close the location if flights are still coming? 

I shrugged.

H: I wouldn't have an answer. It's unfortunate to say the least, I'm sorry for the inconvenience

The customer finally loses it.

C: What is your name? What is your name?

H: HenriquesDumbCousin

C: I'm going to write your name, let me grab something to write...

H: HenriquesDumbCousin

C: Okay, what is your name?

H: HenriquesDumbCousin

C: And what's your last name HenriquesDumbCousin

H: I do apologize but I can't share that information.

C: Why not?

H: For security reasons, of course.

H: I'm just telling you the policies, ma'am

C: Your company is such a joke, you're such...

*Click*

H: ... bitch

Entitlement and irrational anger, my favorite combination. Thankfully the call was brief.

She called again the next day. Apparently her daughter was already at Lynchburg, VA, but due to her age there would be underage fees if she rented the vehicle. 

C: I want my daughter to pick up the rental, but I was wondering if at the time of pick up they can change the name on the rental to mine to avoid the underage fees

H: No, that wouldn't be possible

C: WHY NOT?

H: It's not possible to change the renter's name in the middle of the rental 

C: What is your last name HenriquesDumbCousin?

H: We already had this conversation yesterday, ma'am...

C: I knew it was you!

H: This reservation is not going to work

C: What is your...

H: HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAY!

*Click*

I was immediately reminded of this other customer I had back on September. Her reservation was both pick up and drop off at LGB (Long Beach Airport). Problem was that her return flight was at SFO (San Francisco Airport). When she tried to modify the reservation, it wasn't possible.

C2: But you have cars available at Long Beach, you just told me

H: Yes, but they only have vehicles for round trips, they won't allow you to take the vehicle to San Francisco

C2: Why not?

H: Well, speculation from my end, but I suppose they don't have enough vehicles in their fleet, they can't afford to lose one, then again, it's just speculation from my end

C2: Can't you fix it?

H: No

C2: This is such poor customer service. I work for customer service, you know, **and I always go the extra mile to help my customers**. I would call the location and tell them to make it possible

At this point I had the same expression Jack Sparrow did in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, specifically when the stone-crab thingies start to move the Black Pearl through the desert.

H: Yeah... I can't do that

And that's the thing, they refuse to accept the reality that it's not possible to fulfill their requests. They have no problem pointing fingers at me, it's my fault for ""not going the extra mile"". Yeah, fuck them.

**FAQ**

**What to do in a situation like this?**

It is possible to submit a request for an agent to wait for a customer after hours. Needs to be done with at least 72 hours in advance and the customer must provide the arrival flight.

Please be aware that it's a request, not a guarantee that someone will wait for the customer after the location closes. So even if she calls with 72 hours in advance, the request can be declined. Still, I would have offered this option if it wasn't her poor response to the situation.

**What happens if my flight is delayed and I arrive after the location closes?**

Chances are that the agents at the counter will leave, and the only options will be to either reschedule the reservation for the next day or cancel it and get a full refund. It's definitely unfortunate, but there's nothing an agent in a call center can do about it.

**Wow you're a piece. They arent cussing at you. Fucking bullshit**

Make it quick!,"I work as a technical support/escalated call handler for an insurance call center. I work a late night shift. Most of my calls are helping reps navigate the ins and outs of various insurance contracts. One of my many duties of this job is understanding underwriting criteria and explaining it to others, including customers when they request to hear my lovely voice. As a result, I oftentimes deliver bad news. This call was definitely not an exception.

As insurance is regulated on a state level, something that can pass muster in one state may not cut it in another state. If we find that your policy is written for State X, but you and your insured item live in State Y, we will make you rewrite for your new state. If you don't rewrite, we'll nonrenew your policy.

Cast of Characters: Me, Enraged Customer (EC), and Rep

Me: Customer Support Line, this is mentalgopher, how may I help you today?

Rep: You see Enraged Customer's policy coming up?

Me: Yeah, what's wrong?

Rep: He's mad because it ended last week and he can't renew it. He wants to speak with a supervisor about it.

Me: Send him through.

(Rep breathes a sigh of relief and transfers the caller to me.)

Me: Hi, my name is mentalgopher. Am I speaking with Enraged Customer?

EC: Yeah, you f\*\*kin' @$$holes cancelled my f\*\*kin' policy without tellin' me.

Me (Reviewing notes): Well, sir, we have you living in State Y, correct?

EC: Yeah I moved, but that's got f\*\*kin' nothin' to do with nothin'.

Me: Well, your policy is written for State X, so it has everything to do with everything. Did you check your emails for these notices sent on dates A, B, C, and D reminding you that this policy was not renewing?

EC: I didn't get no f\*\*kin' emails.

Me: Okay, but you quoted a new policy for State Y about three weeks prior to the first notice being emailed. We also mailed you notifications via USPS.

EC: You gonna f\*\*kin' fix my policy or what?

Me: Well, you're gonna have to write a new policy for State Y.

EC: Listen, I gotta f\*\*kin' give Lyft proof of insurance or I'll get dropped. Can we make this f\*\*kin' quick?

To EC's credit, his nonrenewed personal auto policy had the endorsement for driving this vehicle for a Transportation Network Company (TNC). However, not all states allow all insurers to have the TNC endorsement on a personal auto policy. So we would usually refer EC to our commercial auto division for a livery policy (fancy word for taxis). But this insurer isn't necessarily able to write a livery policy in all states. EC was living in state Y, which not only does NOT allow for TNC endorsements on a personal auto policy with this insurer, but also does not allow our commercial division to write livery policies.

Me: Yes. As you've told me on a recorded line that you drive for Lyft, we can NOT offer a personal auto policy for you in State Y. Normally, I'd refer you to our commercial division. However, we don't write the alternative policy type we normally offer to customers in your situation in State Y, either. You'll need to seek insurance elsewhere.

EC then proceeds to go on a rant about how every insurance company is comprised of communists, we're out to get him and screw over the little guy. He does it for almost seven straight minutes without taking a breath or giving any room for me to cut in. Then he stops and realizes what he's done.

EC: I told you to make it f\*\*kin' quick!

Me: I did. I told you no and why it wasn't happening. Did you have any other questions?

EC: Don't take up so much of my valuable time! \*click\*

Not Listening,"So, I work at a call center for an electric company and one of the calls we get most is about payment arrangements for the bill. I am happy to help, but I'd be even happier if I didn't get yelled at because of a misunderstanding.

So we started out fine. I took a small payment, then she asked about a payment arrangement for the rest of her past due bill. I explained what we could do for her. The first payment is always due like the next week and it defaults to an amount that would be similar to the payments further out. So say her total was $300, split into 6 payments. $50 due next week. She tells me that she cannot pay that so soon. So when I want to help out a customer, I start thinking of ways that I can go around the system. So I made her first payment $5 due today (which I'm not really supposed to do without a supervisor's approval but that rule isn't heavily enforced). Since she already made a payment today, it would go towards that. Then the next payment would be due in a month, so she would have plenty of time to get the money. 

I explain all this to her, she accepts, and then we talk about other things for like 10 seconds. I go back to summarize the process and tell her the first payment is due today and before I can remind her that its already paid, I get:

C: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME!! I TOLD YOU I AM ON A FIXED INCOME AND I CAN'T PAY ANYTHING!! 

M: *in the calmest voice* I am listening to you ma'm. I know-

C: NO, YOUR'E NOT!! I CAN'T PAY ANYTHING ELSE TODAY!!

So I made her first payment $5 due today (which I'm not really supposed to do without a supervisor's approval but that rule isn't heavily enforced). Since she already made a payment today, it would go towards that. Then the next payment would be due in a month, so she would have plenty of time to get the money. 

I explain all this to her, she accepts, and then we talk about other things for like 10 seconds. I go back to summarize the process and tell her the first payment is due today and before I can remind her that its already paid, I get:

C: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME!! I TOLD YOU I AM ON A FIXED INCOME AND I CAN'T PAY ANYTHING!! 

M: *in the calmest voice* I am listening to you ma'm. I know-

C: NO, YOUR'E NOT!! I CAN'T PAY ANYTHING ELSE TODAY!! 

M: M'am, I am listening to you, but you've got to listen to me. You don't need to pay anything else today. I am trying to help you. 

C: Oh...

I can still hear her yelling into my ear."
“Well that’s just asinine! I’ll just pay the balance if that’s the case!”,"Today I worked on chat support where I also take escalations. 

Account came through, no payments since June/July. 

Built up a balance between now and then, wanting to work out a payment plan. Agent transfers the customer to my line. I laid it out how said plan would work, and then they stopped me mid sentence. 

“That just adds up to what I owe”

“Yes- and without penalty it can be paid over the course of —“

“No. Well this was all a waste of time. Well that’s just asinine! If I have to pay it all I’ll just do that when I pay my bill anyway.

I’m sending the underground mafia after you,"I work in auto/cycle insurance. As I’m sure most of you know, your policy has to match what state you live in as each state has different rates, minimum liability limits, etc. If it doesn’t match it can cause issues if a claim is filed.

For a bit more background, when this man called in and I quickly flipped over to see if there were any recent notes or activities to be aware of I found PAGES of notes from supervisors. To summarize the situation that has been going on for months: the man disclosed he did not live in the state his policy and address were listed as since he was a traveling musician. All we really needed from him was proof of residency. No big deal right? After looking over all the notes, I knew exactly where this convo was going and mentally prepared myself to parrot the exact same things my supervisors have already told him multiple times.

Me: Hello, sir, how can I help today?

Caller: Yes, we’re having a bit of an ongoing issue. All I want to do is make a payment but no one will let me.

M: I understand, sir. Unfortunately, due to no proof of residency being sent in I cannot take a payment today. You’re due to expire soon and unless that’s sent in we can’t lift the non renewal cancellation.

C: What do I need to send in?

M: We can accept any of the following: [provides 8 options]

C: Well I don’t have any of those.

M: Not even a current utility bill?

C: No, I get my mail at that address you have but I don’t live there. Can I send in a bank statement?

M: We cannot unfortunately.

C: Why not?

M: It does not fall under the list of acceptable proof of residency per our company guidelines.

C: Well what about the bills you send me?

M: No.

C: Why the hell not? That counts as a bill!

M: We have to send the mail somewhere and using ourselves as proof of residency does not fall under acceptable.

C: Heh, this is ridiculous. If I can’t send in anything then what can I do?

M: Then the policy is going to cancel and will not be renewable. I do apologize but we need to have acceptable proof to keep the policy active.

C: You know what? I’ve already notified the insurance commissioner of what you guys and the local agencies are doing and he’s gonna keep a real close eye on this case. I’m taking all of you companies and you reps to court and sue the hell out of you for tampering with my identity and discrimination against old and disabled people. **CLICK**

Turns out he called back later that week and got the supervisor who trained me.

Needless to say, he was labeled as a threat and handled by the managers. He won’t be getting insurance with us again.

Life Insurance Woes,"One of the call centres I used to work at was as a life insurance rep for a major Canada/US company.  It is frustrating to have to give someone bad news when someone in their family recently died, but luckily, many of them are simply greedy people that are way more concerned about a free payday than the loss of a loved one. I do have a lot of sympathy for someone losing a loved one, but not for someone trying to use a death as a way to get one over on the insurance company, there is a line. The three most common kinds of frustrating calls I had, naturally, all had to do with money, no surprise there: (all of these have been approximated to the average question from them and average responses by me)

1) ""My (relative) died a little while ago, and in their things, I found this life insurance policy from 1963, how do I go about claiming this?""

*Well, yes they took one out in 1963, but then they stopped paying for it in 1966. No, I don't care that you have a physical policy in your hand that says you're entitled to money.  We don't just come and break in your house and punch you until you give it back.  It isn't worth anything unless you follow all the parts of the policy until they pass away, including paying us. No, I don't care that you think they did. I know they didn't, so unless you can find me some proof of that.  No, I don't care that you'll sue us because you're holding a policy. This will not make it to court, that's a contract which they stopped following 50 years ago, not an IOU.*

2) ""My (relative) is in the hospital, they're not going to make it, how do I claim this policy?

*(Disclaimer, if this were a five, ten thousand dollar policy that the caller was worried about because it was the only way they were going to pay for a funeral, I would have some sympathy to the issue in that situation, for sure.  This was virtually never the case. This was virtually always an entitled-sounding grandkid with a very expensive policy.) Um, first they actually have to pass away.  No, being sick and close is not good enough.  No, I don't want to talk to the doctor.  No, you need a death certificate first.  No, you can't fill out most of the form right now and send that in later.  NO WE CAN'T TAKE YOUR WORD THAT THIS IS ""CLOSE ENOUGH""*

3) ""I'm cancelling my policy.  Since I never used it, how do I get back all that money I put into it?""

*(Disclaimer #2, there are certain kinds of policies where you do get money back when you cancel it, depending on circumstances and type, I'm not going to get into those. Suffice it to say, these calls were never those kinds of policy.) ""Yeah, I do realize that you didn't use it.  Life insurance is rather cut and dried that way.  But, uh, no, you don't get back the money you put into it because you didn't use it. That's how insurance works. Yes, really.  Yes, really, like your car, or like your house. You don't get your money back if they didn't get damaged in the last year, do you? We wouldn't make a profit that way.  No, it's not a scam, I promise. No, this isn't illegal.  Yes, I'm really really sure. Oh? You aren't going to use our company next time?  What exactly do you picture the ""next time"" being?*

And now for a short but funny story about call center life bleeding into real life,"I've worked in a call center for just about a decade now. When that happens, it impacts the way you answer any phone calls as I'm sure everyone here knows. 

Well I volunteer for an animal rescue on my days off (because if this job has taught me anything, animals &gt; people). With my experience, I've basically become the dedicated rescue customer service face and am in charge of answering any calls we get on the little rescue flip phone. 

Queue today. Rescue phone rings. I answer as normal. 

Me: Thank you for calling [rescue] my name is Hashtagsi. How can I help? 

Applicant: ....

Me: Hello? Can you hear me? 

Applicant: ""oh shit. I thought you were a recording! Sorry!"" 

Me: Oh yeah. That happens a lot when you work in a call center. Sorry about that. 


Short interaction, we shared a good laugh, but I thought you guys might relate. 

As a side note: the best thing about volunteering for incoming calls? If someone's a jerk, their application gets denied. I like to think it's a way to rescue any future customer service folks those people will come in contact with. Rescue within a rescue I guess. 

Last thing: anyone who works for a phone call center, we are coming up on the tough part of the year. Keep your head up and remember, no matter what the customer says, you're amazing. Keep up the great work.

Last thing: anyone who works for a phone call center, we are coming up on the tough part of the year. Keep your head up and remember, no matter what the customer says, you're amazing. Keep up the great work.

Funny little story about someone angry at not wanting to give information needed to better assist them.,"This happened many years ago when I used to work in the call center at a VA hospital. When a veteran calls in, we have to ask for their last name and last 4 of their social security number in order to verify that it’s actually them since there are an incredible number of vets with the same last name. Pretty standard across all VA hospitals in the U.S. The vast majority of the vets that call in don’t have a problem with this. This is a story of one who did.

Me: Thank you for calling the ___ VA. This is Gwent4Life. How may I help you?

(I worked in the specialty center which housed the orthopedic, podiatry, ENT, surgical, dental, etc. You get the picture.)

Vet: I need to speak to Dr. ____. (Head of the clinic).

Me: Okay. Did he call you directly?

Vet: No! Just let me talk to him! 

(Guy was already getting angry and the call just started.)

Me: Okay. What’s your name sir?

Vet: (Gives first name).

Me: Okay. What’s your last name?

Vet: You don’t need to know! Just get me Dr. ___!

(Guy is yelling into the phone at this point.)

Me: (In a calm voice) Well I kinda need t know who is calling for Dr. ____ as it is something that the doctors like to know. 

Vet: I don’t fucking care! Just give me Dr ____. 

Me: Sir, I must ask you refrain from cussing or else I’ll have to terminate the call. Now please, tell me your last name and I can see what I can do.

Vet: I ain’t giving you shit! If you ain’t going to help me, then you can fuck off!

*click*

I laugh a little to myself and with my coworkers. Then the phone rings again. I got the same guy again. At this point I make a mental note of the phone number. 

Me: Thank you for calling ____ VA. This is Gwent4Life, how may I help you?

Vet: Get me Dr. ____!

Me: (knowing it’s the same guy) Ok sir. What’s your name and last 4?

Vet: You’re not getting shit from me, just be a good little boy and get me the fucking doctor!

Me: I’m sorry sir, but I have to know who is calling in order to inform the doctor. 

Vet: This is going fucking nowhere! Fuck you!

*click*

I tell my coworkers he called again and hung up a second time. We laugh a bit and I tell them to forward me the number if they see it.

My coworkers phone rings, and he says it’s the same guy. I tell him to forward it to me.

Me: Thank you for calling the _____ VA. This is Gwent4Life, how may I help you?

Silence. For only a couple seconds but felt like longer.

Me: Hello? Is anyone there? (In my kindest, sweetest voice)

Vet: long pronounced sigh.

*click*

This happened at the end of the day. At 4:30 pm the phones shut off and the calls get routed to information, and they are far less helpful. I laughed again, gathered my stuff, and left.

Saw the post from u/Hashtagsi and the title reminded me of the time call center life took over in regular conversation,"Well I work at a call center for a well known bank, usually I would answer back to back calls but had recently switched to a retirement account specialist position where I took MAYBE 10 calls a day. On this day in particular I had a difficult customer who needed me to break down every little thing regarding their retirement account and explain all the processing the state and federal do with taxes. 

Later that day my friend called me and we were talking, I started ranting about said interaction and accidentally slipped into my customer service voice while explaining to him how retirement accounts worked and why I was upset. At one point he said “ahhh okay. I get it now” which is what my customer said as wel. So my automatic response was “fantastic, is there anything else I can help you with today?” Then silence. I quickly realized what I said and apologized profusely. My friend was like “damn u/imeghann I thought you were done with me or something.” We ended up having a good laugh about it and now he teases me about it constantly.",36,0,0,"Saw the post from u/Hashtagsi and the title reminded me of the time call center life took over in regular conversation Well I work at a call center for a well known bank, usually I would answer back to back calls but had recently switched to a retirement account specialist position where I took MAYBE 10 calls a day.

Being naive can bite you... in the foot?,"More tales from the psychic line!

I’m minding my own business one day, a fresh faced, innocent little 20-something, when my phone rings. Being the dutiful employee I am, I answer. 

It’s a sale call, and so I start chatting the guy up a bit before I ease into the sales pitch. It’s going good. He tells me he owns a shoe store, and I jokingly ask him if he’s got shoes in my size (I’m a woman who has very, very large feet). He boggles at my shoe size, like most people do. We share a chuckle over how the only shoes I could find at the time that were female in any capacity was from websites for drag queens. 

I didn’t get it right away when he starts probing a bit about how my feet are shaped. After all, he’s a shoe store owner, right? So I innocently answer some of his questions until I realize his voice is starting to take on this...tone. 

You know the tone. A little too interested, a smidge deeper, a touch too flirty. 

And then I hear it: the unmistakable sound of a man spanking that little monkey for all it’s worth.

All I could say was “Gross!” as I disconnected. 

And then I got scolded for not trying to pitch the sale anyway.",95,0,0,"Being naive can bite you... in the foot? More tales from the psychic line!

The happiest customer I had in the worst company I worked for," 

(Disclaimer: this was about 13 years ago, I don't remember the exact tech support steps as I haven't worked on this setup in 12 years as well. This could probably go in [r/talesfromtechsupport](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/) as well, but I think it's more of a commentary on call centres)

I was working in the cable internet company that the US probably hates the most as the most senior person of our tech 1.5 (the team that handles the weird one-offs that tier 1 gets, in theory, and has a little more access to our software, in the same room) Within my building of hundreds of employees, I was the final go-to person on anything that could be solved in-house (without tier 2 escalation or higher)

I spent 98% of my time helping tier 1 through their days. However, the way employee metrics worked for annual review, I had to take a few tier 1 calls a week so that I'd have numbers for average call time and all that jazz that we hated. Background over.

Customer calls in, polite but very direct that he's had an internet problem he hasn't been able to get fixed, he's called us repeatedly, called his computer manufacturer who says it's our fault, nothing too uncommon. The notes on his account back it up, it appears previous reps have made a worthwhile effort at trying to solve it. He says this is the last chance we have before he cancels and goes elsewhere. (Which doesn't bother me, but I try to do my job right)

He's a really reasonable guy, I tell him that I'll promise to take every step in the book with him to check everything we possibly can, and he agrees to let me try. And to his credit, he does every single thing I ask him, and we cut zero corners on the steps. He checked every cable, removed and replaced them as asked, clicked everything I told him to click and nothing else, read everything he saw on his screen right to me. He was an excellent customer.

So, the modem is getting everything it needs. Looks correct through my tools and the lights on his end. Computer is pulling an ip address valid for our network. Browser comes up with being unable to connect to anything. Cleared every cache and cookie and etc thing I could think of, no go.

Now, through all of this, I'm following our ticketing system (which includes a troubleshooting tree) to the letter, looking at my reference material as to what he should be seeing. We're getting down to what I know from experience is one of the final steps before my system says ""not our problem."" We get to checking the tcp/ip settings (this is where my tech support memory fails me as to exactly what tcp/ip settings so don't ask but I'll approximate it)

""Ok, so can you check that settings A, B, and C say this?) I ask.

""Yep, A, B, and C are exactly that. And Box D is unchecked.""

Internally: ""Wait a sec. Box D isn't in the troubleshooting tree, but my reference material shows Box D being checked...it sounds somewhat relevant, I guess?""

""Um, can you check Box D for me? And now, check your internet?""

""OH MY GOD THE INTERNET WORKS!""

The customer then goes on and on about how thrilled he is that his problem is finally solved, and how much work I put into checking every last thing for him, how I solved it after all the hours he spent trying to get this fixed. He asks to speak to my manager, which I of course let him do, stayed on the line and heard him gush to my boss for a solid 10 minutes.

Couple hours later, the Quality Assurance guy (the guy that listens to recordings to make sure we're doing our job right and scores them) comes over and tells me he listened to that call, and then presents me with my scoresheet, a big fat zero, lowest score possible.

""You went out of scope, Box D isn't in the troubleshooting tree. Zero.""

A win!,"This is a silly happy story about a call that started badly and ended well.

My Sunday shift *should* have been a quiet and easy day, with plenty of time to catch up on true crime articles in between sparse calls.

It was not to be.

Many customers buy our product regularly, every week. After extensive advertising to warn everybody, our most popular flagship product changed on Saturday.

So Sunday was HOT with ""how DARE you make these changes??!!"" and ""I don't UNDERSTAND"" and of course ""why didn't you tell me about the change??!!""

It actually wasn't toooo bad. The queue didn't let up all morning, but I mostly got the calmer customers who simply didn't understand the changes and needed someone to explain it clearly.

And then I got a call from a woman in her late 70s who had a medical condition which caused her to talk ... very ... slowly. She needed to gasp between each word.

Ask a stupid question.....,"Please do not use this story elsewhere. Hope you enjoy!

I try to be professional. I really do. However, now and then I encounter someone who asks something a bit.....stupid.

This was way back in 2008. The Theme Park company I worked for had instituted a transport system to get people from the airport to their on-site hotel. It was pretty spiffy, and we had people asking about it all the time. One person had called and was asking about hotels, tickets, dining options, all the usual stuff. I was ready to put together a modest package that wouldn't exactly bump up my commission that month, but would help maintain a respectable average. Then we finally got to the crucial question.

Me: So, let's put this all together. When did you plan on coming to visit us?

Guest: Oh I probably won't be coming until somewhere around 2015.

My brain, slightly stroking out: Are....are you f-ing serious right now? You've been jawing away for forty minutes about a trip you plan on taking more than half a decade from now? Are you insane?

Me: Well bear in mind, things my change by then, especially the pricing we've discussed....

Guest: Oh yes of course. But, one more question. Will they still have the \[Complimentary Bus Service\] at that point?

At that moment, two things happened simultaneously. First, I finally snapped and decided I was done with this call. Second, my team leader came walking down the aisle behind me and was just passing me as I said:

""No, ma'am, we'll have discontinued \[Complimentary Bus Service\] by that point in time.""

Remember The Exorcist, when Linda Blair's head spun around? I think my leader was glaring at me a full three seconds before her body caught up with the turn. I had a vague awareness of the guest sounding disappointed.

""However,"" I continued, looking at my leader as I spoke, ""we will be instituting a new program, where big, burly Scandinavian men will haul you and your luggage onto their shoulders and carry you down the interstate.""

My leader threw her hands up in shock, then waved at me as if banishing me to another dimension, then turned and rushed away as fast as her heels would carry her before she heard more. 

The guest, of course, was completely confused and I explained that it was a little joke, since I couldn't predict what would happen so far in the future.

Winter and heating calls for entitlement...,"So got another one for the self entitled, council housed tw**s, who want everything at the click of their fingers at 10pm on a Sunday night. 

Female calls in. Has called British Gas to her house as her boiler is not working. British Gas informs her that the problem is her boiler, which has a low pressure and not the gas supply. As the property belongs to the council, British Gas is not allowed to touch the boiler and they honestly don’t care. 

I go through our standard questions, such as whether anyone has any covid symptoms, and whether there are any medical requirements and any children under 6 months old. We also have to ask about back up heating and hot water. 

The caller informs me that she has no back ups for heating but has an electric shower. She also has a 1 year old in the house, no medicals/disabilities. 

As we are an out of hours service, we have to call our on call manager who says yes or no to a repair. As it’s late and the caller doesn’t fit into our vulnerability group, he says no. Pretty standard at 10pm on a Sunday. We only have 1 engineer and we really have to prioritise those that really need it.

She states she will make a complaint. I’m guessing that was to make me scared, and maybe it will twist my arm to change the decision, but guess what, don’t give a single f**k. I still book her in for a repair to the boiler but she just has to wait til the next working day which is less than 12 hours away from the point when she called.

She ends the call with a “thanks for nothing” because I’m the big bad gal making her wait for 12 hours until an engineer can come fix her heating. Cause it’s “freezing cold and they are freezing to death!”, it really isn’t, it’s quite a mild night tonight.

Female calls in. Has called British Gas to her house as her boiler is not working. British Gas informs her that the problem is her boiler, which has a low pressure and not the gas supply. As the property belongs to the council, British Gas is not allowed to touch the boiler and they honestly don’t care. 

I go through our standard questions, such as whether anyone has any covid symptoms, and whether there are any medical requirements and any children under 6 months old. We also have to ask about back up heating and hot water. 

The caller informs me that she has no back ups for heating but has an electric shower. She also has a 1 year old in the house, no medicals/disabilities. 

As we are an out of hours service, we have to call our on call manager who says yes or no to a repair. As it’s late and the caller doesn’t fit into our vulnerability group, he says no. Pretty standard at 10pm on a Sunday. We only have 1 engineer and we really have to prioritise those that really need it.

How to be lazy through mathematics.,"Please do not use this story elsewhere. Hope you enjoy!

These days I'm a math tutor, and when my kids ask how ""real world situations"" are ever solved with math like in their textbook problems, I bring up this story.

The Theme Park Company I worked for had a lot of metrics we had to follow that ranged from bonkers to stupid, but one of the more lenient ones was the ""Sign In"" metric.

In short, they acknowledged that we couldn't be on the phone literally every minute of the day. Sometimes a call ran over, sometimes there were technical issues, sometimes people needed an extra potty break, or a trip to the water cooler, etc. (Team meetings, time with our team leaders, official breaks etc didn't count). So the company had a little line on our dashboard that showed how many hours we were scheduled vs how many we were on the phones, and calculated the percentage. So long as the line read 95% or higher, no red flags.

Seems like a lot, right? No real time for any extra breaks, maybe a minute here and there.

Except......math time!

On average in a month, I worked about 200 hours, doing 10 hour shifts 4 - 5 days per week. Know what 95% of 200 is? 10! A whole 10 hour shift! I literally could not take a single call on the last day of the month and STILL be at 95% sign in. And if I worked a lot of OT, I could do more!

As soon as I realized this, the last day of the month became my favorite day. I still had to show up, sign in and take one or two calls, just so no one wondered why I wasn't on at all. But in between that? I read a book, sat in the break room watching tv and played on my laptop all day.

A few people started asking how I was goofing off so much. I told them I had some extra time to burn off my sign in. They were shocked to realize how much free time they had. The next month I had a few people asking me to look at their dashboard and calculate their ""sign in surplus."" Another month after that, almost two dozen people had me helping to calculate their numbers. I had almost two teams worth of people de-stressing on the last day of the month instead of worrying about their metrics.

We all got a day off if we wanted it, we didn't have to worry about metric issues and we got to skip the last day of a month, which wasn't usually good for sales (or could hurt your average and therefore commission if you got a bunch of small calls) without muss or fuss. This technically also left any good sales to junior employees who weren't read for this kind of setback.

Math you guys. It really pays off!

Guy tried to pull a fast one on us,"I posted this about a year ago in another sub but it never got approved I guess? I figured I'd share with you. I work in emergency roadside assistance (ERS). There are many situations that we don't cover. Also, I had posted this the day it happened and just copy and pasted from the old post so while I did my best to update the text, if I mention something about it happening today or yesterday, I just forgot to change it.

One situation we can't tow you is if your registration/tag/plates are expired. Well we had a member, about a year ago, that called for service and when the driver got there the tags had expired in July of 2010. So, the driver told the member we couldn't tow it and left. (Customer was at his house btw so not in a dangerous situation) Well I got a call from the garage (We call tow companies garages) about a call on their board. It was this member again. He had placed another call through. And also the tow destination was going to a storage facility which we dont tow to because that usually means the member is just going to store their vehicle and doesn't want to have to pay for a tow truck so calls us.

Well I called this member and ask about the tags. He said that he told the driver that he had the tags and he just had to get them from his house and they're on the vehicle now. I then told him that we can't tow to storage facilities. The guy gets a little huffy and says that it's going to a repair shop that is behind the storage facility and storage place is the only building with an address. Okay fine. I tell him that we'll tow it but the driver isnt going anywhere within the storage property and will only drop the vehicle in the repair shops lot and not outside the gates of the storage facility like he had suggested.

So I call the garage back to give them the go ahead and they say that the guy had 2 different plates for the vehicle and isnt that illegal? What?? They didn't say anything about that the first time. So I call the member back AGAIN and say ""Oh and I forgot to mention, but when the driver arrives you'll need to show him the registration for the vehicle."" This is so we can match it with the VIN on the car and verify the tags are the legal tags and not tags he took off of some other vehicle.

Well this guy gets upset and starts rambling on about how he's been a member for 12 years and he's never had this much trouble ect, ect. Then he goes on to say that while he was putting the tags on, he fell and broke his hip and is waiting for an ambulance because of us and is probably going to cancel his membership. Ummm what??

First, Ive never broken a hip before but I know people that have and it's painful. He said it so matter factly and didn't sound to be in any pain. He said it in a way that made me think he thought that I would suddenly want to do damage control and say nevermind to the registration. And he made it seem like the ambulance wasn't coming right away. Overall he was just being a total jerk and I was certain he was lying but couldn't call him out on it.

So anyway I hang up with him and call the garage back and tell them what he said about how he supposedly broke his hip, is waiting for an ambulance and will have the registration. So less than an hour goes by and my coworker tells me that the garage is on the phone and wants to talk to me personally. Turns out the same driver that went there before gets to location again and the member pulls up and gives him the registration....for the vehicle he just drove there in. So the driver goes over to the vehicle needing towed and compares VINs (He did this just to cover his butt) and sure enough they dont match. So he left and called his dispatcher who then called me to let me know.

So I call the member one last time and let him know that because the registration didnt match, he's not getting towed. Well he was not happy and started bitching again about how he doesn't care what we say, we towed his $60,000 vehicle to a storage facility in the past so he doesnt understand why it's suddenly a problem (so basically he just admitted he was planning on storing the vehicle) and how he's gonna cancel his membership and he broke his hip (he didnt. The driver said that it did look like he fell and he had a scraped elbow but was walking around just fine) and finished up by saying he doesnt want anyone calling him anymore.

Lady threatens a driver but then says she didn't because the gun was registered to her,"Sorry for posting back to back to back but I like sharing my experiences with others that have an idea of what it's like to deal with similar situations. 

Anyways, I don't know why but I randomly remembered a call I had gotten late last year. I work in ERS as a dispatcher so I talk to the garages a lot. Well the one day, the garage called in and advised that their driver went to this members house to tow her vehicle but she ended up threatening him with a gun so he called the police and had to file a report and everything. The reason she threated the driver? He wouldn't tow her vehicle because the tags had expired about a year ago which means it's not a covered tow. 

Well after the police and driver had left, the member calls back and places another call but requests another garage. We find out it's the same lady and call her to tell her that she wasn't getting service because:

A. Her tags are expired

B. She threatened the driver with a gun. 

Her response? I didn't threaten anyone. All I told him, was that if he touched my vehicle, I was going to shoot him. Which is my right because the gun is registered to me. 

Pretty sure my brain short circuited after that. I had to explain to her that YES that is a threat and it doesn't matter if her gun is registered. All that means is that she can't get into trouble for having the gun.

C: no I wanted an immediate payout figure. 

Me: I have records here if you require of your messages to me, they specifically request the payout as at on 30/10/2020. I also gave you a payout figure for the immediate payout figure.

C: you should've used common sense and known I wanted to pay it out immediately! 

Me: I gave you the payout figure for immediate payout as well (I then read word for word my entire email to her).

C: you should've used common sense and known I wanted to pay it out immediately! 

Me: I gave you the payout figure for immediate payout as well (I then read word for word my entire email to her). 

C: well now I'm getting charged more because you didn't use common sense!

Me: as I said, I gave you the information you requested, you're welcome to make another payment and clear the account or it will direct debit on 15/10/2020 and close your account. 

C: well now I pay an extra fee regardless. 

Me: yes

(Customer ends call). 

I'm fortunate enough that my boss understands sometimes we need to be blunt with some customers. 

My boss let me heard a recording of an escalated call where he used the phrase ""it's 2020 Margaret, not everything is bloody pen and paper!"" When the customer claimed she couldn't physically SEE her documents as they were online."
The Day I Learned what Hell was Like,"Fair warning: this is long. I need you to understand my torture.   
Please don't use this elsewhere.

It started just the same as any other day. I arrived at \[Popular Theme Park\]'s call center, punched in and checked my emails. Everything seemed calm with the usual over-the-cubicle conversations happening before we opened. None of us knew what was in store. If we had suspected, perhaps we could've escaped in time.

One by one it took us. The glitch. Unbeknownst to us, there was a major flaw in our online booking system that day, and people's information was being messed up on their flight reservations. The one thing that we absolutely needed to be correct, because we couldn't fix it. Not only could we not fix it, but our general Guest Services department couldn't fix it either. Only a special section of Guest Services, Flight Services, had the ability to change anything. They were a secretive group, cloistered away in a corner room of the center, performing the sacred rituals of their tribe that only they knew about, to persuade the Airport Gods to bequeath us a change on a computer screen. 

The calls began pouring in. Dozens of agents hearing the same complaint. ""My flight information is wrong!"" This wasn't the usual ""you spelled my child's name wrong on the form only I filled out!"" This was on us and it was all kinds of messed up. 

Suddenly, several dozen call center reps were dialing the same extension, jockeying to get ahold of four Flight Service reps. Queues started to build. Not only were we waiting, but we had dozens upon dozens of people waiting for us so they could hear us say ""please hold.""

But it got worse....

Flight services' computers that communicated with the airlines were down. They had to put us on hold and call everything in manually, which meant they were on hold as well, waiting for the airlines, while we waited for them and guests waited for us, compounding the problem.

But it got worse.....

Aside from the stress of seeing the call queue hit triple digits (usually a problem reserved for peak holiday time), we couldn't just put our headsets down and sit back. We had to sit and listen to the hold music and be ready for when the service rep picked up. One person made the mistake and was hung up on and had to start again. Our company used music from its theme parks and movies and other pop music projects, so that was in our ear nonstop while we waited.

But it got worse.....

The hold music system was glitching. We would hear the ""beginning"" of the track and the opening song. A jaunty tune that was meant to get you happy. It lasted only twenty seconds before going into a pop song. A pop song the company had sent into ""way overplayed"" status long before this. It would get about 80% of the way through the song, then suddenly stop, making my OCD alarms go off like mad. Then the track would start again. And again. And again. And again, always resetting about 80% of the way through a song I absolutely hated. 

But it got worse.....

Flight services picked up after two hours and informed me they'd have to put me on hold to call in the change. Cue the queue! The music came back.....for another hour....

I was now over three hours into my shift. I was still on my first call. My head was spinning. The bouncy pop song was permeating my brain. At that point, I would have gladly ripped my headset from the computer. 

But it got worse.....

You mustn't let the customer think you forgot about them! The entire time, I had to check back in with the guest every few minutes to tell them I was still waiting, and hear how frustrated they were, and to find out they too were being driven crazy by the hold music, and when we were done they wanted to speak to my supervisor to complain about this. Joy.

Almost three and a half hours into the call, it was resolved. The guest was relieved, and in the end understood were having computer trouble and didn't complain about me, especially when they found out I had to listen to the same half-loop of music. I told them to have a great day and we looked forward to seeing them. I made my notes and signed off on the call.

And then the second call came in...same as the first. I worked thirteen hours that day, trying to help clear the queue, only took eight calls and made no sales. The only silver lining was that seven hours into it, I took lunch and the company began routing the issue calls to a group that would do call backs. 

On the bright side, the bar near us made a lot of money off of us that night.

Entitled member doesn't understand why we won't act like a taxi cab for her,"I work in emergency roadside assistance. We get A LOT of entitled people but this lady was by far the most entitled I feel. 

This member called in earlier today and ended up getting transferred to my supervisor (sup) because she wasn't happy that we were telling her, her request wasn't covered. The lady wanted our driver to pick up her and her husband, along with their dogs and tow the vehicle to the repair shop. She then wanted the driver to wait while the shop looked at the veh to see if they could fix it or not. 

If they couldn't she wanted the driver to then tow them to the airport so they could get a rental and WAIT while they unloaded the vehicle and then tow the vehicle to a tow dest 2 states away. Obviously, this is NOT covered. The drivers are not taxi cabs and we have other members waiting for service so we can't have a driver tied up for so long. 

My sup told her that we can tow it to the repair shop and she could go with it but that we would not be waiting for the shop to look at it and she would have to fine her own ride to the airport. The member kept arguing with her about it, saying we were leaving her stranded. They kept going back and forth until finally she hung on my supervisor. 

So some time goes by and she calls back for an eta. At this point we were still trying to find a garage to assist. We would have had a garage but it turns out that the member wanted papers from the driver that would be towing their vehicle stating that they don't have covid. This is not something we provide.

call transfer trouble leads to me getting a warning for possible swatting,"so this might an odd case since i dont work in the call center world, BUT this story is from someone reaching CS customer and somehow got routed to me, a human resource front desk receptionist. I tried my best to help and maybe you folks who deal with weird situations might be able to appreciate this tale.

feel free to remove if it is not appropriate. 

On the mobile, this is my first post here, please be gentle! im normally a lurker, but this was just too funny to not share. Hopefully some of you enjoy the read. Apologies, im a former journalist so I think this will turn out long.  Also, this ACTUALLY HAPPENED TODAY. I'll add tldr at the bottom.   

I'm one of those people who can't seem to get any kind of technology working properly for me. sometimes its a harmless accidental butt dials, other times I'll mistakenly click on my work address while ordering takeout for home. its always something. whatever nbd right?


  So the job i have right now is sort of a HR type of role with some receptionist duties inside a massive fulfillment center (aka a warehouse).   sometimes customer service gets super backed up (a lot of older folks like to call our 1-800 number to place orders ) and somehow when they are waiting too long on hold the call will ring and ring and eventually get transferred to my desk. today the phones were just ringing off the hook all day. I typically get one of these calls a week. today there were at least 6 or 7.

 I love being to help people, but when older generations call a wrong number they take FOREVER to grab a pen and paper. then you have to almost yell so they can hear the number I'm reading off. (that sometimes rings true for people of all ages.. remember I'm in a warehouse so the machines are pretty loud and it drowns out a lot of noise, making it hard for callers and myself to hear one another)  


so my tum tum is ready for lunch and im just about ready to step out for a short break when the phone rings one last time..   


so old dude (OD) says he would like to place an order. convo goes something like this:  

Me: hi, thanks for calling blah blah, can I help you? 

 OD: yeah I'm interested in ordering some food for my cat. 

 (sidebar: I think it's the sweetest thing in the world how old people will literally ride through the gates of hell and back just to ensure their pet has the exact right food.)  

Me: ahh sorry I am unable to help you this that. you've reached a warehouse HR department.  

 OD: you're kidding? I was so happy to finally be off hold.  

Me: yeah sorry I literally have nothing to do with the ordering process, but hang on i think I might be able to transfer you to the correct line. hang on a sec..  so I press the transfer button. next I have to hit the 9 button and then the 1 button before I can dial out. then I just enter the 1-800 number, and then the transfer button. easy enough right?  

yeah.. no. 

maybe you see where this is going..  i tried transferring OD a couple of times, but a random error message kept popping up and it will NOT let me forward the call.  

 OD was super patient with me thank God.  I'm REALLY annoyed at this point. All I want is to grab a snack and sit outside for a little bit. only thing standing in my way is this stupid phone call.   

exasperated i asked him to grab a pen and paper bc this was not working for me. 

I wait for him to grab his pen and paper, then I rattle off the phone number for him. he repeats it back wrong.. I correct him.. he repeats it back again, correct him some more. lol I can only laugh about this to keep myself from hanging up on the poor guy.

finally the call ends, just as I make my way outside for my break I see a police cruiser pull up front, block a few parking spots, and quickly exit the vehicle, taking a brisk walk to the vestibule area at the main entrance. 

since no one was watching reception desk I poked my head in and asked if the officer needed anything.

officer: actually yes. emergency dispatch had a handful of hang up calls, do you know if someone used the phones to call the police?

just then I clicks in my head that I majorly effed up. 

you see, when I was trying to transfer the old man to customer service I was dialing 9-1 and then the 1-800 number. 

the phone only registered the part where I dialed 9-1-1. (emergency number for those not in the states) 

and they got several hang ups bc I tried transferring the call a couple of times. 

in that moment while I realized that, my face turned sooo red, and my eyes got super wide. I came clean and the officer thought it was kind of funny. but I was warned. if it happens again I could face a fine or maybe even jail time for swatting. (not sure if thats true or what, but I do not intend to find out.) 

during this quick conversation, the bell rang for shift change.. and hundreds of people filed out of the warehouse and into the parking lot where they saw me talking to a cop. 

it was like being in high school and hearing the principal call you to the office. everyone's going ""uh ohhhhh what did you do now? 

i.was.mortified. 


at least I learned my lesson, and im never going to make that mistake ever again!

I don’t give out my information!!!,"*EDIT* Thanks for the award! I hardly post on Reddit but this was my first award! I know they’re given out like candy nowadays but thank you nonetheless.



I work for customer service for a retail brand. We  service customers via live chat, so, a written channel.


I’m in leadership, so at times I’ll have to take over a chat if the customer becomes too escalated or just asks for a supervisor. 

So we have this lady chat in, simple problem simple fix. She was inquiring about her order not shipping out yet (after 2 days, this is normal) and requested a shipping refund. Easy right?


The issue was, we require customers to verify some information on the order to protect their data - this is industry standard as well. 


But, I ended up having to take over the chat because she would NOT verify ANY information. She would say things like “well, you have that info right in front of you” and “I don’t give out my information like that” and a bit of “this is discrimination against me, you just don’t want to refund the shipping!” 


She did give out her info when she placed the order, so this one was something I had never seen before. 


We go back and forth for about an hour and a half, to no avail. Bear in mind I was positive, reassured her that I’d be happy to take care of the shipping and offer her something else for her time, but we cannot do anything on the order if she won’t verify. I confirmed this with my manager and director, no actions can be taken. 


Anyway, she ends up disconnecting and calling in. She asks to speak to a supervisor. *Queue I AM the manager moment* 

Guess who takes the call? 

I’m pretty good at keeping my cool so I kept my tender voice and let her know I’m the one she spoke with on chat.


Didn’t like that - asks to speak with MY manager. 

Long story short, she cussed my manager out and requested that I be fired. I overheard a bit of this conversation and my manager broke down eventually because this lady was wreaking havoc on our service channels. 


She said “For what? Wanting to protect your privacy? Being incredibly nice to you over the course of 2 hours of you acting petulant? Doing the same thing that we ask all of our associates to do with every customer in order to protect data? Get over yourself lady.” *click*
(Managers are essentially permitted to fight fire with fire if somehow that call gets to them, since there are 4 other people it must go through beforehand.) 


She tries to chat back, I let my manager know, and we block her IP. She tries to call again, we block her number. This took place over a total of about 8 hours. 




Moral of the story, no matter how badly you WANT to help someone, they have to WANT to be helped by you. If you are simply doing your job and sticking to what you know is required to begin with, don’t feel bad with these kinds of people. 



The call center environment is widely noted as one of the most draining, but, it also matters how the company you work for treats the customers. That makes all the difference, because if customer consistently get poor service, they react by being shitty customers. We don’t get too many people like that because our service is top notch, but even so, it’s not as bad as everyone says. It’s just not a job for everyone.",527,0,0,"I don’t give out my information!!! *EDIT* Thanks for the award! I hardly post on Reddit but this was my first award!

So we have this lady chat in, simple problem simple fix. She was inquiring about her order not shipping out yet (after 2 days, this is normal) and requested a shipping refund. Easy right?


The issue was, we require customers to verify some information on the order to protect their data - this is industry standard as well. 


But, I ended up having to take over the chat because she would NOT verify ANY information. She would say things like “well, you have that info right in front of you” and “I don’t give out my information like that” and a bit of “this is discrimination against me, you just don’t want to refund the shipping!” 


She did give out her info when she placed the order, so this one was something I had never seen before. 


We go back and forth for about an hour and a half, to no avail. Bear in mind I was positive, reassured her that I’d be happy to take care of the shipping and offer her something else for her time, but we cannot do anything on the order if she won’t verify. I confirmed this with my manager and director, no actions can be taken. 


Anyway, she ends up disconnecting and calling in. She asks to speak to a supervisor. *Queue I AM the manager moment* 

Guess who takes the call? 

I’m pretty good at keeping my cool so I kept my tender voice and let her know I’m the one she spoke with on chat.


Didn’t like that - asks to speak with MY manager. 

Long story short, she cussed my manager out and requested that I be fired. I overheard a bit of this conversation and my manager broke down eventually because this lady was wreaking havoc on our service channels. 


She said “For what? Wanting to protect your privacy? Being incredibly nice to you over the course of 2 hours of you acting petulant? Doing the same thing that we ask all of our associates to do with every customer in order to protect data? Get over yourself lady.” *click*
(Managers are essentially permitted to fight fire with fire if somehow that call gets to them, since there are 4 other people it must go through beforehand.) 


She tries to chat back, I let my manager know, and we block her IP. She tries to call again, we block her number. This took place over a total of about 8 hours. 




Moral of the story, no matter how badly you WANT to help someone, they have to WANT to be helped by you. If you are simply doing your job and sticking to what you know is required to begin with, don’t feel bad with these kinds of people. 



The call center environment is widely noted as one of the most draining, but, it also matters how the company you work for treats the customers. That makes all the difference, because if customer consistently get poor service, they react by being shitty customers. We don’t get too many people like that because our service is top notch, but even so, it’s not as bad as everyone says. It’s just not a job for everyone."

For background, I currently work at a large bank and I have worked in various roles in Fraud, Credit Risk, Underwriting and Sales. This story comes from sales. My job was essentially filling out applications over the phone for the company's credit card. 


I was feeling pretty good. I was freshly caffeinated and had just started my first 3:00p-12:00a shift. Around 10:00p I got a call from a very sad-sounding gentleman who told me he needed a credit card to finance repairs to his motorcycle. We found him a good deal that'd work out for him where he wouldn't have any interest for roughly 18 months and he'd also get a decent amount of rewards out of it too. 


Over the course of the call, he opened up about how he bought the motorcycle after his wife had passed away from cancer. He said that they'd always talked about doing a cross country road trip since neither had left the state before.


He told me how he cared for the motorcycle like it was worth a million bucks and how he washed it every time he stopped in case his wife was watching down on him as he made his journey across the country. Eventually, the motorcycle broke down about 3/4 the way to his destination and he didn't have the cash to fix it. I asked him how much he needed and he said it'd roughly be about $1,500. 


I don't know much about motorcycles, but I tried to ask questions to keep the conversation going because you could hear in his voice that even just talking about it made him happy. Plus I had time to kill while we ran his credit. The dude could probably talk for hours about it if I let him.


The application came back approved, but only for $1,200. Not enough. Now, if a customer wasn't satisfied with that amount, we can do some math and possibly increase it a bit. I asked him again how much it'd be and he said ""Oh about $1,500, but a little more would be nice so I can have some wiggle room in case I need it.""


So I did that math, offered him $2,000 instead and he was ecstatic. He wanted to buy me a beer, so he asked if I was anywhere on his route to California. I was not, but I told him I'd treat myself to one tonight for him. He thanked me, I gave him his electronic account number and we ended the call (with a few ""Hell yeah""s from his end). I did have that beer and it was damn tasty.

A Long Shot and a Close Call,"Hello readers! Get comfy, this is a bit long.  
Please enjoy this story, but do not repost it elsewhere.

Many years ago after I got out of retail, I decided to move down south and work in the reservation center for a huge theme park. I became known among many of the managers there by my nickname, ""what did he do now?"" This is one of my favorite ""how are you not fired??"" stories.

Oh, also, we use fake names on the phones, but I'm going to use a faker fake name just to keep things anonymous. I'm a bit infamous there.

Our theme park had multiple resorts, each with a different theme. Some had normal rooms, some had ""villas"" (time-share, apartment-style accommodations) and some were more popular than others. One in particular was pretty much booked up all the time on our end because the time-share folks always got first dibs. Guess where this guest wanted to stay? Our scene begins after I've been there 8.5 hours into a 10 hour day. (I had a 4 on/3 off schedule, which I actually loved). I was a bit tired and not in the mood to suffer fools gladly.

Me: ""Thank you for calling \[Theme Park\] Travel Company, my name is Walter, how can I help you today?""

Guest: \*ugly-cry sobbing\* ""I...hello? Yes. Hi."" \*more sobbing\*

Me: (Inner voice: Oy.....great) ""Yes, ma'am? Can I help you? Are you all right?""

Guest: \*sniffle\* ""Yes....I'm sorry. I'm just so stressed about this. My mother-in-law decided to tell my family, in front of the kids, that she's taking us all to \[Theme Park\], and has now left it to me to book everything.""

Me: (Inner voice: Well...she's a witch with a capital B isn't she?) ""Well, nil desperandum, madam, we'll get you all set. Do you know what it is you're looking for?""

Guest: ""Yes...she wants to stay at the \[Way too popular resort to have openings\].""

My brain: Crap....

Guest: ""And she wants to stay in a 2-bedroom villa."" (The most popular)

My brain: Craaaaaaap....

Me: ""And when are you looking to come down?""

Guest: ""Two weeks from tomorrow.""

My brain: Time of death: 4:57pm.

Me: ""Okay well...I'm going to tell you now, this may take some doing, but let's see what we have. \*looks it up and gets the goose egg I knew I'd get.\* Ma'am, I'm sorry but it appears that resort is all booked up.

Guest: \*sobs and moans\*

Me: ""Okay now, hold tight. Let's play around a bit with this and see what we can do. Are we flexible on the dates at all?""

Guest: ""I...I don't think so. She already made me book the plane tickets. My mother in law is a VERY particular person. She wants things just so and she's VERY picky.""

Me: \*slams head on desk\* ""Well let's see what I can find.""

What followed was a thirty minute exercise in futility as I went through the few options I had, attempting to sell her on features, or on the villas but other resorts, or on any alternative, only to be met with, ""you don't understand! My mother in law is VERY PICKY about things! I'm sorry.""

I finally find her something I really thought would clinch it. I could get them two rooms at the regular hotel side of the resort they wanted, and they'd be on our ""Concierge Level"" (a VERY nice place I've stayed at. Easy to get spoiled). I get four words in and she turns it down when she hears it's not a villa.

Me: ""Ma'am...why is your mother in law so set on a villa?""

Guest: ""Because....it's just how she is. She wants her coffee /just so/. She wants her breakfast made in the morning, she wants to have a sitting area to relax in...""

Me: ""We have those things in other areas--.""

Guest: \*jabbers away\* ""....you just don't understand.""

And that's where I lost it. Cue the verbal cold water.

Me: ""No, no, ma'am. I understand. I just don't care.""

\*Dead silence\*

Me: (Taking advantage of her finally not blubbering) ""Ma'am, this is YOUR vacation too. Let's be real with each other. Who's going to be the one making her coffee, cooking her breakfast and cleaning up after her?""

Guest: ""Well...probably me...""

Me: ""Exactly. And how is that fair to you? Answer: It's not. You're doing the work here, you're the one in charge of this decision, and you are going to be the hero of this story. So, here's what you're going to do. You're going to take these two rooms. Then, you are going to sit back and relax in our private lounge, and WE will make the coffee however she wants it. WE will cook her breakfast, AND dinner! WE will provide free snacks, cookies, cordials and enough wine and spirits that after the first night, I promise you she will be too sloshed to give you any more grief for the rest of the trip.""

Guest: ""It...it comes with all that?""

Me: ""Yes, ma'am!""

Guest: ""Oh! Well...that's better isn't it?""

Me: ""YES!!! Oh, and by the way? It's about $2,000 less than what you would have paid for the villa, and since you said she's paying for it, you get to go be the rock star who saved her a ton of money. So what's her credit card number because at this point we both need to agree that I'm right, and we're doing this.""

After that she was all smiles, gave me the card number and we booked her deposit.

But what's the ""close call"" you ask?

It turns out that call was being observed. My team leader had been called into a conference room with all six Vice Presidents from my call center as well as our second call center, and they decided to listen to a call from her team to see how she was doing as a leader. Guess who they were listening to.

About fifteen minutes after the call ended, my leader (who was normally sweet as sugar) stormed to my cubicle and yanked me into her office. She told me what happened, and apparently when I said ""I just don't care"" all 6 VPs flipped out, pearls tightly clutched, and faces white. My leader had never seen them so terrified. I explained I had to stop her from freaking out. She goes, ""Yeah, NOT LIKE THAT! I want you to know, they said the ONLY reason you aren't fired is because she purchased and was happy in the end. Please don't ever scare me like that again!""

Thankfully this had a true happy ending. The family kept the reservation I suggested, had a great time, and the daughter-in-law wrote a long, very kind letter to the upper-ups, and my leader didn't get in trouble.

But I still giggle to myself picturing the VPs' faces.",46,0,0,"A Long Shot and a Close Call Hello readers! Get comfy, this is a bit long.

“I never answer those seriously!” You what?,"For some background I work in auto/cycle insurance. Now I’m not sure if this is usual or not but we don’t have a department or team who really handles issues with customer’s online accounts. So it’s up to us CSRs to try to handle all that.

Man calls in upset that he can’t get into his online accounts. I verify him and immediately pull up the very limited info I can see in regards to his account.

Me: Well, sir the account is set up completely. Have you tried resetting the password?

Caller: Well, yeah! That’s why I’m calling! I can’t do it!!

M: Really? All it should do is have you answer the security questions you chose and answered when setting up the account. Is it not allowing you to do that?

C: Oh those? I don’t remember my answers. I never take those seriously! They’re so stupid so sometimes I pick questions that don’t apply to me. Sometimes I answer them with the last word in the question. And sometimes I make up whatever answer I want!

At this point my head is in my hands. I cannot believe what I’m hearing and struggling to comprehend why anyone in their right mind would do this.

M: Well, sir, I apologize but at this point there’s nothing I can do. I advise that you make a new account under a different email address.

M: Sir, those security questions are there to help you get your account back. I don’t have access to those nor can I reset them.

We go back and forth for a bit with me having to reiterate that he essentially f*cked himself over in the sweetest and polite way possible. He eventually accepted defeat and hung up. 

TL;DR Man didn’t answer his security questions seriously and couldn’t get into his online account.

Now I’m not sure if this is usual or not but we don’t have a department or team who really handles issues with customer’s online accounts. So it’s up to us CSRs to try to handle all that.

Man calls in upset that he can’t get into his online accounts. I verify him and immediately pull up the very limited info I can see in regards to his account.

Me: Well, sir the account is set up completely. Have you tried resetting the password?

Caller: Well, yeah! That’s why I’m calling! I can’t do it!!

M: Really? All it should do is have you answer the security questions you chose and answered when setting up the account. Is it not allowing you to do that?

C: Oh those? I don’t remember my answers. I never take those seriously! They’re so stupid so sometimes I pick questions that don’t apply to me. Sometimes I answer them with the last word in the question. And sometimes I make up whatever answer I want!

At this point my head is in my hands. I cannot believe what I’m hearing and struggling to comprehend why anyone in their right mind would do this.

M: Well, sir, I apologize but at this point there’s nothing I can do. I advise that you make a new account under a different email address.

Client doesn't want to pay over phone.,"Please tell me if this doesn't belong here.

This isn't my story, it's my husband's but I think it fits here.

He is an insurance broker. Not sure if it means the same thing everywhere but basically he is the middle man between the insurance company and the client. He takes care of dealing with the insurance so the client gets taken care of.

There is this one client that *no one* wants. It gets passed around constantly. Now it was his turn.

It was renewal time and he has done his job in negotiating a new contract. The client was happy and it was time to pay. This is where the issues start.

The client is a woman and she asks my husband to go to her so he can tell her the details on person (even tho she had them in writing). My husband goes and all she does is ask him personal questions (how old, if he is married, what he studied, if he is looking for another job) which made him uncomfortable.

So a few days after that in person meeting they are back to phone calls. He tries to get her to pay by having her give him their details and she refuses. Says she doesn't feel comfortable giving that info over phone. Asks if someone can go in person and retrieve the money, of course this isn't possible. She then asks if she can call the insurance company directly and pay them, which she can.

Everyone thinks that's the end. But no. Because she still has to give her info by phone to the insurance company. And. She. Doesn't. Want. To.

So she calls my husband again and he just doesn't want to deal with her because she makes him uncomfortable so another coworker deals with her. They talk and talk and she refuses to give out the info.

Boss asks what is taking so long because this is weeks worth of calls. They explain that she is now asking if she can log in into her system so she can input her details herself. They are so tired of her that the boss agrees to her insane request.

So she logs in and pays and now they have to change their details do she can't log in ever again.

"These weeks Irate Callers, Sorted!","This week has been a stressful one. Is mercury in retrogade or something because LORD people have been acting crazy! These are the calls from this week, some mine, some coworkers: rated 5-thats messed up to 1-needed an extra offline break to reset my brain 

5. The Creep— This gentleman called and started giving me relaxation, breathing exercises and toe curling (?) techniques. Wouldn’t tell me what I could help him with, until I insisted FIRMLY. After helping him sort something in his account, he kept being all creepy. Followed by a “Thanks for the tips, I’m at work right now sk I’ll try those later. Thank you for calling X, you have a nice day. 

4-4. The Quadruple Dipper— This man called about 3-4 times, I know because when I said it in the company chat, other people came out and said they’d gotten him before me. He proceeded to say I was stupid and an idiot repeatedly right after my greeting.  Did I mispronounce something? I dont think so? Every question was answered with how much of an idiot I was and how I was stupid. Simply said my closings, and hung up. 

3-3. The Banshee’s Cousin— This lady called in and once asked to confirm her address, freaked out. A name and an account number does not cut it, since we send out a card that contain both, anyone could find the card, call in and pretend they’re the customer. So she began saying “Why are you asking me that? You have it in front of you?!” In a shrieking, almost deafening tone. To which my reply always remained more or less the same “It’s part of my job to confirm your address, the account number is not personal information, therefore it cannot be used to confirm your identity”. At one point, she paused, and I spoke, answering to her question, but apparently she wasn’t done, and when she started speaking again, the words had already left my mouth. This set her off even more: “WHY ARE YOU TALKING OVER ME?” To which my response is the truth “I apologize ma’am. Our phones lag sometimes and-“ “WELL WE PAY YOU ENOUGH TO GET BETTER PHONES!” This carried on and when she noticed I was not giving in, she proceeded to what I can only describe as putting the phone down and ignoring me? I said “Ma’am” multiple times in an effort to try and salvage the call, which ended in me stating That I was going to terminate the call, since I could not hear anyone on the other side, I had to still say my closing, but she grabbed the phone and clicked it off.  Can’t say I was mad she hung up. 

2-2. The Banshee— This lady called to state we were going to stop sending her so much mail. Of course I can help! I have a way of-NO MORE MAIL. Oh shit what happened there? Oh yes. She interrupted me. Just like that. I proceded to let her know that I had a way of making her receive just one letter-Aaaaand cut off again. “YES. JUST ONE LETTER”-she shrieked. I responded by saying “Ma’am, I need to read you this statement about how this is going to work.”  To which she said “Go ahead.” So I proceed to explain it once again: one letter when your account will expire, and if you have an email- “NOPE. NO EMAILS JUST A LETTER. ARE YOU CONFUSED OR SOMETHING?” This time I proceed to finish my statement-“an email will be sent as well, if the account expires, we will send a letter a month letter to let you know.”  She kept shrieking in what I can only assume was the Karen-est voice I have ever heard “I don’t care. You WILL stop sending me mail. YOU are GOING TO DO THAT AND I AM HANGING UP NOW.” I started another statement about how if she hangs up, I cant make any changes to her account beca-click. Oh, she hung up. Well, I can’t make changes in any account without the caller on the line. So guess who’s still receiving mail?

1-1. The Short Fuse— this man? Calls in, right after my greeting, starts asking me?/stating: “Are your agents-if your agents-I have been hung up on now TWICE, IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE TRAINED TO DO?!” I apologize, and offer my help, once again “I am so sorry sir, how can I help?” He’s not having it! “THIS IS THE SECOND TIME YOU ASK ME THAT AND YOU HAVE TO ANSWER MY QUESTION! Is that what you do?!” At this point he was yelling at the top of his lungs, and my hands were shaking uncontrollably. I let out a sigh, whithout noticing I hadn’t muted my mic, which meant...he’d heard me sigh into the mic. “WHAT WAS THAT? WHAT WAS THAT NOISE YOU JUST MADE?!....” he’s still screaming for a good 45 seconds straight after I muted myself to tell my Sup I was hanging up and gather their phone number to get them blacklisted. When I came back, He had finally shut up and was waiting a response from me from a “ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME OR NOT”, I unmute myself and barely get to say “Sir..” before he bursts out into yelling again, at this point I’m not even hearing words, so I state “Sir, In order for me to assist you I need for you to lower your voice and keep the conversation professional”, he never stopped yelling. I could HEAR the vein in his forehead about to pop. So I said my closing statement, and stated I was ending the call. Apparently, he HAD been hung up on before, because he kept yelling at other representatives and not let them try to assist. 

I ask myself every day, do these people understand that, we WILL keep dropping their calls, they wil NEVER get help or sort their problems out if they keep abusing the representatives? If you don’t corroborate your info, we can’t help, if you verbally abuse us, we WILL NOT help, and no matter how many times you call, you WILL be dropped. And eventually, your phone number will be sent to the Big Dick Bosses to blacklist. And then you will lose the service you liked, because you decided to be a raging pos. :) so Thank you for calling, and have a nice day, asshole.

But there was a block on the account that needed to be removed first.the fraud rep had a sassy rude like voice towards me and me alone and made me seem like a dumbass on the call with the customer on too. Good thing the calls are recorded and monitored. I reported her attitude to my supervisor. Yes i know i should have gotten more information thats my bad i will own my mistake. But will this easily be turned against me? I never went through this process. I just need advice and your positive opinions on this. This is my first job ever and i love it!

In which Mr. Customer got catfished... by a psychic,"More tales from the psychic line! 

One fine summer day, I take a call from a very angry customer. He’s been chatting for a long time with one of our psychics... and not on our line. He’s been a very bad boy, and now he’s mad because Psychic Mary confessed that she’s really Psychic Mark. 

“I told her things about me that I’ve never told anyone else and then she tells me she’s really a man!” he laments as I try not to cackle in his ear. Who uses a psychic hotline as a dating service?

“We had really intimate conversations!”

Now, this is obviously against the rules, as phone sex wasn’t the goal of that side of the business (like it was on the other), but it’s also not allowed for the customer and psychic to trade personal information for obvious reasons. So many rip off artists out there, and we had our share of them - some of which I’ll share sooner or later. 

“She always sounded so hot!” he says with an obvious pout. 

So I let him know we’ll get our “fraud team” on it, which was really just a small handful of guys who handled the IT for the operation. 

He then demands we reimburse him “for false advertising”, which I had to mute him and laugh about. Once composed, I let him know that his decision to speak to Psychic Mary on his own time is not the responsibility of the company and is absolutely against our guidelines, as is phone sex with the psychic. He demands the refund of his last two legit calls. I deny him, as does a supervisor, and tell him I’ll send the request on to the fraud team. 

He calls me a few names, says he’ll trash our reputation to everyone (because a psychic hotline is such a classy, respectable business anyway), and he’ll never be a customer again. 

I could end it there, it’s funny enough, but I can’t do that to y’all when I know there’s a cherry to be put on top of this hot mess sundae. 

A few days later, one of the IT guys comes up to me laughing. He proceeds to tell me that they suspended Psychic Mary’s access to the line. She finally called in to see why she couldn’t get any customers. 

He says, “Well, is this Psychic Mary or is this Psychic Mark?”

She hung up and was never heard from again.",80,0,0,"In which Mr. Customer got catfished... by a psychic More tales from the psychic line! 

One fine summer day, I take a call from a very angry customer. He’s been chatting for a long time with one of our psychics... and not on our line. He’s been a very bad boy, and now he’s mad because Psychic Mary confessed that she’s really Psychic Mark. 

“I told her things about me that I’ve never told anyone else and then she tells me she’s really a man!” he laments as I try not to cackle in his ear. Who uses a psychic hotline as a dating service?

“We had really intimate conversations!”

Now, this is obviously against the rules, as phone sex wasn’t the goal of that side of the business (like it was on the other), but it’s also not allowed for the customer and psychic to trade personal information for obvious reasons. So many rip off artists out there, and we had our share of them - some of which I’ll share sooner or later. 

“She always sounded so hot!” he says with an obvious pout. 

So I let him know we’ll get our “fraud team” on it, which was really just a small handful of guys who handled the IT for the operation. 

He then demands we reimburse him “for false advertising”, which I had to mute him and laugh about. Once composed, I let him know that his decision to speak to Psychic Mary on his own time is not the responsibility of the company and is absolutely against our guidelines, as is phone sex with the psychic. He demands the refund of his last two legit calls. I deny him, as does a supervisor, and tell him I’ll send the request on to the fraud team. 

He calls me a few names, says he’ll trash our reputation to everyone (because a psychic hotline is such a classy, respectable business anyway), and he’ll never be a customer again. 

I could end it there, it’s funny enough, but I can’t do that to y’all when I know there’s a cherry to be put on top of this hot mess sundae. 

A few days later, one of the IT guys comes up to me laughing. He proceeds to tell me that they suspended Psychic Mary’s access to the line. She finally called in to see why she couldn’t get any customers. 

He says, “Well, is this Psychic Mary or is this Psychic Mark?”

She hung up and was never heard from again."
Enter Key,"Alright short and simple...

My first Saturday working in a small internet service provider call center I was there by myself, I was super nervous since I was by myself for the first one in the history of that job.

I get them to open a web page, and am trying to get them to our website so I can do a remote assistance and....... It took me 20 minutes to explain where the ""enter"" key is on their keyboard.

"This is our worst Karen. There are many like her, but this one is ours.","Every company probably has that ONE customer. The one that collectively gets on everyone's nerves, no matter which department. 

Well, Karen is ours. 

Now, we have plenty of Karens, don't get me wrong. But this Karen is the Karenest of all the Karens.

* When Karen calls in, she is most of the time already at 70 and can go to 100 at a moment's notice. Simply asking her questions to help better understand her issue or request will set this bitch off. 
* Has anyone here watched The Good Place? She's Elanor Shellstrop, pre-character development. Maybe worse.
* In my years of customer service, I have never put a client on hold without telling them I'm about to do so. Not one. Except her. The first time was an accident because it was the first time I'd spoken to her, and she went from speaking in a somewhat rushed but civil tone to SUDDENLY SCREAMING AND CURSING within a hundredth of a second. Scared the bejesus out of me and my hand slipped. Second time she pulled that shit, I put her on hold right as she started screeching.
* If you don't understand her issue, question, or who she needs to speak to by the first words that come out of her mouth, she's already insulting your intelligence and telling you you don't know what you're talking about, or just screaming at you suddenly with no warning or provocation.
* The woman has a bunch of escalations to managers because whenever she's in a mood (which is 98% of the time), she is nigh impossible to work with and just seems like she'd rather bitch and complain and tell you you don't know anything rather than just calm the fuck down and explain. 
* The other 2% of the time.....she's actually in a civil mood. I don't know what it is, but there's been a FEW calls people have had where Karen is actually not acting like you're the slave who's failed her and she's mad that state laws prevent her from having you flogged. We just assume she took her meds that day.
* She's one of those who demands a call for *everything* to the point where it defies logic. Sure, we're happy to give you a call, but if you aren't there, we're leaving a voicemail and following up via email. This woman will demand a call, not pick up the phone, and then call into the main line hours later ready to slit throats because someone dared send her an email to try and see when she'd be available. 

Nearly everyone in the company hates her because she treats everyone like garbage, but none of the higher ups will take action against her because she technically hasn't insulted people *directly,* or used abusive language *directed* at us. 

She's apparently allowed to be a screaming, difficult asshole as long as she's not directing abuse at the person on the phone....though, our definitions of ""abusive"" seem to be a bit skewed in my opinion. Our immediate managers are actually on our side with this one just based on how she treats people and how many pointless escalations she gets in, but at this point, my bitter mind is assuming she's blowing the higher ups in charge of actually doling out punishments to the clients who go too far.

The Tale Of Ms. K.......AKA How To Make Everyone You Speak With Hate You.,"Let me tell you a story of Ms. K. I am not using her full name, although I could for reasons that I'll explain later.  This took place a few years ago. 

Let me give you some context. 

I work at an online bank in the Technical Department (which means I deal with old people all day long that don't know the difference between a search engine and a browser). I also help out our Core team, which is the general help line for people who just have questions for us. No big deal, right? 

Nope. 

We had a caller that for the sake of anonymity we will call Ms. K. Now Ms. K was one of those customers that made everyone she talked to angry, and I do mean everyone. We even started an office wide joke about her whenever someone had the displeasure of getting her. 

So what made her so bad? 

In a typical work day, a banker would talk to between 25 and 50 people, and most people would call in once or twice in order to get an issue fixed. 

Not Ms. K. She would call in between 2 and 12 times A DAY (Her record was 16 times in one day). She would always ask the exact same question to us, and we would give her the exact same story that the other people gave her. When she said that we were wrong, she would hang up, and call back later to ask the same question. Every. Single. Day. 

The other problem was that she had been with our company since 2013, and it only got really bad at the end of 2016. She would make hundreds of calls a year to ask us the exact same question. 

The question she wanted to know was when her bank statement would come in. Now keep in mind that we had monthly statements that was sent out to everybody, she never knew what month of the statement that she wanted, and when would tell her that a copy was already sent out, she would tell at us that we didn't because she never received it, and hang up. 

The other huge issue we had with her was she was elderly, super confrontational to the point of it almost seeming like a joke, racist to certain members of the bank, and she most likely had dementia. The reason I say that is when she would call back, she claimed to have no memory of any of the calls she made that day, or any days previous. Whenever we would tell her that she already called in 15 minutes ago to ask us for a copy of her bank statement, she would deny ever talking to us, get mad and yell at us, and hang up again. It got to be so bad that the team that was responsible for sending out letters refused to send any to her because she would ask for several of the same form every day. 

You can see why nobody liked dealing with her, but after what felt like an eternity dealing with this woman, something incredible happened. 

She stopped calling. 

It happened out of nowhere. One day she was yelling at us, the next day not a peep from her. It was heaven. The next day she didn't call in, and the day after that, and the day after that, and on and on. We didn't hear from her for over 8 months. Some had forgot about her, some thought she was moved into a home away from a phone, and some thought she died. As for me, I was just happy to not deal with her. 

She called two more times after 8 months of no contact, and I was so shocked to hear her voice I almost fell out of my chair. After those two calls, she never called us back. That was back in 2018, and in a strange way, I almost miss it a bit. At least she was consistent.

Call center nurses have a warped sense of humor.,I was working for a health system nurse advice line (think Dial-a-Nurse) as a RN. There were about 30 nurses on staff but at that time I was the only male. Most of the nurses were older and well experienced and most of us had worked in Emergency Rooms. At any given time there would be 6 to 8 of us on duty and answering the calls. Please understand that nurses in general and especially ER nurses tend to develop a weird sense of humor. It helps them to handle the stresses of literally dealing with life and death situations on a daily basis. I had taken medical leave to have prostate surgery which was followed by complications causing me to miss close to a month of work. All of my co-workers knew why I had been gone. As I walked into the call center I was warmly greeted with a question of “Hey man. What’s up?” which was a barely disguised double entendre.

Put me through to one of your female colleagues!,"So... I just returned from a year of paternity leave (possible if still a bit rare in my country) and was back working for a tech support hotline, when the phone rang.

Me: Hello, JimLongbow speaking, how can I help you?

To which a middle-aged female voice said:  ""Put me through to one of your female colleagues. ""

I was taken a little aback but took a page out of the manual from said female colleagues, who were sitting right next to my desk. We were all really annoyed by those sexist calls - even if they are usually in the other direction and always find a way to pay back the customer, if not in this call, then the next.

Me: ""I'm sorry, they are currently not available (a lie), but please describe the technical issue and maybe I can help you. For that , please give me your company name and your name, please."" In the sweetest, most inoffensive voice I could muster.

Her: ""hrmpf OK."" 

She then starts rattling down her company name, her name and the problem and I dutifully typed it in.

And then it came:

Her:  You type pretty fast....**for a man**.

Oh how I've waited for a line like that.

Me: ""Why, thank you! But that's slow. I was a lot faster before my 12-month paternity leave"".

My colleagues, who were by then listening in to my half of the conversation, had to stifle a laugh.

But You. Could. Hear. A. Pin Drop. on the other side of the line (the sound her jaw made when it dropped to the floor was positively ear-shattering). A guy taking care of the kid did not fit into her view of the world at all!

Her: \[Stammering\] Uhm.. OK.. Congratulations then! 

And she suddenly was so much friendlier than before. 

The phone call wrapped up shortly after that. I gave her some first-aid tips based on the issue she described, asked for some files to be emailed to us and hung up.

Me: Hello, JimLongbow speaking, how can I help you?

To which a middle-aged female voice said:  ""Put me through to one of your female colleagues. ""

I was taken a little aback but took a page out of the manual from said female colleagues, who were sitting right next to my desk. We were all really annoyed by those sexist calls - even if they are usually in the other direction and always find a way to pay back the customer, if not in this call, then the next.

Me: ""I'm sorry, they are currently not available (a lie), but please describe the technical issue and maybe I can help you. For that , please give me your company name and your name, please."" In the sweetest, most inoffensive voice I could muster.

Her: ""hrmpf OK."" 

She then starts rattling down her company name, her name and the problem and I dutifully typed it in.

And then it came:

Her:  You type pretty fast....**for a man**.

Oh how I've waited for a line like that.

Me: ""Why, thank you! But that's slow. I was a lot faster before my 12-month paternity leave"".

My colleagues, who were by then listening in to my half of the conversation, had to stifle a laugh.

But You. Could. Hear. A. Pin Drop. on the other side of the line (the sound her jaw made when it dropped to the floor was positively ear-shattering). A guy taking care of the kid did not fit into her view of the world at all!

Her: \[Stammering\] Uhm.. OK.. Congratulations then! 

And she suddenly was so much friendlier than before. 

The phone call wrapped up shortly after that. I gave her some first-aid tips based on the issue she described, asked for some files to be emailed to us and hung up.  

I turned to my female colleagues and told them, that  now, for the first time ever, I really, really understand how annoying those calls can be (and then went to get myself a well-deserved coffee)!"
I want our phone working so people can still reach my dead husband. Can you waive it for free?,"Me = Me, of course lol

Cx = Customer (the wife)

Ret = Retentions Department

Bil = Billing Department

==================

Me: Hello, you're through to BEEP company. My name is ME. How may I help?

Cx: Oh, hi. I spoke with a gentleman yesterday about my account. I was asking for a discount so I can renew my phone but I haven't heard back yet. Can you check it for me?

Me: Sure thing. May I have your phone number or reference ID, please?

(Took a bit while to get her information. Turns out that she only has the billing statement. I got her account, no worries.)

Cx: So you see, I was billed for $20.00 for 1 year last year. My husband passed away (she started sobbing here) and money's a bit too tight due to COVID and stuff. I was hoping if you can offer me the same discount from the previous year so I wouldn't pay for $120 this year. I only want to keep our phone working so people can still reach my husband. It would be very nice if you waive it for free. Just for this year.

Me: My condolences, ma'am. I see there's a case opened for you and that it's being reviewed by Ret. You will hear from them once your request is processed.

Cx: Can't you do it from me? I mean, you do understand, right?

Me: I do. But I'm in no position decide for discounts as you've reached our general hotline. What I can do, however, is relay your information so maybe they can give you another exception as courtesy.

Cx: I appreciate that. (and then she goes again with the story and that she has no money)

Days later she calls again. She was offered for 10% discount as that's the best we can only give to our customers. Obviously, she declined and pleaded again to have the same discount or give it for free (like heck no lol)

I just serve as a messenger at this point but I was able to ask Bil to reactivate the line for 24 hours just for her. This went on for days and I'm going bananas. This woman is literally asking for something unreasonable.

Ret was eventually able to give the discount she asks but she calls again.

Cx: I'm calling in about the discount I asked for. I thought I will be given the service for free?

Me: Ma'am, if I'm not mistaken, you requested for a discount.

Cx: I did, but why can't you give it for free? My husband passed away, why can't you just give it to me? Just for this year. It's all I ask. (she starts to cry again from the background)

Me: I hope you also understand that we also need to cover the fees to keep the lines open. The discount we honored is the lowest we can apply so you can pay for your phone.

Cx: (she clicks her tongue out of dismay) Well, can you ask Ret if they can waive it for now? I just don't know when I'll be able to pay.

Me: I can request for a payment extension if that's what you need.

She eventually gives in and will be waiting for Ret's reply but I don't know.

Incompetence,"The title really says it all. 

Lady calls in, and isn't mad. Or angry. Just confused. And I get why, she was refunded a not so insubstantial amount and she still had a balance afterwards. 

And I know why. We  calculate interest on a per diem basis. This can save people money in the long run, but it also leads to fuckery where people pay off the balance and then get charged interest and don't realize they have it. I do my level best to ensure that anyone paying of their balance either accounts for said interest or at least is aware it'll pop up when the bill cycles over. 

This though, was special. On a payment plan, with payments all scheduled. She pays the balance off towards the end. She still has payments scheduled. Anyone with a quarter of a brain cell can figure out ""ah, yeah, we should cancel those"". Nah, that day, Fuckstick took the balance, and didn't cancel the payments. So she gets charged.

No big deal, we refund it. Except for the fact, per diem interest. She carried a balance for a few days. So, the day, the exact same fucking day, we refund the not canceled payment, and then put the interest on the account. I'm blown the fuck away. I'm apologizing. I'm just stunned at the chain of fuckery. I actually went stupid. 

I call the help desk. Shout out to the homie who picked up. He reminds me customer service can reverse interest charges if the bank is at fault. And we are. Call customer service. I explain. They say ""I'll get this fixed immediately"". Customer is happy. 

This should never have been an issue. But it was. Because people are dumb. I just needed to vent, sorry if this isn't all that entertaining.",46,0,0,"Incompetence The title really says it all.

Found out about the death of Eddie Van Halen by customer today.,"I was doing a bunch of research for old archived transactions, the kind of tedious stuff that takes time and concentration, then the customer just bursts out about his death.

The wife was respectful, she listened, confirmed transactions as genuine. I felt sorry for her. She told me she was buying items of the manufacturing business (electric drills etc). She passed the phone back to the customer.

*she provided the phone number and complained about the company scamming her out of $300.

Caller: I need to speak with a manager RIGHT NOW! 

Me: we’ll I’m sorry I wouldn’t be able to transfer calls since they are currently closed for the day. I would be more than happy to take a message so a rep can return your call first thing tomorrow.

Me: Oh I’m so sorry ma’am(extreme sarcasm) the company is in Florida which means they’re eastern time and also to inform you it’s currently 8:33 pm...I can still take down your name and number to ensure you receive a call.

Caller: WHAT IS YOUR NAME! I DEMAND YOUR FIRST AND LAST NAME!

Just because we ask that your husband is also present doesn't make us a semester company ma'am.,"Long time lurker, first time posting.

I work part time in the call center of a home improvement sales company near my house. We sell things like windows, roofing, siding, etc. It's a small family owned company that has an A+ rating on BBB. Very tough to get in our industry. We maintain that rating by educating both home owners on the products out there and answer any and all questions they might have.

A couple Friday evenings ago, I was closing up shop with a coworker (Cody).

Cody called a woman that had reached out to get a free estimate on her roof and some windows to be replaced. The call was going well until he asked for her husband to be present for the meeting as well. That's when all hell broke loose.

This woman began a verbal tirade on Cody saying that we were a sexist company for requiring that a man had to be present for the appointment. As if she can't make any decisions for herself. She kept speaking over Cody and interrupting him and basically having a temper tantrum over the phone.

After nearly 5 minutes of this, Cody finally snapped and raised his voice on her and politely told her to shut up and let him talk. 

The reason why we require both people to be there is because it's an important decision on the house that they'll be making together. We like to send a rep out just 1 time to the house, so we want to make sure everyone is on the same page. Often times, the husband will ask a question that the wife doesn't think about, or vice versa. We want to make sure that everyone understands the product and the quote. Especially when it comes to picking the color. We have gotten bad reviews in the past because the husband picked a color that the wife didn't like and we had to go back out and fix the complaint. We are conscientious about our rating and want to maintain the A+ BBB.

On top of that, having both husband and wife there eliminates the ""I need to talk to my spouse before making a decision"" excuse to not buy.

This lady was not understanding this and was just assuming that we won't go out just because she's a woman and she'd be the one making the decision. Cody even told her that we say the same thing if a man tries to schedule. He challenged her to have her husband call in under a false name and he'll get the same response if he tried to schedule without her being there.

Needless to say we didn't schedule an appointment with her and wished her luck finding a place that won't require both parties present.",22,0,0,"Just because we ask that your husband is also present doesn't make us a semester company ma'am. Long time lurker, first time posting.

"You Can Run, But You Can't Hide!","I work as a technical support/escalated call handler for an insurance call center. I work the late night shift. Most of my calls are helping reps navigate the ins and outs of various insurance contracts. One of my ***many*** duties of this job is helping reps to understand underwriting criteria. This is to make sure we're charging the correct amount on the policy. Often, this means you the consumer will not be getting good news from my rep or from me. This instance I'm about to share is no exception.

Cast of Characters: Me, Rep, Sir Shady (SS moving forward)

Me: Technical Support, this is mentalgopher, how may I help you today?

Rep: Hi, do you have the policy for SS coming up?

Me: Yeah, what's going on with it?

Rep: He's upset about his premium being so high. He thinks we're charging him more because we don't have correct information on the policy, so we can't verify his license number.

Me (Reviewing policy): The information that he filled in when he purchased this policy online? I mean, sure we can correct it. But I can't guarantee that it'll be cheaper when corrected.

While I'm reviewing, I discover a second policy. One where SS was added to the policy by our claims department. SS had been added onto his parents' policy. On his own policy, SS had put in the wrong date of birth, the wrong issuing state for his license (but the right number!), the wrong zip code (but right address), and had left off all other household family members, including some who operated the insured vehicle. Oh, and the parents' policy had cancelled with a balance owing of over $2,000.

(Important nugget: Most insurance companies require that you include everybody in the household of driving age on the policy. Theoretically, there's access to the vehicles in the household. And even if you've never driven a day in your life, you may still have coverage rights under the policy by virtue of being a resident relative. This can vary by carrier, and policy contracts may address this differently among carriers.)

Rep comes back and states the customer wants to change the date of birth and license state. He will not consent to the update in the address. She runs it and we are looking at an increase of over $4,000 to the term. Turns out SS had the kind of driving record that begs for exclusive use of public transportation.

Me: You sure he's going to be okay with this amount and this change, Rep?

Rep: Yeah, he's being really cool about it.

I don't smell a rat; I smell a full outhouse next to the beach during low tide. I make a mental note to follow up on the policy for the next three weeks. Because the insured had refused to update the address, this was an automatic referral to Underwriting, anyways.

Lo and behold, I check on the policy for the first time the next day. The customer has purchased a ***third*** policy with all the wrong information input. The rate is on par with his pre-corrected rate. He had purchased it online while on the phone with my rep, then called back two hours later to cancel the new policy.

One of my pet peeves is insurance fraud/material misrepresentation. I really hate when they do it repeatedly. Not that I don't appreciate the attempts at giving me job security, but insurance fraud is something that hurts EVERYBODY.

I ended up having to kick this up to Underwriting's management. They didn't mess around; SS got the ""Don't let the door hit you on your way out, and don't bother coming back"" notice three days later. He didn't even bother calling us back. No one grieved this loss.",26,0,0,"You Can Run, But You Can't Hide! I work as a technical support/escalated call handler for an insurance call center. I work the late night shift. Most of my calls are helping reps navigate the ins and outs of various insurance contracts. One of my ***many*** duties of this job is helping reps to understand underwriting criteria. This is to make sure we're charging the correct amount on the policy. Often, this means you the consumer will not be getting good news from my rep or from me. This instance I'm about to share is no exception.

Cast of Characters: Me, Rep, Sir Shady (SS moving forward)

Me: Technical Support, this is mentalgopher, how may I help you today?

Rep: Hi, do you have the policy for SS coming up?

Me: Yeah, what's going on with it?

Rep: He's upset about his premium being so high. He thinks we're charging him more because we don't have correct information on the policy, so we can't verify his license number.

Me (Reviewing policy): The information that he filled in when he purchased this policy online? I mean, sure we can correct it. But I can't guarantee that it'll be cheaper when corrected.

While I'm reviewing, I discover a second policy. One where SS was added to the policy by our claims department. SS had been added onto his parents' policy. On his own policy, SS had put in the wrong date of birth, the wrong issuing state for his license (but the right number!), the wrong zip code (but right address), and had left off all other household family members, including some who operated the insured vehicle. Oh, and the parents' policy had cancelled with a balance owing of over $2,000.

(Important nugget: Most insurance companies require that you include everybody in the household of driving age on the policy. Theoretically, there's access to the vehicles in the household. And even if you've never driven a day in your life, you may still have coverage rights under the policy by virtue of being a resident relative. This can vary by carrier, and policy contracts may address this differently among carriers.)

Rep comes back and states the customer wants to change the date of birth and license state. He will not consent to the update in the address. She runs it and we are looking at an increase of over $4,000 to the term. Turns out SS had the kind of driving record that begs for exclusive use of public transportation.

Me: You sure he's going to be okay with this amount and this change, Rep?

Rep: Yeah, he's being really cool about it.

I don't smell a rat; I smell a full outhouse next to the beach during low tide. I make a mental note to follow up on the policy for the next three weeks. Because the insured had refused to update the address, this was an automatic referral to Underwriting, anyways.

Lo and behold, I check on the policy for the first time the next day. The customer has purchased a ***third*** policy with all the wrong information input. The rate is on par with his pre-corrected rate. He had purchased it online while on the phone with my rep, then called back two hours later to cancel the new policy.

I mailed it in!,"The US Postal Service is a great organization with lovely people who do a hard job for little to no thanks (seriously y'all, say hi and thank you to the postman or postwoman when you see them, they do hard work). Which is why I feel bad that so many irresponsible nerdburgers blame them for their payment not getting to us. 

Now, I understand how people like to write checks. It FEELS like you're paying the bill. Tactile sensation is great. That's why I write a physical check when I send in an electronic one and then void it. Because I'm not fucking around with my bills. Cause I'm an adult. Who totally wears pants everyday, and I never say fuck it and kill a whole thing of Oreos. 

Anyways, I'm having a ball today, nothing but long calls, transfers, and fuck ups by other people in the company. A day where I want to hate every caller, but I can't because every single one of them isn't even an asshole. They're just rightfully miffed that someone fucked the whole thing up, or they are calling from the hospital. Can't these assholes just be assholes and let me riff on them?! Goddammit, stupid empathy. 

Anyways, I'm just sitting there, getting angry at my walls because I just needed to be angry at something, a hero came. Not the hero you want, but dammit did I need this hero. This fucking legend calls in about a late fee. From over a month ago. She has had 3 other late fees reversed this year. 

And this lady was just awful. Shes yelling about late fees and how she mailed the check and blah blah blah. And I  needed this call. My eyes were rolling so much I could power the continental US if they hooked me up to a dynamo. I didn't even bother being nice and apologetic. No, I was blunt. I was honest. I didn't pull a single (verbal) punch. 

""Well ma'am, we received the check late.""

""I mailed the payment [day before due date]! It's not *my* fault you didn't get the check. And I'm a great customer, with [high balance bank acct] and [other high balance bank acct], and you're going to treat me like this?!""

""I'm sorry that you're not understanding me...""

""No no, I'm a *very* smart person, and I have no trouble understanding that you don't value a great customer"" At this point, my eyes are literally just going in circles, I'm getting dizzy. 

""Ma'am, you mailed it [day before due date], correct?""

""That's what I said!""

""Did you overnight it to us?""

""What? I don't know how it got sent, I gave it to someone else to mail""

My eyes are now rolling so fast I'm worried that I'm gonna start zooming around my office. 

""Ma'am, the payment was late. I'm not removing that late fee, or the others because you haven't paid *since* your late payment"". 

""You WILL remove them or I want to talk to your supervisor"" 

""Understood ma'am, I'll get you to a supervisor""

""(Dumb dumb bitch noises)""

And then explained the situation, professionally, to the escalations person, conferenced the call, wished them both a goodnight, and hung up. My eyes, finally freed from the endless loop, started to hurt. I took some tough calls after, but god did it feel fucking good to have someone who unequivocally fucking *deserved* to be hated.",69,0,0,"I mailed it in!

"Jesus, what part of “Final Sale” do you not understand???","So at my job we have a policy of “don’t tell the customers no” EXCEPT when it comes to face masks.  We are not allowed to accept returns on face masks.  We can send new ones out if they are defective but we are instructed to let the customers keep the masks and there are no returns on masks.

The tale of lady who doesn’t understand why pointing a gun at a technician might get the guy to leave and not come back.,"I had quite the call today. Lady calls in shouting that she’s been on hold for over an hour and she’s so glad she finally reached a person. I thought maybe she was just eccentric and went along with it. She spouts off her info at me, luckily her account came up. I start asking her what’s going on. She starts asking me when her technician is showing up to fix her TV. Not my department, but sure, I’ll look. No tech visit scheduled. I tell her I’m going to take a look at the notes real quick. 

OMG. There are so many notes from yesterday. The whole time she’s shouting at me about her issues. I’m trying to listen to her and read these notes. What I’m reading is insane. Basically her TV wasn’t working right so she had to call a technician because she refused to unplug her TV box and try even the slightest amount of troubleshooting over the phone. Then when the tech shows up he sees a gun on her table. Okay, not illegal, but not making anyone comfortable either. So he’s taking a look at it and I guess texts his supervisor about the situation. His supervisor tells him to leave. He let’s her know that he has to go because of this. She grabs the gun and starts threatening him to fix her TV box. He leaves quickly. So she starts calling and telling the people she’s getting on the phone a totally different story, our security team gets involved and locks her account. 

So I ask her what happened and if security has reached out to her. She is not admitting anything. Finally I had to say “ma’am, did you point a gun at the technician? Because that’s why we can’t send anyone.” She goes “oh that? Everyone here has guns, I don’t know what his problem is. I need my tv box fixed. I pay you people so much money each month and he just left without doing anything.” No shit lady. Most people don’t want to potentially be shot while at work. She then starts going on about her friend is going to come over and they are going to start a war. And then she’s telling me her friend took all her guns so I need to send someone out. Nope, can’t do that. 

I ended up just reaching out to a sup and telling her I need her to take over this call. I had to take a few minutes after that call. Not because I was worried or upset, but just in disbelief that people like her exist. ‘Murcia.",1381,0,0,"The tale of lady who doesn’t understand why pointing a gun at a technician might get the guy to leave and not come back.

Me:...... Sir I'm not going to argue. I've already explained why that bill says that. Now if your concerned about the cost for the membership we have lower memberships that are cheaper.

"Customer thinks that by threatening to give me a bad review, I'm going to suddenly give him a solution","TLDR this guy's booking got declined because his cc was invalid (it was a 10.88 USD booking.....) and no payment was collected so his hotel booking was cancelled FOC by the hotel - same situation with one of my earlier posts on here basically. Told him to rebook, we can't guarantee the same prices as his original bc we don't control the prices and its based on realtime..

He wanted a solution, I said it wasn't possible - no payment was collected. The only issue here is that I cannot give him the same price again, he'll have to try his luck and check the prices on his end... From what I know the prices are different for every user. No one in our CS understands the algorithm so we just say it depends on how frequent you book with us but the app provides cheaper prices than the website for sure.

Then guy got mad because at first I said it was confirmed when he asked for the status. When I checked our supplier's frontend, it was cancelled free of charge. Basically we didn't know our supplier initiated a cancellation and it was still active on our backend and frontend....  So I told him yeah I rechecked the hotels emails to you and they cancelled due to invalid cc... 

I was trying to explain this to him but he wouldn't listen at first. I don't remember what he said but he just wouldn't listen so I gave up and didn't listen to what he was saying unless I heard something I could reply to.. I know it's not professional but I really could not be bothered at this point and I'm tired. Basically the conversation was more or less like this

Me: I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.

Customer: What is your function. What do you do. What is your job.

Me: I'm sorry, I don't get you

Customer: (HEAVY SIGH) You said my booking was confirmed just now, and then you said that it has been cancelled. I'm confused.

Me: I do apologise for the confusion, I was trying to explain it to you but you wouldn't let me, sir.

Customer: Okay, then explain

Me: Your booking was confirmed on our end, which was why I had informed you that the booking has been confirmed. After checking again on our hotel's end when you let us know that the hotel had cancelled it, we found that it was cancelled on their end- 

Customer: Ok but thats not my problem. I had it confirmed. I updated my card twice

Me: [trying to explain but constantly getting cut off x10]

Customer: [babbling away &amp; im not registering what hes saying at all]

Me: I'm not able to help you sir, the booking has already been cancelled free of charge..

Me: Ok. Feel free to do that sir

How bothered does he think I am by one survey like threatening to give me a bad review will make me offer a solution to him...",47,0,0,"Customer thinks that by threatening to give me a bad review, I'm going to suddenly give him a solution TLDR this guy's booking got declined because his cc was invalid (it was a 10.88 USD booking.....) and no payment was collected so his hotel booking was cancelled FOC by the hotel - same situation with one of my earlier posts on here basically. Told him to rebook, we can't guarantee the same prices as his original bc we don't control the prices and its based on realtime..

He wanted a solution, I said it wasn't possible - no payment was collected. The only issue here is that I cannot give him the same price again, he'll have to try his luck and check the prices on his end... From what I know the prices are different for every user. No one in our CS understands the algorithm so we just say it depends on how frequent you book with us but the app provides cheaper prices than the website for sure.

Then guy got mad because at first I said it was confirmed when he asked for the status. When I checked our supplier's frontend, it was cancelled free of charge. Basically we didn't know our supplier initiated a cancellation and it was still active on our backend and frontend....  So I told him yeah I rechecked the hotels emails to you and they cancelled due to invalid cc... 

I was trying to explain this to him but he wouldn't listen at first. I don't remember what he said but he just wouldn't listen so I gave up and didn't listen to what he was saying unless I heard something I could reply to.. I know it's not professional but I really could not be bothered at this point and I'm tired. Basically the conversation was more or less like this

Me: Your reservation has been cancelled because of (see above)

Customer: I don't want to listen to you. I don't care about your explanation.

Me: Ok

Customer:  Unless you can give me a solution, I don't want to listen to you. If you want to, then I will listen.

Me: It's not that I don't want to give you a solution, I'm just not able to..

Customer: Then what are you doing.. what is your job.

Me: I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.

Customer: What is your function. What do you do. What is your job.

Me: I'm sorry, I don't get you

Customer: (HEAVY SIGH) You said my booking was confirmed just now, and then you said that it has been cancelled. I'm confused.

Me: I do apologise for the confusion, I was trying to explain it to you but you wouldn't let me, sir.

Customer: Okay, then explain

Me: Your booking was confirmed on our end, which was why I had informed you that the booking has been confirmed. After checking again on our hotel's end when you let us know that the hotel had cancelled it, we found that it was cancelled on their end- 

Customer: Ok but thats not my problem. I had it confirmed. I updated my card twice

Me: [trying to explain but constantly getting cut off x10]

Customer: [babbling away &amp; im not registering what hes saying at all]

Me: I'm not able to help you sir, the booking has already been cancelled free of charge..

Customer: I'm going to give you a REALLY really good review. See how you feel about that.

Me: Ok. Feel free to do that sir 

Customer: I'm a first time user, there should be compensation for this. I'm giving you a splendid beautiful good review

Karen Block A Corporate Card (Again): An Update,"So you guys may remember this Karen from a previous tale ([here](https://old.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/ehpf18/when_karen_sends_a_member_of_the_armed_forces_to/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)). 

Well she's back.This was relayed to me by a good friend who still works there. 

Apparently this friend (whom I trained) noticed that Karen had blocked another corporations control (credit) card. Meaning no employees could use their card for business expense.

How the cards work in this particular business is if a business wants 10 for 10 employees (1 each) the business is given a control card on which all expenses are added on. This way instead of paying 10 different cards the business is able to pay off just one card; the control card which has all the expenses added together.

Now if you freeze/block one of the cards that is **not** the control card other employees card whose card hasn't been frozen would still work. **But** if you stop the control card nobody in that business will be able to use their card.

So here is my friend (we will call her Stacy) about to call a card holder as there were transactions on the card the bank wanted to make sure was the card holder that was the one making these payments.

Stacey notices however, that there is a block on the control card and the card holder has been referred to branch. After some further digging Stacey notices that it was Karen who placed a block on the control card. And given Karen's track record (see previous post) this was not accidental.

So Stacey removes the block on the control and calls the card holder to verify the payment (they were genuine). Stacey had to also report Karen to management. 

It turns out Karen is moving into another dept. where the manager is friendly but also the type to bring a tonne of bricks if you ever fuck up. Will be fun to see what happens with her.

Excited to be starting at a call center this monday,"Here's a little background about who I am: 

I have 8 years of experience in IT/Tech support. I have a few years experience in retail and working at random stores. I'm joining a call center/customer service for a b2b ecommerce website and what they do already seems up my alley. I'm currently at Best Buy and when we were on lock down we had to man the phones, and I quite enjoyed it. I feel getting stuff shipped out properly or fixing order problems is a bit different mentality than dealing with angry end users who want their computers fixed. I also feel since I'm not the sole person in charge of everything like I was at my IT gigs, I know it's not my fault and I'm not who they are angry at! 

I'd be in an order processing roll taking on emails/chats then phone calls. Supposedly new reps can learn the systems in less than three weeks then we work from home. Everyone from the team lead to the head of customer service has told me that my experience will work well there. 

Anyone have a similar path like me and end up loving it?",17,0,0,"Excited to be starting at a call center this monday Here's a little background about who I am:

Call center agent did not violate company policy by telling me what the company policy was,"Some years ago when 3D was the Next Big Thing, I had a camera system that I flew around with to productions and rental houses. The rig was designed to be airline friendly so it could travel as checked luggage. The main rig case was just under 70 lbs, one of the airline cutoff weights.

I was slated to fly from SFO to Vancouver BC, pick up the system and then fly to Toronto. There was an airline we always used because they are Media Friendly. i.e. we paid $50 per bag no matter the weight, size or how many. That is way cheaper than shipping. They just had to meet airline regulations for max size and be under 100lbs.

The leg of the trip from Vancouver to Toronto was to be on a partner airline instead of the usual airline. Hmmm, I check their bag policies and see some trouble coming.  I call their call center and get a wonderful Canadian agent. After going over the issue I learn that the rampies for that airline won't touch anything over 50lbs in Toronto. We both agreed I can't fly with them and I had to cancel the reservation.

I then tell her that I'm not real familiar with the various airlines that go across Canada and is there another airline that does the Van - Toronto route.

She responded with, ""I'm sorry but it is the policy of Big Airline Company to not tell customers about Other Smaller Airline.""

I thanked her and rang off. Then called OSA and got a nice flight with Media rate for the gear and a total lower fare.

You will note that she did not violate the company policy by telling me about the other airline, she simply told me the company policy. Perhaps a bit of malicious compliance on her part.

A year later I found myself hanging out with an exec from Big Airline and told him this tale.

What Did You Just Say?,"I’ve been in the call center world for just about three and a half months, training included. After the movie theater I worked at shut down (thanks 2020), I browsed job sites for work at home positions and got one for a remote tech support company that contracts out to other companies. The team I got placed in works with customers of a large ISP/cable/phone provider. 

Now, I’ve had some of Those Calls, but none that stood out on their own enough to make a post out of. Most calls are just people changing their modems and needing to activate the new one or their internet’s out and they didn’t reset it before calling. Most calls end nicely with me being thanked and the customer being connected. 

Most calls. 

Had one guy whose modem would not connect to our system no matter what we did. I got him a tech scheduled, and in the meantime he asked what he could do. I told him as he mentioned that the modem was hot, he could unplug it and let it sit for a while and see if that made a difference. Then he hit me with this gem:

“Yeah, I’ll put in it in the fridge for a bit to cool off.”

Thankfully I managed to convince him to Not Do That.

Another call featured an older man living in an in-law house on his daughter’s property. He said their power went out but his daughter’s internet came back when the power did while his stayed out when his power was restored. Sure enough, our system didn’t see the modem, and when I asked him, his modem didn’t even have a power light on no matter where he plugged it in. Scheduled a tech, and just for kicks, asked if there was anything unusual in the area that may have caused the power to go out. 

“Oh yeah, a tornado went through my backyard yesterday.”

How do you not lead with that? Especially when you live in a tiny Northeast state that rarely gets tornadoes? 

Next day after tornado man, I had a call from a woman who just wanted to know where the store closest to her was so she could swap out her rented modem for another, thinking it was bad. I told her and when she mentioned she didn’t think it would be open, I told her the hours. 

“Oh, no, I just meant that a tornado went down that street yesterday.”

Same state, different town. What are the odds. 

Tonight, though, tonight is the cherry on top. I am on shift as I type this. I am still redder than a tomato.

I don’t have an official script, just guidelines, and I gave myself a little script just for convenience’s sake. I answer every call as “Thank you for calling [ISP]. My name is [x], and who do I have the pleasure of speaking with tonight?”

Now I work nights, 6PM to Midnight, and my customers are all an hour ahead of me. Because of this, my shift is not very busy and I have loads of time between calls. I end up doing lots of other things from homework to playing on my Switch. Whenever a call comes in, I just shove everything aside and go into that script. 

Somehow, I fucked up. Somehow, my words got twisted as I set aside my Switch and pulled my keyboard toward me. Somehow, the word “speaking” did not come out of my mouth. 

I said “who do I have the pleasure of sleeping with-oF SPEAKING WITH tonight?!”

I. Was. Mortified. I was tensing up like I was turning stone. I was so ready for this woman to rip me a new one. But no. She didn’t seem to notice what just happened and explained her problem to me.

Get me to sales!,"First time posting, several years in call center work. Stupid little call but it made me laugh so I had to share! 

For context, I work in the sales department for an internet and cable provider. People call me looking for prices on internet and cable, but every few calls I’ll get an existing customer on the line because they don’t want to wait on hold and call sales to get to a person (which is fine, I’m happy to help). 

In addition, it may be important to note that although we have local offices, they are closed due to the pandemic, so anything you need must be handled over the phone, although I occasionally do have people who are not happy with this and want to talk to someone local 

A customer called in and his account popped up on my computer screen, so I knew he was an existing customer

Me - Me

CX - customer 

Here is how our exchange went: 

Me: “hello thank you for calling X cable company, how can I help you?”

CX: “I need sales”

Me: “I’m in sales, what can I do for you?”

Me: “Buick... like the car Buick?”

CX: “Yes I need my the sales department for my local Buick dealership, can you get them on the line?”

Me: “Sir, we are a cable company” 

CX: “I know! I just miss the good old days where you’d call an operator, and they’d get you to whoever you need... Figured I’d just call you and have you do it instead, Just get me to Buick please!”

 He was nice enough so I ended up googling the phone number and transferring him, but it still gave me a good laugh!",25,0,0,"Get me to sales! First time posting, several years in call center work. Stupid little call but it made me laugh so I had to share! 

For context, I work in the sales department for an internet and cable provider. People call me looking for prices on internet and cable, but every few calls I’ll get an existing customer on the line because they don’t want to wait on hold and call sales to get to a person (which is fine, I’m happy to help). 

In addition, it may be important to note that although we have local offices, they are closed due to the pandemic, so anything you need must be handled over the phone, although I occasionally do have people who are not happy with this and want to talk to someone local 

A customer called in and his account popped up on my computer screen, so I knew he was an existing customer

CX - customer 

Here is how our exchange went: 

Me: “hello thank you for calling X cable company, how can I help you?”

CX: “I need sales”

Me: “I’m in sales, what can I do for you?”

CX: “no I need someone local”

Me: “we don’t have anyone local you can talk to due the pandemic, but I’m sure I can answer any questions you have.”

"""Ah, you said the word. Good night""","I work for a car rental company as a specialist. Basically when a customer demands a supervisor I take the call.

I received this call back on Sunday. Before transferring me the customer, the agent who received the call explained me that the rental was denied because the customer prepaid with a debit card. Since the pick up location was the airport and she was local, they wouldn't release the vehicle. Solution? Cancel the reservation and issue a full refund, simple, right?

H: HenriquesDumbCousin

C: Customer

H: I was being explained by my agent that you have this reservation at the airport, but they won't release the vehicle, correct?

C: Yeah, I don't have a major credit card, we only use cash and debit...

H: I do apologize for the inconvenience, due to the circumstances I'll have to cancel the Reservation and issue a full refund.

C: But I called three times, I explained them that I was going to pay with a debit card and they told me that it was okay.

To me it's always fishy when they say that they had called in advance, especially if they mention that they called more than one time. It's like when they claim that they had already called and extended the Reservation, only to call later to extend it, why would you call again if the extension went smoothly? Then again, there are some truly bad agents who really need some coaching, so who knows? Maybe she called three times and got three bad agents? 

H: I do apologize for that, while they do accept debit cards at that location, they have some specific requirements, like being an airline passenger and have a return ticket.

C: So basically you're telling me that I'm fucked, I'm stranded and no one can help me.

H: It's unfortunate to say the last, but unless you have a major credit card, there's nothing we can do.

C: But I called three times, I'm sure you have those calls recorded, I told them specifically that I only had a debit card and they knew that I wasn't an airline passenger!

H: I agree ma'am, those agents were misinformed, sadly the only option is to cancel the Reservation and issue a full refund.

C: So I'm fucked? Is that what you're saying? You're fucked, thank you and good bye?

H: If you use that word again, I'll release the call, okay?

She kept telling me that this wasn't her fault, that she had called three times. She eventually asked if she could pick up the vehicle at a location downtown. I would have suggested this if it wasn't for the fact that...

H: You reserved a pick up truck, ma'am, you require a major credit card to rent that type of vehicle.

C: But it's not the airport, they accept debit cards in the city.

H: They do, but only for regular sized vehicles and SUVs, they won't accept your debit card for that type of vehicle.

C: If you don't want to help me, connect me with someone who can.

H: There's no one at the call center who can assist you, ma'am, otherwise I would have done it in the first place.

C: I used to work in a call center and there's always someone who can do something for me.

H: I do apologize, but there's no department that has the authority to have the vehicle released.

C: Just connect me to someone higher than you, I don't care if I have to wait 30 fucking minutes...

H: Ah, you said the word. Good night!

"Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes: A Saga","I work as a technical support/escalated call handler for an insurance call center. I work the late night shift. Most of my calls are helping reps navigate the ins and outs of various insurance contracts. One of my many duties of this job is understanding underwriting criteria and explaining it to others. An additional duty is to keep the company compliant with state and federal regulations. As a result, I don't always deliver good news to my callers. This call was no exception.

Cast of Characters: Me, Rep, Screaming Lady (SL)

As this is long, there's a TL; DR at the end. 

Me: Technical Support, this is mentalgopher. How may I help you?

Rep: Hey, mentalgopher, do you have an auto policy coming through for SL?

Me: It's trying to. What's going on, Rep?

Rep: SL wants to escalate. Her policy cancelled due to underwriting reasons last week and she wants to have it reinstated. She said she didn't get any notice.

(Contextual Note 1: If your insurance company is going to cancel your policy due to underwriting, they are legally required to give you what your state deems sufficient notice before the cancellation occurs. We can email the notice to you if we have your consent, but we're also legally obligated to mail it to you via USPS. This is done so you can cure the issue or obtain new insurance. If your reason for us cancelling your policy is not curable, we will not reinstate your policy with remarkably few exceptions. Some cancel reasons are serious enough where you cannot reinstate or write a new policy with us.)

Me: And she's only just calling us now...?

Rep: Yeah.... She requested a supervisor because I told her she would have to talk about this with underwriting to get this reinstated, and they're closed.

Me (reviewing notes and the cancel notice): She can talk to underwriting until the cows come home, but the notes and notice are clear about this not being something we can reinstate *or* rewrite.

Rep: I didn't see any notes on here.

(Contextual Note 2: This was the rep's second day on the phones, so I cut her slack. There were notes. *Lots of them*, all of which were **juicy**. She was a frequent flier on our line for escalations. I had even documented an escalation from her three months ago when her policy was about two months old. At that time, the only remarkable thing about her was that she had six escalations prior to mine. Now there were about quadruple that number. But the cherry on top was the *reason* for her policy cancellation: She called in a claim, stopped filing the claim midway through intake, called customer service to cut her deductible to a quarter of what it was, then filed the claim again with a later date of loss. On top of that, her kid was operating the vehicle at the time. Claims found out that she had lied on the phone to the agent about this kid driving vehicles and living in the household. I can only tell her the reason for the cancel; I cannot go into the additional details, though I am able to see them.)

Me: Not only do the notes make it clear, but so does the notice we mailed her five weeks ago regarding this issue. I have no problem saying no to her on this, either. Send her on through.

(Transfer comes through moments later.)

Me: Hi, my name is mentalgopher. Am I speaking with SL?

SL: ARE YOU A SUPERVISOR?!?!?!

Me: I am. I understand you're requesting to have your policy reinstated because you feel you didn't receive sufficient notice?

SL: CAN YOU DO IT OR NOT? IF YOU CAN'T, GET ME THROUGH TO SOMEONE WHO CAN!!!!

Me: I want to review a few things with you before we go over this. Please verify your email address and mailing address for me.

(SL bellows her email address and mailing address into the phone.)

Me: Thank you for verifying. We sent out two emails to the email provided on XX/XX and XX/XY dates. A certified letter that went over the cancellation reason was sent out on XX/XX, as well. The notice we provided for this cancellation was more than sufficient per your state's regulations. We will not be reinstating your policy at this time. No one at this company will be reinstating this policy. 

SL: WHY THE F\*\*\* NOT, YOU STUPID C\*\*T?!?!?! 

Me: Per your policy contract, we can cancel you at any time if it's determined that you knowingly misrepresented a material fact or circumstance in connection with the presentation of a claim. That same part of your contract also mentions that we can cancel you at any time if it's determined that you knowingly misrepresented a material fact or circumstance at the time of applying for or obtaining a renewal for this policy. Directing obscenities at me will not change what appears in your contract or reinstate your policy, so please refrain from using them on this call.

SL: YOU AREN'T HELPING ME, THOUGH, YOU B\*\*\*H! I CAN SAY ANYTHING I WANT TO YOU! YOU'RE GOING TO GET ME FIRED FROM MY JOB BECAUSE NOW I DON'T HAVE A F\*\*\*ING POLICY! I DELIVER THE NEWSPAPERS WITH THAT CAR, SO I'LL TELL THEM HOW HORRIBLE YOU ARE!

Me: I'll take this time to ask you again to abstain from using profanity on this recorded call. I will also just verify with you that you're stating on a recorded line that this vehicle is being used for newspaper delivery, but you had it insured on a personal auto policy?

SL: ISN'T THAT WHAT I JUST SAID, YOU STUPID C\*\*T-FACED W\*\*\*E?!?!

Me: Based on what you've just admitted on a recorded line to me, even if your cancellation had been for something other than misrepresentation on an application ***and*** in presenting a claim, your policy was still unacceptable due to the nature of your business use. Normally, I'd refer you to the commercial auto department, but the cancellation due to misrepresentation means we will not write you a new policy in any department. 

SL: WELL, WHAT USE ARE YOU, YA STUPID F\*\*\*FACE?! YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A WHOLE FAMILY HOMELESS!!!!! DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD, YOU HORRIBLE COW?!?!?!

Me: There are other insurance companies, ma'am. There's also your state's insurance pool in the event that at least two insurers in (state redacted) decline to offer you a policy. You should explore those options. Anything else I can go over with you this evening?

SL: NO, YOU F\*\*\*ING USELESS HEIFER! -Click-

TL; DR: Caller is upset that we cancelled her policy for lying to us about two separate yet vital things. She wanted me to reinstate it, swore at me the whole time while I kept telling her no. I found a third front where she lied to us, called her out on it, and tactfully told her to suck it.",135,0,0,"Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes: A Saga I work as a technical support/escalated call handler for an insurance call center. I work the late night shift. Most of my calls are helping reps navigate the ins and outs of various insurance contracts. One of my many duties of this job is understanding underwriting criteria and explaining it to others. An additional duty is to keep the company compliant with state and federal regulations. As a result, I don't always deliver good news to my callers. This call was no exception.

Cast of Characters: Me, Rep, Screaming Lady (SL)

As this is long, there's a TL; DR at the end. 

Me: Technical Support, this is mentalgopher. How may I help you?

Rep: Hey, mentalgopher, do you have an auto policy coming through for SL?

Me: It's trying to. What's going on, Rep?

Rep: SL wants to escalate. Her policy cancelled due to underwriting reasons last week and she wants to have it reinstated. She said she didn't get any notice.

(Contextual Note 1: If your insurance company is going to cancel your policy due to underwriting, they are legally required to give you what your state deems sufficient notice before the cancellation occurs. We can email the notice to you if we have your consent, but we're also legally obligated to mail it to you via USPS. This is done so you can cure the issue or obtain new insurance. If your reason for us cancelling your policy is not curable, we will not reinstate your policy with remarkably few exceptions. Some cancel reasons are serious enough where you cannot reinstate or write a new policy with us.)

Me: And she's only just calling us now...?

Rep: Yeah.... She requested a supervisor because I told her she would have to talk about this with underwriting to get this reinstated, and they're closed.

Me (reviewing notes and the cancel notice): She can talk to underwriting until the cows come home, but the notes and notice are clear about this not being something we can reinstate *or* rewrite.

Rep: I didn't see any notes on here.

"""Oh you'll replace my appliance for me? Cool, give me a bunch of free stuff with it.""","I had a call a few days ago where the customer had an appliance that was malfunctioning, and I already knew It was going to be rough because after I said my greeting I couldn't get a word in for a good little while, and he was saying that he wanted it to be replaced with a different appliance entirely. (We can't do that. It has to be replaced with the same model)

I finally got to speak, got his information, and walked through some TSing. 

Afterwards I let him know that the appliance will need to be replaced, but I can only send the same model. He agreed, and I got him set up for a replacement.

I let him know that the replacement doesn't come with accessories so he'd need to keep any that he has. (These are optional items that you could purchase for the appliance, but they are not necessary for the appliance to work)

Well, he let me know that he wanted these THREE specific accessories included with his replacement, (one of which he didn't purchase in the first place, he just wanted us to send it to him for free) AND a coupon for some free stuff.

I sent him the coupon, but let him know that I can't include the accessories but he wasn't having it, he wanted to stay on the line while I asked for permission. 

I finally let him know that I would need to put in a request with our parts department so they could look into sending them to him, and that he would receive a follow-up email but I can't guarantee anything.

The 'incident',"I don't think that I've ever contributed this here, but this was the event that made me decide that I needed to pursue a different career. I loved my job...until this started.

I can't provide too many details for confidentiality reasons, but I'll do my best to get the point across. TL; DR at the end

There was a major campaign offering customers substantial money back in the form of gift cards. Advertised everywhere. Usually there was communication to us when these events happened, but in this case we received about the same information as the customers did.

The calls started about a week after the campaign started. Customers calling to say they didn't get their gift card when their item arrived. With the first few calls, we made an educated guess that it would be recieved later (which ended up being correct) and followed up with head office for more info. Radio silence.

We had a visit from someone from head office 2 weeks later. When they came to our department, they noticed how many supervisor calls were happening. We explained the situation and they were able to get us a bit more info, 4- 6 weeks for the gift cards to arrive. Perfect, we had a time-frame.

4 weeks hit, we asked for patience.
5 weeks hit, patience started wearing thin.
6 weeks hit, the calls ramped up. All hands on deck, 10 - 11 hour shifts, all OT approved. We were 6 supervisors for 100 agents, when we arrived, we had a lineup 8- 9 agents each waiting for us to take escalations. Most calls ended in being threatened with lawyers. It became par for the course. After hours, we drank. A lot.

Still radio silence from head office. So I contacted the person who had gotten us the information on the time-frame. Was there ANY reason they could give us that they hadn't arrived yet? Yes. It wasn't any purchase. It was a purchase that contained specific features. Not everyone was entitled. Cue more drinking.

12 weeks after it started, we got a list of eligible orders. Only about 20% of the people who were expecting gift cards were actually getting them. We had caps on what we were able to offer in terms of compensation, and it didn't touch even the lowest gift card amount. We were now in constant contact with legal, head office, every one. We begged, please, send a communication, this can't continue. Agents were calling in sick - mental health days after getting yelled at all day, and I didn't blame them. Even the most stoic supervisor was starting to crack around the edges and become heated on calls, this thing had eroded our professionalism.

I sent a report to head office with all of the accounts who had contacted us about the issue. It was substantial. Ended up getting approval for a tiger team of outbound agents to call customers back and offer them more compensation than we were usually permitted.

13 years later, this is still the most stressful thing that I have ever experienced professionally.

Is asking for free stuff and money normal?,"I started working in a call center back in january. Quickly rised and I'm now in escalations. One thing I've noticed (working for a subcontractor that offers call center services to a large company in the US, myself working in central america and in a completely different culture):

Is asking for money and for free stuff common?
In my experience 9 out of 10 calls people request stuff to be discounted, to be shipped free, to be given away and ""compensation"" to be offered for any offense. 

Is this normal in US culture or is it that I'm facing strange individuals? Funny thing is that my company is one of those really cheapo ones where all the products and services need to be as cheap as possible to be able to offer competitive prices, so while we do have compensation options its always a small percentage or something below the $25 dollar mark.

So, is that common practice?

I have made my peace with entitled people.  I understand they exist, and most of their entitlement comes from decades of engrained superiority that customer service instills in them with an unhealthy amount of ignorance.

I love writing professionally cheeky comments on customers accounts.,"This happened today. 

I work for a government agency that has become rather popular in recent days. We had a new program released where people can get additional funds for a 6 week time period. Everyone and their mother has been calling in about not getting these payments, so it’s important we write in our comments whether or not the person has received the funds or not if that’s why they call in. 

This guy was so fun to talk to. We had a great rapport, he was laughing. He asked me if he has received his funds yet, and I fully expect them not to be there, but it turns out he received the funds exactly as the program states he should have (shocking, I know). So I tell him that I’m happy he filled out the notice he received (stupid computer systems) and that all his funds have been deposited. He was pleasantly surprised, which I found amusing. We end the call, and I dispo it. I start to type my general comment, but at the end, I get cheeky with it because all this guy would’ve had to do is check his bank account and 1 news source to get his answer:

“X calling in to double check if he received his (new fed program) benefits. He did.”

That comment is professional enough, and brings me eternal joy. I hope some of you can understand  :)",90,0,0,"I love writing professionally cheeky comments on customers accounts. This happened today.

**Background:**

At the age of 36 I live in my home town in Scotland where I was born and grew up, went to school and have my current job in retail for nearly four years now. This tale, amongst others that follow in this subreddit are from my job before this, where I worked in a callcentre for a national broadband, phone &amp; tv provider. I was in the business faults for broadband/phone line dealing with customers which I dealt with either on the phone or live chat over the 10 and a half years I was there before I was let go (that is a story for another time) - this story is from at some point whilst working there. It's worth keeping in mind that any names of customers, me and the company I did work for have been changed obviously to protect identities.

I did post previously, under the story:

**Scotch:** Sure, let me get some account details from you and lets see if we can get the problem fixed for you today EC.

*\*does account verification\**

I can see from their account they provide emergency services for the highlands - search and rescue style thing for those lost hiking on the mountains.

**Scotch:** Ok HP, I have done all the checks that need to and can see the account is all as it should. I have checked our outages system with nothing showing down in your area code.

*For those who are reading this outside the UK, a typical broadband phone number via copper phone line is 01234 567898 style, as is any standard phone line number, our notice board had nothing for the customer's 01234 code, so in that instance, normal process was to go through basic checks and see if what was happening.*

**Scotch:** What I can do with yourself is go through some checks too see if we can get this back online, before we do I just need to ask, do you or the owner/caretaker of the building not provide you with a secondary line for Broadband/Phone services in case of this scenario?

**HP:** We don't have a backup line I am afraid, to be honest we never really thought of it - as we never thought this type of thing would happen! *\*I died a little inside when I heard that statement - as I had heard it far too often, people not having backup\** But I will mention that to my boss next time we speak! Though I must warn you, I am just the pilot who fly's the helicopter's for the search and rescue and don't know much about this IT &amp; computer stuff but will do my best.

**Scotch:** Not a problem, can I just confirm the number that you are calling from, incase we get disconnected from?

**HP:** Yes, it's &lt;not number connected to account&gt; - but only use this for today and this call, as broadband telephone number oddly still works for incoming calls *(this will be classed as* ***line 1*** *later)*, the other number *(this will be classed as* ***line 2*** *later)* we have on site is our emergency number, which you don't want to call. (Important for later)

**Scotch:** Sure, no worries. Whilst we have been speaking I ran a few checks on the line using our diagnostics systems and can see that apart from some upstream noise on the line which could potentially indicate something on site causing the issue, all appears to be fine. I can see the total downtime of the connection has been for 5 hours. In basic terms, we need to rule out anything your end to get you back online ok? I will keep it simple as possible.

**Scotch:** Do you know what modem/router you have to connect with? It's a typically a silver box with black sides and 4 lights on it? *(This was the typical ISP one we provided at shitty ISP for customers, only difference was it allowed the use of statics compared to the consumer model)* 

**HP:** We have loads of box's here at the command unit with blinking lights on them, so it's going to be a hard one to figure out chief!

**Scotch:** Ok, sure thing - I get that! If you check for me you said the phone line has a phone in it which still has calls on it? Is there a wire coming out from there somewhere that goes to a wall socket of some kind for you to make calls? Your modem maybe connected to that?

**HP:** Sure, give me a moment to check...

*After a few moments of some huffs and grunts and some noise coming from his end, he comes back to me to update on progress. By this point around 15 minutes had went into the call as it took him a bit to verify account.*

**HP:** Ok, I had a look and was able to see that the cable goes from the phone to the wall socket, but that's it - I don't see any box's or blinking lights tied to it.

**Scotch:** Ok, it sounds like an extension socket, not the main master socket where the modem maybe connected, are you able to check to see if you have any other phone sockets?

**HP:** Sorry to be a pain here, but I have an &lt;important meeting to deal with in regards to our company setup here&gt;, but I am glad to know that's not a major issue on the line or to do with your network. Look can you get one of your colleagues to call back on **line 1** (aka - their BB line that received incoming calls, which he advised was NOT the emergency line)  for Thursday? 

**Scotch:** Sure, with this being Monday, we will have slots for them, do you have a preferred time? Also with your IT guy be there or someone who know's your setup there? Also just to confirm **Line 1** is xxxxx xxxxxx and that's the number for the call back? Not **Line 2** on yyyyy yyyyyy?

**HP:** Yeah, the IT guy will be in then, hence asking for Thursday - as I am on holiday as of tomorrow. His name is &lt;random name&gt;, if you call around 11:00 am he should be there and yes, that is the correct number!

**Scotch:** OK, that's it done and thanks for your help today!

*\*click - call ends and I update notes, put it in the queue for callback Thursday\**

Cue Friday when I roll in and manager and one of the callback agents was by my desk waiting on me coming in, asking me to come into meeting room.

**CM:** Ok Scotch, the reason me and **CW** are here are to discuss a call you had on Monday, the company name was XYZ and you spoke to **HP** regarding his fault for the broadband fault, booking a callback for Thursday, is this correct?

*\*after around thirty seconds or so I start to remember it\**

**Scotch:** Yes, I do remember it - why are we here? Do I need the union here for representation? Am I being investigated for something?

**CW:** Don't worry Scotch, it's nothing like that, I called them back as per instructions in the case notes on **line 1** as you stated in the notes, when I called them I heard the guy on the end of the phone saying to me (paraphrasing):

\--------

**Guy End On Phone:** This is the mountain rescue team here, that's the helicopter now being dispatched, can you reconfirm the the GPS co-ords again of the person needing rescued?

**CW:** Hi this is **CW** calling regarding your broadband issue that you reported on Monday?

**Guy End On Phone:** Eh, what? What broadband issue? Who are you? Why are you calling us about broadband? This is an emergency service and emergency line, doing prank calls on this number is wrong!!!! Why are you calling us?

**CW:** I can assure you sir, this is not a prank call? I am calling regarding a broadband fault that **HP** called about on Monday to us asking us to call you back on **Line 1** to talk to &lt;IT Guy's name&gt; regarding the fault?

**Guy On End Of Phone:** Our broadband is working, why are you even calling us? GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOW!!!!

\--------

**CM:** The manager that took that call was me, after speaking to him and a few threats, I listened to your call, to hear your side of it. Everything you did was correct, you followed the process and done things right, even confirmed the contact number from the customer. It actually transpires that broadband was actually on **Line 2** and not the first one, the customer was actually looking at the wrong phone and socket and had got the two numbers mixed up. 

**Scotch:** Ahh, so I done nothing wrong?

**CM:** No, you did not, after him calming down, he asked me to call him back in 10 minutes, which I agreed to. After phoning him back, he spoke to the IT guy who said that he had taken the broadband down for 6 hours to re-do some of their IT setup, change some components around and install some new equipment. which he had communicated out, but **HP** did not know that. He had came in wanting to use the broadband for some stuff, noticed it was down and then called you, whilst the IT guy was taking a break and did not see him. As he left the IT guy came back and finished off the job.

**Scotch:** So, what was the outcome then? Why have I been brought here into a meeting without union? *(When ever I go into any meeting I ALWAY""S request union to keep the meeting correct)* 

**CM:** As for **HP** \- the manager I spoke to on site, after I explained to him that after listening to the call he gave **line 1** and not **line 2** as the right number has been trained on what is right and also to speak to IT first as the initial callback to the wrong number could have cost us *\*shitty ISP\** around £20,000 for the misuse of their service and other costs.  No further action required, from our end - this meeting was just to let you know what happened on the callback just incase it came back, ok?

**CW:** Yeah, everything that could have been covered was - so you have nothing to worry about, the HP guy was just a bit out of the loop!

After exchanging a few pleasantry's we then went back to our desks and continued on with our days, I still remember to it this day.

**TLDR:** **As I sit there, at my desk with my flask of whisky and eating my haggis, I wonder what my next call would be? But then my moose beckons me out the window, indicating another rescue for us to attend! I just hope that it's not a false alarm as we both have been waiting for an easy night, after hunting and managing the lands! If only there was away for people to communicate more effectively...**",28,0,0,"The time I got the mountain rescue team scrambled, along with the air ambulance... Hello all you glorious redditors here, I did post here a few years ago, but long since deleted my account and the tales with it - but alas I thought I would start posting stories of times gone by - now on to the story time!

**Background:**

At the age of 36 I live in my home town in Scotland where I was born and grew up, went to school and have my current job in retail for nearly four years now. This tale, amongst others that follow in this subreddit are from my job before this, where I worked in a callcentre for a national broadband, phone &amp; tv provider. I was in the business faults for broadband/phone line dealing with customers which I dealt with either on the phone or live chat over the 10 and a half years I was there before I was let go (that is a story for another time) - this story is from at some point whilst working there. It's worth keeping in mind that any names of customers, me and the company I did work for have been changed obviously to protect identities.

I did post previously, under the story:

[A decade worth of e-mails all gone, by the simple non clicking of a box. Life is fun, innit?](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/io57yo/a_decade_worth_of_emails_all_gone_by_the_the/)

**Cast for this story:**

**Scotch:** Take a wild guess, hot stuff ;)

**HP:** Helicopter Pilot

**CM:** Cool Manager (went through a couple whilst there, but at this point in time, CM was awesome)

**CW:** Co-Worker

**The Story:**

For this story I was on the front line desk for *\*shitty ISP\** after being on their second line desk for a bit and them wanting me to go back to help share my knowledge with the front line team. enjoy. This call happened on a Monday.

Working from home,"I am currently working remotely from home, due to the pandemic, which I love and completely appreciate. The only thing that’s driving me crazy is that I keep losing connection. So my computer will randomly drop my calls, not load websites, not load my email which I need for the majority of my calls, etc.  we have people that check this and work on it. They keep blaming my Internet, I am paying for the highest speed which is over $100 a month, and I keep having my Internet company come out here and say my Internet is fine. I keep telling our technicians that my Internet speed is amazing until I connect to their VPN. Then then speed goes down to almost nothing.  And then the technician will change his statement and see it’s because so many people are working at home on the server. In the cycle happens over and over and over again.

I’m just curious about how many people are working from home and if so what are the technical problems are you having?

The day I almost got a close friend fired,"So, I worked in a call centre for just shy of 6 months, during my time there, unbeknownst to me, a friend who I've known for years has applied to this same centre and got a job.

We're always chatting and annoying each other when time allows.

One day, he decided he wanted to throw paper at me, and over a colleague, which isn't exactly out of the ordinary, but fine.

The moment I'm off my call, and writing in the account, I retaliate and hit him in the face.

My buddy's a big and kind hearted soul.

Would legitimately not hurt a fly and give you the shirt off his back.

The moment I hear the sweet sweet sound of paper on face, I hear one of the most dreaded words he could've uttered while on a call ""Fuck""

Me, feeling absolutely horrible that the nicest guy I ever met, just said what he did on a call, I put myself into after call, go to the supervisor desk, tell them what happened, taking 100% responsibility because it's my fault.

Obviously my supervisor is super annoyed at me being a dipshit but sends me back to my station, but I bypass my area and relay what happened to my friend, because he could see what I did.

I apologized profusely and told him not to worry about anything, that I'll take any and all disciplinary action that goes his way.

He then breaks out into a smile and points to his phone, and a certain button. The mute button.

He was apparently watching my moves and muted himself before swearing, so there was absolutely no way the customer would've heard him.

Buddy was extremely grateful about my honesty and laughed it off with me in the end.

M: So were you looking to take off Driver or Husband off the policy.

W: Driver.

M: All right. Driver is listed on this policy as secondary named insured. So in order to take him off of this policy we would need a request to remove him to be sent in along with your signatures. I would be more than happy to forward you our contact info so we can process this asap.

W: I don’t understand, why do I need to send in a request? Driver no longer drives our vehicle and I don’t have his contact information. Just remove him from the policy.

M: A request needs to be sent in because he was listed as the secondary name insured. This makes him the second account owner and gives him the same power as you, the named insured, has on the policy. Hence, I cannot remove him via verbal request as it violates our guidelines.

Husband, in the background: I pay for this policy! I don’t remember asking him to be listed as secondary named insured! Just take him off the policy!!

M: I’m sorry, but at some point the named insured okayed listing Driver as secondary named insured.

H: So you can’t just remove him?

M: We can. However, we require a request with signatures to be sent in first for processing.

H: If you can’t take Driver off the policy just cancel it and I’ll find insurance elsewhere!

M: Wife, you are the named insured. You have the authority to cancel this policy and not Husband.

All I could do at this point was leave a note and hope the poor rep who got them next time whenever they decided to call back (probably in regards to a billing invoice or cancellation due to nonpayment notice) could tolerate them better than I could.

TL;DR: could not remove secondary named insured without a request and signatures. Named insured (wife) did not understand nor did her husband (just a driver). Husband yelled at wife to cancel.

Finally cracked on a caller.,"I was barely awake enough to speak to humans but I had to start my shift and hit the dreaded green button that gives the go ahead to get calls. *ding* and gave my greeting which asks how I could help. The woman immediately began yelling at me her issues and complaining and asked for a supervisor right away and that she will not speak to me. I remained calm and explained to her I would still have to verify all of her information and attempt to assist her before a supervisor will even take a call. She yelled some more about how I was not helping yada yada. I explained again that I would be glad to assist her (that's a lie) and let's get through the verification. Yell, yell, yell.

I get yelled at a lot despite being calm, polite and professional to these assholes. I'm a very sensitive person, I can't handle getting yelled at, it's extremely mentally and emotionally hard on me. I have applied at over 100 places in the last 2 years of working here but no interviews even when I call the locations and let them know how interested I am in an interview.

Anyways... Something finally just SNAPPED and it went something like this: ""you're going to stop talking and stop yelling at me and listen to me, I'm not gonna put up with this! I get yelled at all day for not doing anything to cause the hostility and attacks on me, I get paid minimum wage and that's not enough to deal with your attitude or anyone else's attitude. I'm a person with feelings just like you! I have lots of problems right now but I wasn't gonna take it out on you and treat you badly. My cat is dying, I am having health issues but don't make enough money to see a Dr, my health insurance has a 5000 dollar deductible and no copays so I have to pay full cost, I'm stuck at this the horrible job dealing with horrible people and not for lack of trying to get another job. So here's the deal, you can either treat me better for the rest of this phone call and I can see how I can best help you or you can be put back in the queue, wait on hold however long for a rep and go through it all over again, or just let me help you and not be rude!""

She actually was silent for a few seconds, said she was sorry and that she was just very frustrated and will continue the call with me. We did the call, I had to put her on hold a few times to do research to help her. One hold I came back to tell her I'm still working on it and she gave me a sincere heart felt apology admitting her wrong, and I let her know I appreciate the apology. I did solve her problem, though.

I was a switchboard operator at a Veteran's Administration medical center,"A very intoxicated man called one night around midnight from (757) 234-**** and told me that he needed a place to stay. I told him I didn’t have anywhere to refer him to but he was welcome to come to the ED. He started yelling at me and told me he was, “in another city.” I told him to go to an ER in whatever city he was in. He said “they” told him I would get him a bed. I asked who “they” were but he couldn’t remember who he had talked to. I told him I really didn’t have a way to get him a bed and he told me that “the president had just passed a law that said you have to take care of me.” I said I didn’t know what he was talking about and it didn’t matter because there was no one here to connect him to. He started cursing at me and told me to “get someone there.” I hung up on him.


He called back and wanted to know my name. I told him. He wanted my last name but I refused to give it to him. He started cursing and ranting at me and threatening to make me lose my job. He said that the president told him that I would get him a bed and I had to do what the president said. I told him that I doubted that he had talked to the president but even if he had there was no one here to get him a bed. He was screaming at me the entire time. I became very upset and because of this I continued to talk instead of shutting up. He said I had to get him a bed and I offered to connect him to the tele-nurse. He said okay (Not really but I’m not sure what he said since he was still screaming.) I sent him to the tele-nurse and within a minute he called back and said they told me to “hook him up” with the “homeless crisis line.” By this time I was really upset. I told him there was no homeless crisis line but there was a veteran’s crisis line and I could hook him up with that. He said, “Do it, motherfucker.”

I asked him if he had something to write with (And I was getting ready to say, “If we get disconnected” because I didn’t want him calling back.) He screamed at me, “You said you were going to hook me up. DO IT, MOTHERFUCKER!” I was shaking by that point and accidently said, “I’m not putting up with this shit” and hung up.

He called back and told me he had talked to the crisis line and they had taken a report about me. He said he was recording the call and wanted my first and last name. I refused to give him my last name and when he asked for my first name again I said that I had given it to him already. He said he wanted it again. I told him it was Bill. He then said, “You told me it was William.” I told him Bill and William was the same thing. He continued to hound and threaten me. I told him I wasn’t going to keep doing this with him. He then wanted to know, “Why you got so nasty with me when I told you to go fuck yourself.” (Really?) He also wanted to know why I was being so nasty then. I had calmed down by then and calmly asked him if “they” had gotten him a bed. He wanted to know why I wanted to know. I told him I was concerned for his welfare because it was cold and raining. He laughed and told me he was recording everything I said.

Hello from the UK,"I literally just stumbled across this sub and I'm so happy! 

I have been working in a call centre for the past 3 years dealing with insurance. 

Not sure how I have lasted this long tbh and it's great to read your stories as sometimes it can be difficult to deal with some people mentally with this role. Thought it was just me.

I have had office roles that didn't consist of being on the phone however I do prefer this kinda job as it's very in the moment so days go a lot quicker I find, calls only last 5 mins max normally at my place however one bad call can make me want to quit. I get a fair few a week.

She's Going to the FBI,"I received this call about two weeks ago and I'm still curious how this is turning out for her. NB= Nutball caller. Me= me. 

Me: Welcome to [Bank Call Center], my name is renderingme, how may I help you today? 

NB: I just want you to know that you are the 42nd person I've talked to today and I don't think you can help me because your bank's service is terrible. 

Me: I'm sorry to hear that, what issue are you experiencing? 

(We're supposed to determine how we can help the customer before we even ask for their information and some people want to be difficult.)

NB: Well, to start with, what is your name and badge number? And spell them PHONETICALLY. 

Me: *gives out info*

NB: Where are you located? What city and state?

Me: I can only provide the state, but I am located in [State].

NB: Ok, I am going to add you to the list of 42 people I've talked to today and I'm reporting you all to the FBI. I have a long professional career and I know some people, so be prepared for the inquiry. 


At this point I literally had to stifle a laugh. I didn't even know this woman's name or what her issue is at this point but, according to her, the FBI are going to look into me mistreating her over some personal banking issue. Yeah, ok, crazy lady. 

NB: Now, this is how this is going to go. I don't think customer service can help me, so you are going to get a supervisor on the phone or corporate or whoever I need to talk to to get a check issued from my account before it closes. Get whoever I need to talk to because I know you are useless. 

Me: I'd be happy to help resolve this. My I have your card or account number?

NB: NO, YOU DON'T NEED THAT. I AM NOT TALKING TO YOU. GET ME WHOEVER I NEED TO SPEAK WITH, A SUPERVISOR OR CORPORATE OR THE PRESIDENT. I have a long career, I am very highly educated, and I know how this works. 

Me: I will get a supervisor for you but so they can assist further may I have your card or account number? I can pass that along to the supervisor so they can better assist. 

NB: NO, STOP TRYING TO GET MY INFORMATION. YOU DON'T NEED THAT. I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS. THE ONLY THING THAT SHOULD BE COMING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS ""YES, MA'AM."" I AM THE CUSTOMER. 

Me: I apologize but for the supervisor to be able to assist further, it would be easier if they had your information. May I have your name?

NB: GET ME YOUR SUPERVISOR. I TALK DIRECTLY TO THE HORSE'S MOUTH. I DON'T TALK TO PEONS. 

Me: One moment, please, I will reach out for a supervisor now. 

I got a supervisor for her and while I was finishing up my notes, I listened in to their conversation. She refused to give her name or account number to the supervisor either. The supervisor said that information is needed to be able to assist further with her account and she screamed some more and hung up.

Sometimes you just have to say it,"I have had 2 moments where I finally gave in and said stuff I've wanted forever to a customer.  Not fire-able territory but not quality approved.  


I do credit card escalations/sup calls for a major bank.  I am berated constantly.  One woman I was trying to explain interest to was just being horrid.  You know the story, entitled woman, cheap but trying to pass it off as moral high ground or something.  She tells me (after I explained for the 100th time I wasn't waiving the interest charge) ""it's not the interest, it's the principle!!"" Oh lord.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I had this line in reserve forever so I told her, ""Ma'am it's actually the interest ON the principle.""  Luckily she was so full of herself she assumed i was dumb and just didn't get what she meant, but I enjoyed it immensely.  And she never got that fee waived and normally I waive everything because I am tired of arguing to save money for a multi billion dollar bank. 

Another guy was being soooo condescending about this charge on his card.  It was back in the day when if a merchant was billing you repeatedly and wouldn't stop we would try and block them from charging you (called a stop pmt).

"""I don't care if your supervisor says the same thing you just said, i want to speak to him""","I work in as a customer service representative for an international online travel agency, as you can expect I deal with alot of issues pertaining to covid19 so at this point I get yelled at on a daily basis for things I can't do because I don't have the authority to approve ALOT of things contrary to popular belief, and people can't seem to understand that at all. We have very strict procedures and everything is closely monitored, so I'm VERY aware of the limits I have. But Somehow whenever people call our customer service, they think they're going to reach our CEO directly  ?? 


I would like to think I am immune to it at this point, but often it gets too much and really aggravating really quick.


So today has been really slow, but I've been getting cases from difficult as hell customers all week, so I was expecting no less from today. And of course, ask and ye shall receive. I received a call from this Australian lady, she made a ""pay to the hotel"" reservation at some hotel in Australia for this week. In most of our forms we will need customers to key in their credit card (CC) details. Mostly it's just to avoid fraud cases and the like, because there have been alot even with CC inserted still. 


So this lady has her CC inserted to this ""pay to the hotel"" booking. One thing I should note is that for these types of reservations, we are not the ones charging them. We collect their details, yes, but in our system we have no way to charge the card directly. We see the last 4 digits of the card, but thats it. Nothing we can do aside from cancel. The hotels are the one who have the ability to perform the charges because its ""pay to the hotel."" If the hotel approves a refund for these types, the refund comes directly from the hotel's account, not us. And the hotel will charge at any given point for confirmation, most likely before it goes within the cancellation policy.


And so we always get confused customers when the hotel tries to charge the hotel before the check-in date because they assume its paying upon check-in rather than pay TO the hotel. I've never personally used this types of reservations, so I don't know what it looks like on customer's front end. But if we have so much of confusion for the same thing, obviously we have to do something about it &amp; I won't deny that for even one second.


So this lady had her CC stolen, and we weren't informed about it at all and had no clue up until this point. She probably didn't think it was our problem because she assumed her reservation can be paid AT the hotel. So she called in asking why her booking was cancelled, I found out that our supplier cancelled it yesterday because her CC was declined when the hotel tried to charge her before check-in and she didn't respond to our emails from 2 days ago asking her to provide a new one within a day or so, to avoid her reservation from being cancelled. So it was cancelled automatically because we sent her a notice &amp; she didn't respond at all.

Customer: why did you guys cancel without my permission?

Me: We have actually sent an email 2 days ago informing you that your card has been declined and it will be cancelled if we didn't receive your new details.

Customer: Yes I saw that email, but I didn't have reception so I wasn't able to open or reply to it until yesterday when I had actually received it.

Me: i'm sorry ma'am since this reservation has been cancelled and no payment has been collected, we can't uncancel this booking or search for an alternative accommodation for you as you have not been charged for this.

Customer: I don't care, that is not my problem. I didn't have reception, how was I able to access it?

Me: I understand, but your reservation has been cancelled and we can't assist you since there is no charge to this reservation.

Customer: No you don't understand. I want to talk to your supervisor

Me: Unfortunately I can't do that as we're not allowed to transfer our calls to our supervisors. Even if I did, they would advise you the exact same thing I just said.

Customer: i don't care, I don't want to speak to you anymore.

So I consulted with one of my supervisors. Guess what? He said exactly the same thing I did. I told him that I've already pushed her request back multiple times (Idk why we're not allowed to transfer to our supervisors, but I assume its to avoid frequent requests like that?) He agreed that he would take over the case if she kept insisting. He told me to mention the whole ""we sent an email, no response from u, it was cancelled, no payment was received, we can't do anything about it now"" I tried:

Customer: I don't care what you have to say. Transfer me to your supervisor even if he says the same thing as you just did. I want to speak to a supervisor

So I transferred, checked back on the case 2 hours later. Lo and behold my supervisor also couldn't offer any solutions to her since no payment was received. It would have been different if she was actually charged or if she was really not notified at all, we would have offered relocation or some type of compensation for her. We aren't heartless. He even mentions in his notes that he said the same thing I did, and suddenly shes ok with it ???? I don't get that. You couldn't accept our procedure when it came from a normal agent, but the moment you spoke to the supervisor, you're all for it...? You just wasted everyones time.

I understand that if she genuinely had no reception and suddenly found out her booking was cancelled, I would probably be pissed too. But I'd be way more pissed if it got cancelled and I was still charged, which didn't happen here. I'm just annoyed she HAD to speak to a supervisor to get off our backs. What's the point

TL;DR: Customer wanted to speak to my supervisor about our final outcome for her issue, she spoke directly to him and he parroted the exact same thing and she let it go.",40,0,0,"""I don't care if your supervisor says the same thing you just said, i want to speak to him"" I work in as a customer service representative for an international online travel agency, as you can expect I deal with alot of issues pertaining to covid19 so at this point I get yelled at on a daily basis for things I can't do because I don't have the authority to approve ALOT of things contrary to popular belief, and people can't seem to understand that at all. We have very strict procedures and everything is closely monitored, so I'm VERY aware of the limits I have. But Somehow whenever people call our customer service, they think they're going to reach our CEO directly  ?? 


I would like to think I am immune to it at this point, but often it gets too much and really aggravating really quick.


So today has been really slow, but I've been getting cases from difficult as hell customers all week, so I was expecting no less from today. And of course, ask and ye shall receive. I received a call from this Australian lady, she made a ""pay to the hotel"" reservation at some hotel in Australia for this week. In most of our forms we will need customers to key in their credit card (CC) details. Mostly it's just to avoid fraud cases and the like, because there have been alot even with CC inserted still.

Patient tells me I’m violating HIPAA,"So this happened yesterday. Obligatory I’m on mobile. 

I’ve been at the call center handling billing questions and collections for two years now. It’s pretty laid back and great atmosphere usually. Well a few months ago they took a couple of reps off the inbound/outbound queue and put us on this special project. I was one of them. Basically my job mostly consists of calling patients and pre-registering them for upcoming hospital tests,scans,etc. I call this patient and go through my usual greeting “hey this is anywhere hospital calling to pre-register you for your upcoming appt May I speak with patient please?” Here how’s the convo goes after the greeting

P-Patient; M-Me

P: patient speaking

M: do you have a moment to pre-register for your appt? 

P: yes

M: okay I do have to let you know that the call maybe monitored and/or record for quality assurance

P: wait stop, you know that’s illegal right? You’re breaking HIPAA by recording our conversation about my care. That’s supposed to stay between me and my dr. Who has access to this call because this is illegal! 

M: patient I can assure this is not illegal as we are not discussing details of your care. We are discussing the appt for your upcoming scan. What we are discussing today is for billing purposes and appt details like when and where to arrive. Whether or not you can eat or drink anything. I have zero clue why your dr ordered the test for so it’s in no way violating HIPAA. This conversation will be no different than if you called in to discuss your hospital bill with our billing department who also records calls for QA. Our compliance team has access to all the calls made within our center to assure QA and to make sure we do not violate HIPAA at all. So yes it is perfectly legal for us to record this conversation. So with all that in mind do you wish to proceed with the call? 

P: yes but I’m still telling you it’s illegal and I’m not happy about it. 

M: okay I understand 

I’m pretty sure if it was illegal our legal team would have told us by now it’s illegal. Also phone conversations can be subpoenaed along with medical records, billing statements, etc. so yes it’s perfectly legal to record our conversation.

The woman who ruined my day,"I’m on mobile, and I rarely ever post on Reddit. 

I work for a third party company that assists with certain benefits, we do applications and can look at cases for one state in the USA. I want to explain that I like my job, most callers are fine and if they aren’t I can usually deescalate quickly. 

Today was probably the worst day I’ve ever had working for my center. I’ve been there a year, and I’ve had some bad days but today was something else. My very first caller was one of the worst callers I’ve ever had, only two other calls come to mind. She called in to check on her case because there had been a delay in benefits. She was missing paperwork and needed to submit another application, I explained this after I verified her and then she lost it. I got ranted at for 10 minutes, I just let her talk because my head hurt and I knew she wasn’t going to stop. She said she had submitted the paperwork (they always say this), and was concerned with where it was now. I kindly explained that I’m not that office so I wouldn’t be able to find that out for her, but she could call that office directly to ask. She then said I was being combative because I told her I’m with a third party company, she then decided I was going to help her reapply. That meant I was going to have her with me at least another 20 minutes. Every question she wanted to lecture me about how to do my job and how horrible I am at it, she kept telling me not to take it personally but she was attacking me personally. The kicker was the race question, I am required to ask it. I hate that question, and I think it’s pointless. But I will fail my calls if I don’t ask it. I asked her primary race and she gave it to me, but then asked if she had to provide it. I let her know I didn’t have to select one and I could just use a default. She then went completely off on me because I didn’t give her that option before, I explained to her that I’m not allowed to do that because I have to ask them a certain way. She then said I didn’t offer her the default because I was racist, I offered the default 4 times while she was ranting at me. She said she could tell by my voice that I was white and that I was a racist because I couldn’t find her paperwork and I asked her race. We continued but she kept going back to that telling me I was racist and she could tell I hated my job because of the way I treated her. (I want to add that my customer service remained exceptional, my tone never wavered. I am very well respected at my job for my professionalism) I was upset at this point, she honestly hurt my feelings with all of the personal insults. After we finally got through it she asked me additional questions that I did not have the answer to because we are third party. I got another lecture about how I was being lazy and purposely not answering her. I got off this call and I sobbed, and I remained upset for hours. She made me feel incredibly small and worthless, it wasn’t being called a racist that bothered me because I know I’m not. It was the digs at how awful I was at everything. She honestly seemed to enjoy berating me, and I think she did want to take her issues out on someone. I swear that call jinxed me because I had so many rude callers today, and I usually have one maybe two a day.

I asked her primary race and she gave it to me, but then asked if she had to provide it. I let her know I didn’t have to select one and I could just use a default. She then went completely off on me because I didn’t give her that option before, I explained to her that I’m not allowed to do that because I have to ask them a certain way. She then said I didn’t offer her the default because I was racist, I offered the default 4 times while she was ranting at me. She said she could tell by my voice that I was white and that I was a racist because I couldn’t find her paperwork and I asked her race. We continued but she kept going back to that telling me I was racist and she could tell I hated my job because of the way I treated her. (I want to add that my customer service remained exceptional, my tone never wavered. I am very well respected at my job for my professionalism) I was upset at this point, she honestly hurt my feelings with all of the personal insults. After we finally got through it she asked me additional questions that I did not have the answer to because we are third party. I got another lecture about how I was being lazy and purposely not answering her. I got off this call and I sobbed, and I remained upset for hours. She made me feel incredibly small and worthless, it wasn’t being called a racist that bothered me because I know I’m not. It was the digs at how awful I was at everything. She honestly seemed to enjoy berating me, and I think she did want to take her issues out on someone. I swear that call jinxed me because I had so many rude callers today, and I usually have one maybe two a day. Was it something in the air, did anyone else have unusually awful calls today?"

Just Called Every Name In The Dictionary,"So, I work for a NEMT (Non-Emergency Transportation) call center. It's a very emotionally draining job. Whether it's sad stories of someone's illness or I'm getting called every swear word ever invented because of someone else's mistake.

This woman calls in because her Lyft is late. Lyft is one of our vendors. 

So, I pull up her account after verifying the HIPPA tokens and ask what was the appt time. She says 1045. However, that's not what my screen says. It says 1100. (We go by military time, by the way.) 

Then that's when the gates of Hades is unlocked. She  begins to tell me how she specifically told the previous agent her appointment was at 1045. 

She then goes into how since we're working from home we're some lazy b**hes and we can't do s**t right. Just a lot of swear words.

Then she hits me with the famous, ""I know it's not your fault,"" line and then proceeds to verbally thrash me some more. 

I even called her doctor's office, and got the voicemail. I explained the whole situation just to come back on the line to get thrash some more. 

So, she begins to talk to her sister and swear at me and the company again and says how ridiculous this is. 

I try to explain I'm rushing this as fast as I possible can but there's only so much I can do.

The sister is in the background rescheduling their appointments, meanwhile she's telling me all of their alignments and whatnot. I'm sitting here thinking like, ma'am I understand I fractured my hip in the military when I was 19 and will suffer with the pain for the rest of my life....also add carpal tunnel to the list....all at 23.

I can’t take it anymore and I feel like I’m admitting failure for leaving.,"I’m on mobile I’m sorry for anything that I may mistype lolol

I started working at a call center for an extremely large bank in the US in February, two weeks before March. So close to the pandemic starting that I didn’t even finish training before they sent everyone home. It has such amazing pay and it’s full time unlike any other job in my area, it even has benefits down to pet insurance. At first it was fine when we were primary needs only mode. But now we’re going back to business as usual and I remember none of the stuff we were trained originally. They finished others training but because my group had already completed two weeks of it they felt like we needed no refresher. They also introduced stats without informing us of what those stats entailed or how to see how we’re doing on our own. And introduced coaching where we just talk about what we’re doing wrong and if we’re doing anything wrong we’re told the higher ups are watching us. 

It feels like I’m constantly under pressure now to do everything right and I’ve even started noticing that other departments are just plain terrible and never want to take the call when I try to transfer them over. I.e. I tried to transfer a customer to fraud once because they had to go there and the fraud agent would not take the call. I ended up having to escalate them to my supervisor team and immediately they were mad at me for not transferring them. Besides that every time I try to talk to my manager about customers she is super nice about it but just brushes it off like “this is the page to find ways to deescalate a customer.” And this doesn’t even scratch the surface of how bad this place actually is. On top of all that, I get yelled at constantly and I just can’t handle it mentally. I once was told by a customer that she wished my entire family and everyone I knew and loved would get covid and die because I couldn’t refund her $0.14 international fee. I’m not kidding on the amount by the way, it just seared into my memory. 

I’ve started crying after calls which I didn’t do before. I also get so nervous to go in that I will spend the whole night dreading it and then wake up and just sit there staring until I have to leave. I’ve never been so drained in every way. It feels like everyone around me in my personal life is supportive in me possibly leaving and taking a pay cut but whenever I mention it to work friends they seem to react as if I’m just not doing good enough. One of my closest friends also works with me and whenever I bring up a problem I have she shuts it down almost immediately. I know that I should leave and have started applying to a few places, I’m also aware I’m going to take a pay cut no matter what. But I just can’t help but feel like I’m failing. I can’t stop thinking that maybe this is my fault and that maybe I’m overreacting. Or maybe I’m just not detached enough for a job like this? I can’t just not take these things home. It just sucks, it really sucks. 

While on the topic, what kinds of jobs are good for people leaving call centers that don’t have a degree?

You know you're lying. I know you're lying. Why do you do this to yourself?,"I work hotel reservations and customer service for a fairly big company. I have access to a lot of tools you might not assume I need, but that are essential for my job.

TL;DR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

It was like 8pm. The day was fairly slow so I was not in a hurry and it's always fun to do some detective work.

A call came in and the system threw an account and a case at me right away. As I gave my greetings I read all the information I had in front of me and asked for the full story just in case I was missing some info.

The guy on the phone told me he had two reservations for Hotel X. According to him reservation #1 was for monday with a normal rate and reservation #2 was for monday and tuesday with a discounted rate, but he told me the rates were flipped by the hotel and he somehow got charged twice for the one day reservation. He also mentions the case I have in front of me and tells me he was looking for an update.

Now, the case was opened like 2 weeks ago and closed like 5 days after. No one ever contacted him and no refund had been issued at all. First clue something was off.

Second clue something was off was that he actually had 3 rooms at the hotel and one was cancelled. Did he mention the third room? Not at all.

So I ask about said third room and he tries to dismiss it. ""Oh I had another room for the 2 days and I cancelled it, but it turned out my kids did want to go to the hotel after all so I booked it again later. I cancelled that room several days before arrival, don't worry about that one."" and at this point I knew he was saying nothing but lies.

Room #3 was not only booked the same day as #2 but at the exact same time. I did not even have to look at the reservation history because the reservation numbers were consecutive and that only happens when you book more than one room at once.

So I started digging.

Less than 5 minutes later I had in front of me the full history of all 3 rooms, all the account information I needed and even the receipts for these reservations.

&amp;#x200B;

This is what I found:

Room #1 was booked under the discounted rate from the start. Room history showed no changes to the reservation at all. Not made by us, not made by the hotel, not made by the person I was talking to.

Room #2 was booked under the normal rate from the start. Again, room history showed no changes at all.

He apparently booked the wrong rates for these reservations and realized way too late, he knew he could not fix it so he decided to pretend the hotel screwed things up so he could save a couple of bucks.

Oh and the extra charge? Room #3 was not only booked at the same time as #2 but after looking at its history I could see it was cancelled the same day of check-in... at like 11p.m. (That is, in case you are wondering, almost 24 hours after the cancellation policy expires.) This extra charge, and the receipt corroborated this, was a late cancellation fee of one night plus taxes. Not a mistake.

So here I am thinking something along the lines of ""Holy crap"" as I go back to the dude, who I put on hold to look all that up, and told him as nicely as I could that I knew he was making all of this up and that he would get no refunds. 

Now, he could have let this go and I would have done nothing. I would've just ended the call and moved on to the next person on the line because I don't get paid enough to care after a call ends, but he decided to be an asshole.

He called me stupid and a liar, he insisted all he told me was the truth and he demanded a refund. I again told him I would not be giving him anything (All the money he wanted was way over what I'm allowed to give anyway.), he yelled some more and said the magic words:

""I want to speak to a supervisor."" He demanded

""Sure thing"" I said

I could've said no. I could've said something like ""They have the same information I do, sir. They will tell you the same thing I just did."" and just ended the call but, you see, whenever I transfer anyone to a supervisor I am required to make a note on the caller's account. Both for whoever supervisor that gets my call to have something in writing about the issue they're about to be involved in (Besides me verbally explaining everything too of course) and for anyone else that receives a call from this particular person to know how to deal with them.

These notes, I might add, are permanent.

So this dude will not only be shut down by a supervisor, he will also have documented in his account that he tried to lie to us more than once and get a substantial amount of money out of it. And he was a top tier member of this hotel company's loyalty program, so he might actually have some pretty serious consequences coming his way.

If something fun comes out of this whole situation I will update you all.

Shamed for covid testing,"I’m just going to start this by saying my manager is, to put it lightly, a total ass - which I’ve been made well aware of on multiple occasions however he has now stooped to making me feel guilty for going to get a Corona test. 

The company has been a fucking nightmare lately after signing a contract with a major car company - which has resulted in an impossibly large workload for my colleagues and I to deal with. We all truly are trying our absolute best but eight members of the team are currently off work with stress. 

To make matters worse my boyfriend (with whom I live) just discovered two of his jiu jitsu team mates have tested positive for covid. I informed my manager straight away that I wanted to get tested to which he replied that I had no reason to Not be in the office as ‘third person contact isn’t a problem’, he also offered me oh so generously one of my vacation days so I could go get tested. I didn’t want to risk getting anyone Sick and so have booked a vacation day off tomorrow to go to the clinic.

When he discovered this he decided to remind me of how busy we are at the moment and that I should be more considerate of the workload my colleagues have to deal with - “don’t you think you should only get tested if it’s urgent? You know how much work there is to do and cases to close. I really don’t get why you’re doing this... it’s just completely unnecessary, your colleagues are going to be here working hard whilst you’re taking time off”. 

And now I feel like the asshole!! How do you guys deal with your terrible supervisors and managers?? I swear they piss me off more than the customers sometimes!

Kudos call,"This was the last kudos call I ever took, but it's memorable for other reasons.

A tech that had been with the company for awhile calls in to the supervisor line and it rolls over to me, in the upper level of support.  He explains what happened and that his customer wanted to tell someone how he did a great job.  He transfers the call to me, and it goes like this.

I still laugh at this memory,"I work in non-standard auto insurance. For those who do not know, non-standard means we take drivers who other insurance companies may not take since they are a higher risk. This is usually due to people’s age, driving record, not owning a vehicle, etc.

Anyhoo, I got a man one day and I answer in my bubbly customer service voice and go through verification.

Me: Thank you so much, sir! How can I help you today?

Customer: Oh yes! Is my insurance still active?

M: Unfortunately, sir, it is not. It cancelled XX/XX/20 and it will cost $XXX.XX to reactivate it.

C: Okay, that’s fine. Oh, I have one more question. I have to run to the store and put money on a card. Can I have an hour of free insurance?

Now, I’m not proud to admit and I’m sure if the call got pulled I would’ve lost points for my tone more so than my response. But my brain short circuited for a moment and my real voice came through dripping in a tone that can only be taken as “are you f*cking serious?” Thankfully, he either didn’t care or didn’t even notice the shift.

M: **N o .** Sir, I cannot provide any free insurance for any specific timeframe. A payment is needed to have active insurance.

C: Oh, okay. Figured I’d check. I’ll just be careful and call back in a bit. Thank you!

M: No problem! Have a wonderful rest of your day!

I actually ended up telling my manager about the call one day. She laughed. The questions these customers ask will be the death of me one day. Hopefully it’s mostly from laughter.

“If I have to wait one millisecond it’s not worth my time!”,"So I work for a cell phone provider. Today a lady calls in to ask how much time she has left on her contract. Pretty standard clue that they’re looking to leave. I just let her know we don’t have contracts but the only thing she’s really tied to is the remaining financing of her devices. Then I just ask if she is planning on leaving and if so why. She’s really nice and let’s me know they’ve had a ton of signal issues and they’re in an area we have really well covered. I ask if she had ever talked with a member of our tech department to see if there was anything we could fix as they had been with us a really long time and I didn’t want them to leave if there was an issue we could fix.

The One That Made Me Quit,"Hey all. 

So I started my job at a call center back in March of this year. COVID was just picking up steam and I had lost my temp job as a substitute teacher. At the time, I thought anything to get some extra money, especially when everything is as it is, would be good. That's when I got a call back from a fairly well known insurance company offering me a job. 

I jumped right on it. They sent me all the stuff to work from home and I was there the next month. 

Now I am an introvert by nature, but I had worked in a call center before as a political surveyor. I know it can be tiring and people irritable, but I always had a can-do attitude and I even managed to be the lead surveyor at that job. So I thought: this should be a piece of cake, right?

Well that's when I learned that I would be being taught in an entire class of people, with another class following behind me. In hindsight, this was a red flag, but I figured they must be expanding their business and need as many as they can get. 

So we spend the first three months learning the ends and out of insurance and after all that we finally take our tests and get licensed. Sadly half the class did not pass the test (50 percent attrition is also a red flag).

Now throughout the time that they are ""Teaching"" us, we are supposed to familiarize ourselves with their system for writing insurance quotes. Seems pretty intuitive, at first - just type in info and it spits out a quote, right? Most of it is just finesse. 

Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

I didn't realize what an ungodly beast this thing was until I got on the phone and kept getting calls asking things I didn't know about and constantly having to call my manager in for help.  It was stressful, difficult, and unproductive and I started to fear hearing the ping of an incoming call because I felt wholly inadequate. 

Management of course seemed to have had an attitude of ""well, you'll learn, so just do your best."" For someone like me, that was unbearable. And it seriously made me feel worse and worse the more quotes I took and realized I was way out of my depth. When I told my manager that I felt extremely uncomfortable he replied that ""sometimes you have to be uncomfortable to grow and you have a choice between doing that or not growing and staying comfortable.""

At this point, I realized why so many people are constantly being hired: it's a meat grinder and I was not prepared for it all. 

At last I got a call asking for a bind. A simple task - the previous agent had already done the entire quote. All that was left to do was confirm the details, get the payment info, and get it started. Easy-peasy, 1-2-3.  And I was almost there! Before the customer decided he also wanted a mobile home policy. 

What followed was a nightmare. We had not gone over mobile homes at all - only regular houses/condos/and rentals. I struggled through every step, trying my darndest to make it work. Having to call my supervisor on the other line to try to get me through this. 

After 2 hours it was no luck and my customer hung up and said he'd call again tomorrow. 

I had never felt so embarrassed, exhausted, and frustrated all in one. I was stressed and it was the end of my shift.

My supervisor pulls me aside and gives me a talk about how to ""take it easy and relax"" but ices it off with this: ""So, we're going to call him back tomorrow, right?""  


At this point, defeated and beat down, I mumble a pathetic ""sure"".

He pauses and then reiterates and says ""I need a solid yes or no.""

That was the final straw. I told him what he wanted to hear and rather than suffer that indignity again, I simply resigned the next day. 

Was that the right move? Probably not. But sometimes the money isn't worth it. I know moving forward I am going to try to avoid doing any job involving phones again. And to those of you who continue to work in call centers, you have my deepest respect.",22,0,0,"The One That Made Me Quit Hey all.

Why!"
Whoops! Answered with the wrong greeting,"A long time ago, 20 +years, I worked for an outsourced call centre company in the UK. We ran multiple accounts for different brands, including several tobacco companies free gift help lines, and a well known nation wide series of races for a research charity. Accounts with smaller call volumes were sometimes combined, i.e the same agent could get calls from different accounts, and had to check the phone to see which number the caller was dialing to ensure answering with the correct greeting. I think most will work out where this is going. ....

I  was a temp for the research contact, and after the races had finished and the sponsorship forms had all come in, most of us were let go, but the contract required someone to be available to take calls up until the end of the year. As this was now a small volume account it was combined with another small volume account; the tobacco gift line. 

I was the last person on the research account, (which remember I had been answering phones for all year). I had never yet taken a call for any other account.  I was sat there being paid for doing nothing, I read a lot, I folded letters and stuffed envelopes for other teams just to keep occupied.

Then after months of no calls , the phone rang, and I went into my by now Pavlovian response: 

Me: ""Big C Research ,how may I help?""
Caller:  ""Oh sorry, wrong number""  and they hung up. 

Thinking nothing of it I went back to my book. The phone rang again, again answered, with the same greeting.

Caller: ""Uuh I thought this was the number for the cowboy tobacco gifts?"". 

At which point I look more closely at the number coming up in the screen and breath out a silent ""oh shit"". 

Me: ""Yes sir, actually you're correct, my sincere apologies."" 

It then gets worse, as the caller identifies themselves as being from the tobacco company, and in fact being the person in charge of this account from their side of things, and could I transfer them to one of the execs. This I do and then sit and wait for the axe to fall. An hour or so later a lovely lady executive from the top floor comes down to my desk and tells me:  ""Well we nearly lost the account , but we didn't. Just be a bit more careful about checking the number next time."" and leaves it at that. Strangely they didn't renew my contract at the end of the year. Just still trying to work out the wisdom of sticking those particular two accounts together under one call handler???

I have never lost sympathy and kindness so fast for someone,"I work in auto/motorcycle insurance. I had a man call in regards to his motorcycle policy other day and he was already pretty fired up but nothing I’m not used to at this point. For some extra context, our website allows customers to schedule future payments but 9/10 from what I get they always schedule on or after the cancellation date so it never gets pulled and they still get cancelled. Why don’t they fix this? I have no idea. But anyhoo…

Caller: Why did I get a cancellation notice?

Me: Well, you’re due date was 10 days ago. The last available date to make the payment is this Thursday otherwise it will cancel 12:01 AM Friday.

C: My GF was supposed to handle that. Didn’t she make the payment?

M: One moment, I’ll take a further look into this… Okay, so there is a payment scheduled but it’s set to come out the cancellation date. I can guarantee that the payment will not go through since the policy is set to cancel at 12:01 AM day. This will result in the policy needing to be reactivated.

C: GF get in here! Why didn’t you make the payment sooner?! I don’t need to be getting cancellation notices and sh*t. Wtf did you do?

GF: I set it to come out that day because I get paid that day. I had other things to pay for.

C: Like what?!

GF: Our car insurance, utility bills, groceries…

At this point the dude starts screaming at and berating her for spending money on groceries and such and not HIS motorcycle policy. Oh how it made my blood boil hearing this entitled jerk scream at someone who loves him enough to pay for his insurance. The worst part is I can hear the hurt in her voice as she weakly tries to explain herself to him. I have to sit there and wait for him to either come back to me or disconnect since he’s not being foul or a threat to me and a simple “Is there anything else I can help with today?” will not suffice.

C: Lady is there a way you can give us until Friday to make the payment? An extension?

M: Unfortunately I cannot as the cancellation notice is already an extension. 

C: This is bullsh*t. What company doesn’t provide an extension?! I know you can!!

M: I apologize, sir. But I won’t be able to provide another extension on top of the one provided by the cancellation notice.

C: Then get me to your supervisor! I bet they will give me one!!

Me: Okay. *puts caller on hold and calls the sup line*

Sup: Hey, girl! What you got for me?

M: I have man who thinks we can give him an extension when we’ve already sent out the cancellation notice which he clearly has seen. Shut him down.

S: *cackles* Once I stop laughing pass him through. I’ll let him know I don’t have a magic button for that.

I checked back later. He cussed her and his GF out some more, hung up, and made the payment online later that same day.

Sup: Hey, girl! What you got for me?

M: I have man who thinks we can give him an extension when we’ve already sent out the cancellation notice which he clearly has seen. Shut him down.

S: *cackles* Once I stop laughing pass him through. I’ll let him know I don’t have a magic button for that.

I checked back later. He cussed her and his GF out some more, hung up, and made the payment online later that same day.

Edit: TLDR: man lost any sympathy or help he got from me by acting like a man child and screaming at his gf for not paying for his policy on time. Got mad we wouldn’t give him an extra extension on top of the one he gets from the cancellation notice, hung up, and actually made the payment later the same day."

me. service was canceled involuntarily due to non-payment.

Sigh.. what a day (call center adjacent short stories),"So...I don't work in my (health insurance) company's call center, but I consider myself ""call center adjacent"" because in my dept, we're always encouraged to help our members call into our Member Service line, as opposed to just giving them the number and telling them to fuck off, I mean, call on their own. I don't normally mind, but on days like today, it comes in so frequently and takes so long that I can't get to my other work responsibilities. 

See, while they have me set up to work from home, I don't have a way to simply forward a call to the call center, so I have to just stay on the line and listen in, because there's not much work I can do without my phone. Today is one of this days where I'm getting these types of calls back to back and it's really stressing me out. Here's two quick examples of the things I've had to just sit and deal with: 

1. Inbound call from a member I've known for years, says he's had issues making his premium payment so I offer to call into member services, get to the payment portal and let him punch in his info. Payment doesn't go through so I say guess we have to contact one of the reps, and work my way through the overly complicated menu to do so. 

The rep is way too but the book and practically yells at me for being on the line, asking why I can't just forward the call in, as if she doesn't know we're all working from home and my dept isn't set up like that, we use our business provided cell phones and not virtually logged into a call board. Takes about 20 mins for her to verify my identity despite the member giving her full permission to speak while I'm on the line. 

Finally she tries to address his issue, and completely missed the point. Ignores the fact that he tried to make a payment and recieved an error code, wants to jump into the online enrollment issue, but all she can say is ""I don't see you registered, so I can't really help you"" with the member getting frustrated and replying ""well I told you I'm not registered because it keeps giving me an error, so there's nothing for you to look up because I can never complete the registration!"" At which point I have to come back on and act as mediator. 

We finally move in to the real issue, trying to see if, for whatever reason, his acct being in a ""delinquent status"" is affecting him from making payment by phone. She CAN see an attempt was made, but offered no answer other than to try again, and for some reason seemed to be confused by what a debit card is. 

Member: I tried to use a visa debit..


Rep (interrupts) visa debbie? Idk what that is...

Member: no, a visa DEBIT card, I tried to pay the...


Rep (interrupts again) yeah I don't think we take debit, can you use the credit portion? 


Member: your system asked to make a payment by ""credit or debit"" and I tried to use my visa to pay...


Rep (interrupts..again): it's not Amex is it? Cuz we definitely don't take amex...

Member (very frustrated): no, it's a visa card, it's also my debit card, and I tried to...

Rep (yup... interrupts again): yeah don't use the debit number, use the credit card only...

Member:. Can you just transfer me back to the payment portal please? 

Rep: would you like to take a brief...

I had to end disconnect and calm this guy down and told him I'd get us back to the payment portal... We made the payment, no issue this time, thankful, but I had lost 45 mins of my day. 


Then.... Almost immidiately after, get a call from another member who wants to change his primary doctor. I say ""sure, we can do that. I'll have to call in to our Member Service dept, but we can definitely get that changed for you today. Before I call, do you have the doctors info? We need the doctors full name, address, phone number and if you have it, the NPI number would be the quickest method.."" 

Member: ""yes the doctors name is..."" 

Me: oh no worries, I don't need it. I just need to make sure you have it because the other dept will need it, so just hold on to that info, let me get them on the phone..

Member: ok so you need the address? It's 81..

Me: no no worries, just save it for the member service reps. 

I connect the lines, this time there's no 20 mins verification process because this person must have understood my depts role and knows we do this all the time. Speaks to the member: 

Rep: do you have the doctors name and address? 

Member: yeah, the name is Sonia. 

Rep: and the last name? 

Member: oh the last name? Uh... I'm not sure. It's Sonia though, at the clinic where I meant /u/easycure at to enroll

Rep: I need a little more info to look up the right doctor, do you have the phone number? 

Member: no I don't have it. 

Rep: I need the doctors full name to try and search it, do you have any idea what the last name would be? 

Member: it's a sonia...uh.. sonia... v________ (spells out a name that sounds very wrong) 

Rep: ok and what's the address? 

Member: oh ok, she had two, one (is) 87 south ____ and...

Rep: ok slow down a bit, let me confirm the first one, you said 2187 south ____? 

Member: no, I said one (is) 86 South ____

Rep: ok so that's 187 South ____?

(This went on for some time)

Rep: ok I checked the doctors at that address, was the doctor Sonia ____ (much simpler name than what he tried to spell. Literally added letters that weren't there)


It went on a bit with more mishearing and misunderstandings but by this point I was just done, mentally. I laid on my couch and waited for them to wrap up so I could type up my mandatory summary of the interaction and take lunch. Another 45 mins had passed, and when I notify my supervisor that my mid day quota is a big fat zero and he questions why, I just refer him to look at my calendar and see all the dumb interactions I've had today.

Filling a blank file,"(CW) ancient software discussion... so if this belongs somewhere else, I'm happy to comply!

Several years ago (1997) I began work in a software support center for a now-defunct game company. I had to study various games on different operating systems (Mac OS 7, Windows 95, MS-DOS) and sat in on experienced techs' calls to learn the ropes. One day I sat in with Bart (not real name) and a call came in for an older MS-DOS game that wouldn't work in Windows 95 DOS environment.

""Ah!' Bart said to the caller, ""I know exactly how to help you. This older game requires the presence of a file called join.exe, but this newer system doesn't have it. So, we have to make it. *cue: process of making a file* But the file has to have a specific content. You see, when Bill Gates published the file he included the name of his favorite dog from when he was a child, so we have to put the name of the dog in the file. Please type as I tell you: P O K A L I P H I K A okay good *cue: process of closing said file*. Now the game should run okay!"" 

Bart waited on the line while the caller tried it out, successfully! Me, on the listening end, could barely contain my laughter. Bill Gates had no such animal (at least not that we know of) and the caller lapped it up! 

FACTS: The file actually didn't require any content.

What? We can tell customers that? Really?,"I worked in a Tech Support Call Center spent most of the day on the phone, yada, yada, yada.  


\*\*\*Background - a bit long, but needed\*\*\*

For some reason I got tapped to start attending trade shows as a technical representative..... I was supposed to masquerade as a Marketing Type working the booth, unless a Sales person needed me to answer technical questions.    Turns out I was pretty good at being a Trade Show Host (aka Booth Bunny) and the Trade Show team started asking for me specifically to work the shows.    It helped that I'd show up the day before, get my area set-up, so I could walk in the morning and start presenting.  


We did a gig show in New York City.   Huge turn out from my $emp, 3 times the normal folks working our expanded booth.   This time they had everybody fly in the day before, treated us dinner and a show.    Food was good, show was average, but the big part was a guest speaker.

You can hear all us from California gasping.  


There is a solution, these are New Yorkers, they expect you to be abrupt and blunt.  
He mimes hands pushing away ""Yo!  Back up!   I'm from California, I need a little more space""  


If they start all talking at once just tell them to ""Shut up.   I'm the one who is supposed to be talking.""  


And a few more blunt tips.  


Next day I'm on the floor, using everything he taught us.   I'm feeling good, must be doing good, because I'm attracting a crowd.   They start closing in and I'm getting a bit nervous.   Its the Q&amp;A, so they are all shouting questions.   More nervous.   Then I remember that last bit.  


""Yo SHUT UP!  {they shut up, I put up my hands} I'm from California, I need more space"". {and the entire crowd took a step back}.  Not quite the 3 feet I'd prefer, but I did feel much better.

Raising my volume:   ""James, SHUT UP!""   {he stops}.  ""I have your solution, but give me one moment.""   {I did not mute him}.  I stood up, looked at my coworkers who were all prairie dogging ""It's ok, he's from New York.   I'll explain over lunch.""

\*\*\*Background - a bit long, but needed\*\*\*

For some reason I got tapped to start attending trade shows as a technical representative..... I was supposed to masquerade as a Marketing Type working the booth, unless a Sales person needed me to answer technical questions.    Turns out I was pretty good at being a Trade Show Host (aka Booth Bunny) and the Trade Show team started asking for me specifically to work the shows.

Severe case of social anxiety,"To begin with... This isn't to ridicule people with social anxiety or other similar conditions. Fwiw, I'm a manic depressive. I'm merely sharing his story here.

Dude has an issue with his bluetooth headphones right earpiece having a crackling sound. I did troubleshooting and it didn't work (90% of the time we already know it's a hardware issue, but QA insists we stick by the basic troubleshooting first). So then came the time to offer him service options.

Me: Thanks for waiting. I appreciate your patience. Your options are to go to a store and look for a replacement right earpiece --  stocks depend on availability. Or we ship you a replacement right earpiece which you'll get within 7 business days.

C: I have agoraphobia, social anxiety, and [insert another socially hindering condition that I forgot]. I can't go to the store.

Me: ...Honestly, I'm a manic depressive and I have days where I absolutely just don't want to talk to people as well. I can relate. We still have shipping option.

C: I can't do that because you'd have to place an authorization hold on my card so you can ship the headphones replacement to me. I don't have that much in my account.

Me: That's true, there's a hold. It's returned if you ship the headphones back to us after you get the replacement. Instructions and box will come with your replacement. The web payment link expires in 10 days, so you have around 10 days to figure something out with the card.

C: Can I just mail it to you, you repair it, and ship them back to me?

Me: That's brilliant since you have warranty and might not have to pay anything except maybe the shipping, but well it isn't really an option. That's a process we only offer for phones and tablets.

C: That is ridiculous. Under [some legal Act pertaining to people with disabilities] you should accommodate me given my condition so I'm not at a disadvantage and discriminated.

Me: If I had the authority to make an exception, I would. These are policies set forth by people much higher than me. I'm not trying to make this difficult for you, again I'm on your side here, just that these are the only options we have for you.

C: Talk to your supervisor have him Google [law]. Under Section [x] read the entire paragraph.

Me: You're bringing legalities, so I'd like to inform you I'm not a legal representative of the company. If such a law exists you are most definitely entitled then, but since there are legalities involved you'd have to get a lawyer and have them contact our legal department.

C: I just want my headphones serviced. I have a disability that prevents me interacting normally!

Me: Okay, then your options remain the same.

C: I know it's not your fault, so your company doesn't have policies in place for people like me?

Me: I'm actually going through all relevant policies on my end for the third time as we speak to make sure I'm not missing anything out. Nothing here says anything about such a law or anything close to it... I only have instructions here how to guide you to contact our legal department since you've expressed sentiments along that.

C: [proceeds to copy paste the ENTIRE law, with every single section of it] 

Me: I'm really not the legal representative. You have to contact our legal department. I can give you everything you'll need to get to them, just say the word.

C: No, I shouldn't have to do that! You're required by law to adjust and accommodate me! I've been fighting companies for years about this!

Me: And I wish it hadn't been that way. I'd like to join you in the fight, so just give me the go signal and I'll detail everything you need to contact our legal team. (Meanwhile, I contact a senior because I can't gain agreement as per policy. These take place in chat including the customer interaction, if you're wondering.)

(Senior basically assures me everything I've been doing is already correct, none else can be done. I bid farewell to the senior, confident I can take it from here.)

Me: I just contacted a senior and they pretty much just said the same thing I've already given you. 

C: Can I just mail them to one of your stores?

Me: We don't have that process. You have to make an appointment and show up to the store.

C: Can you get me their email so I can verify? You really shouldn't be discriminating and refusing to help me.

Me: I don't see how offering you every single option still means discrimination and refusal to help. Anyway, here's all the info I have for the store. (store name, address, phone number, etc. no email) There you can see they don't really have an email address. None of our stores do. Only way to contact is via phones.

C: I'M NOT CALLING THEM! I haven't had a phone for years and phone calls give me anxiety that's why I took this via chat with you!

Me: You could probably borrow someone's phone and text them.

C: This number is a landline and not a cell phone number! 

Me: Apologies. I don't live in your country so I honestly can't tell an actual telephone number from a cellphone number.

C: So you're refusing me service, therefore I'm discriminated.

Me: We're not refusing service. Please trust us customer service people when we provide information and give resolutions. We've put months of our life into training and we never stop training on the daily. When we give you something, it's accurate and was done under careful consideration. My point being: all your options are final. I've done my part here and have fulfilled my role. I can't do anything that's outside my authority. These are the cards we're dealt, I can guide you how to deal with them and make it work for you, but you have to let me.

C: Get a supervisor and have them review the law!

Me: We are not legal representatives and again, my supervisor and I have already reviewed every policy we have. You have to contact our legal department.

C: (rant again of how he's discriminated)

Me: If you trust someone, have them go to the store and take your headphones. Have them provide the serial number so the store can check your warranty status. Have them bring your ID for verification. You don't have to personally go to the store. That's one workaround.

C: (ignores suggestion, rants again) Where can I get a copy of this chat transcript?

Me: (reiterate everything and educate him, then contact senior again because at this point I'm just tired tbh.)

(Another senior responds and advises me to just repeat everything. I raised him a policy we have where we low-tier agents can end chat if resolution is not accepted after three attempts. Asked the senior if I can end the chat myself or he takes over and repeats everything then ends the chat. Senior gave the go signal to end chat and provided me a positioning statement if I needed one.)

Me: Can I help with anything else? 

C: Yeah, get me a supervisor if they can do something else.

Me: I've spoken with two already and they have the same options I've given you. You may refer to my previous responses for your resolution. If there's nothing else, I have to end the chat here. I hate to do this, but I don't see us getting anywhere with this. I wish we'd met under different circumstances because you sound like a really nice guy, honestly. But, I must end the chat at this point since I've already given you my resolution.

Is it that bad?,"So I’ve been working for this tech company customer service you don’t have to have crazy tech cexperience($15/hr, mehh there’s many ways to promote though)
The training was pretty intense six weeks long and you get dropped if you miss more than eight hours. Now that I am on the calls we cannot have more than one minute between calls and expected to be typing in all the notes but paying attention to the customer at the same time and looking up how to fix their problem... there are no recording devices allowed in the call area including papers pens and phones Iwatches etc...you get surveys and you get coached on any negative surveys the upper level advisers can complain about you called peer feedback LOL The system is pretty complex I felt rushed through training and put on the line to take calls before I fully knew how to do some things. All the newbies sharing stories -so many have stories of people screaming and going crazy on them already. Only half the trainees made it through 

On the other hand bc of covid we are working at home so I’m sure it’s not as strict/intense as being on site. Since there is such a high turnover in training all the supervisors have been super patient and understanding like they are afraid to lose people. I have yet to meet a real jerk in the upper level advisers the supervisors or the customers. Maybe it’s bc we’re at home. It’s only been about three weeks on calls plus six weeks of training and I don’t know if it’s my voice or the way I talk to people but nobody has been an asshole to me yet. “Even the lady that I put on hold and told me she hoped I had an effed up day bitch” didn’t bother me she didn’t know I was still on the line and when I came back on she was calm. If Someone starts getting that nasty tone with me I just put them on hold and take my time looking for what they need.This work is a guaranteed 40 hours in such a shitty economy right now. The only problems I’ve had with this job is with myself not having enough confidence in talking to the customers and being intimidated about looking things up in the system and performing things self taught that I’ve never done before. Everyone is telling me that I’m doing great but I am terrified of every call- is this going to be the person that gives me the most craziest complicated request breaks me down and gives me a scathing review? lol my own mind is the problem with this job. If I know the system I think I would love it but I feel like I just don’t know enough yet. 

So my question is does anybody love this job ???has anybody had this experience like me where the customers were cool and it stays that way? Or was it cool and all went downhill? Is it just enjoyable to some of you who are able to work at home now? Is being onsite terrible? I got hired and trained completely virtual. Anyone love the custys but hate the work environment or vice versa?? Too many questions but please share what you want thanks

My Most Memorable Call,"I will never forget a call that I got a few years ago. (TW Suicide Loss / Depression)

I worked at a credit union, and this call was in 2016-2017. A Middle aged woman called in asking about an issue on her account. It was something simple like an online banking problem or an issue with a loan payment. As we talk she sounds kinda shaky and scattered. She starts crying suddenly and explains that her son committed suicide about a month ago and that she feels very lost. She explained how he was a single dad and now she is raising her grandchildren who are still young and she just felt like her life was spinning out of control. 

Now one thing that I did not mention was that I lost my 19 year old little sister to suicide in 2015. It was a recent loss and I had gone through an extensive amount of therapy afterwards to help me cope with it. Her death had put me in a spiral where I dropped out of school and quit my job to move back in with my parents. This call center job was actually my first job after her death. I heard the fresh shock and horror and grief for her son and I was filled with my own matching pain for a type of loss no one can really understand unless they go through it.

I talked with this woman for over an hour. I told her about my sister and she told me about her son. I told her about what helped my family deal with our grief and talked about how helpful therapy was for me. I told her that there was a local support group of suicide survivors (families and friends who have lost a loved one to suicide). She mentioned that a week or two before she had taken the kids to a local park and seen a group raising money for suicide prevention and honoring people they knew who had passed away. She said that the kids saw the group release a ton of balloons in honor of their loved ones and that they were all really moved by the sight of people coming together to do something like that. She had been sad because she wanted to get information to join that group but was not able to ask anyone on that day before they left.

I was shocked. My parents and I had gone to the park with that same group and walked in honor of my sister. I let the member know ""hey, my family and I were there that day and we were a part of that group you saw. I can get you all the contact information for the organizer and help you get in touch with their resources."" What are the odds that she would call into her bank and randomly end up on the phone with someone who had been at that park two weeks before? I gave her all the info I could and we ended the call. I never spoke with her again. Sometimes I think about her and I hope that the resources that I gave her were able to help her and her grandchildren.

She said that the kids saw the group release a ton of balloons in honor of their loved ones and that they were all really moved by the sight of people coming together to do something like that. She had been sad because she wanted to get information to join that group but was not able to ask anyone on that day before they left.

I was shocked. My parents and I had gone to the park with that same group and walked in honor of my sister. I let the member know ""hey, my family and I were there that day and we were a part of that group you saw. I can get you all the contact information for the organizer and help you get in touch with their resources."" What are the odds that she would call into her bank and randomly end up on the phone with someone who had been at that park two weeks before? I gave her all the info I could and we ended the call. I never spoke with her again. Sometimes I think about her and I hope that the resources that I gave her were able to help her and her grandchildren. I hope they are doing okay."
Greetings,"One of my biggest frustrations is the greeting. We have to say this on every call no matter how I phrase it I frequently get push back. 

So the first part is fine. I have to give out my name, the company and ask for the clients name. 

“Thank you for calling ***** my name is marebear can I have your first and last name please?” 

I have worked for companies where you were able to pre record your greeting and it was nice. It gave you a chance to breathe before the next call and take a quick drink of water. 

Of course I always get the customer who only gives a nick name or just a first name and we have to do that whole song and dance. 

(Most of the time an account will auto populate. This annoyance is for the calls that doesn’t happen on)

Then I ask “can I have the credit card number or social security number on the account” it never fails that they will not wait for me to finish my statement before they start yelling that of course they don’t have the credit card number they lost it!  How idiotic of me to ask. But they can give me their social. Gee thanks. It’s like I didn’t even ask for that. 

I have tried variations of this. When I was new to this job I would only ask for the credit card number but quickly realized that would make clients angry especially if they had just entered it into the automated system.   Eventually I started to ask for social or account number but like with my current situation they wouldn’t wait for me to finish up my statement before accusing me of trying to commit fraud by asking for such personal details. (Some customers have even tried to convince me that it is illegal to ask for their social security number but that is a story for another time perhaps. ) 

So the best way is to ask for account number first then Social but no matter what someone will always be unhappy with that and not listen 👂 for the end of my sentence to hear the other option presented. 

And don’t even get me started on the people who refuse to give any identifying information. If they refuse to supply account number or social we can ask for phone number on the account but that is not always reliable if they don’t have a phone number listed or if a family member or someone else had been known under their phone number. 

Also tied into this is when they ask how I’m doing but don’t wait for me to respond they just launch into their problem. 

OR MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE: when they ask how I’m doing as a trap. They’ll be all friendly and nice give me all the information I ask for and then they’ll ask “how are you doing today Miss Marebear?” And the sucker that I am will be feeling all warm and happy to have a nice human on my phone who’s actually waiting for a response will say something like “oh I’m doing Great! How about you?” And then they know they have me. They can hear the smile on my voice and they say. “Well I’m doing HORRIBLE!”  And suddenly I’m speaking to a totally different person. 

Anyways I have tons of call center tales from the policies to the coworkers, bosses, and even lost loves. I’m hitting a brick wall after working on call centers for almost a decade and this may be a good way to let off some steam. 

Anyways if anyone has any good tips and tricks for getting the account details without starting World War III with your caller I’m always open to new technique. 😂",11,0,0,"Greetings One of my biggest frustrations is the greeting.

"If You Can't Give Me What I Need, You Can Just Hang UP","I work for an answering service.  Long story short, you know how you call the doctor late at night? Someone says they'll call the doctor and the doctor calls you? I do that with many types of companies.

Working for at&amp;t sucks.,"an abbreviated mild call.

at&amp;t me speaking. 

yes is this at&amp;t tv?

yes, do you need help with billing or tech support?

billing. 

ok how can i help you with your bill?

yeah i was told with at&amp;t tv i get 30 days free. 

at&amp;t allowed us to waive this charge cuz it’s a common lie. 

so i would waive it maybe 30% of the time. these refunds didn’t impact my metrics SURPRISINGLY. that’s why their shit so expensive. so if it was between a transfer and a refund i was forced to refund. 

ok and my internet bill just got more expensive out of nowhere?

the bundle fell off of your account. 

who did that to me?

no one. it was a system glitch. i’ll submit a correction on your behalf. 

ok and i see this services doubles in price after a year. 

yes that’s right. 

ok and i need the internet department. 

that’s me too. i can’t transfer. 

ok, my internet sucks. 

lists out router changes to make that they’re too lazy to make and i’m not allowed remote access to the router but i am the internet department. 

couple that with stupid floor support chat which i took many pictures of on my phone. the entire operation is a total shit show. 

ok and can you transfer me to a real supervisor?

all our supervisors can’t do anything.

what hell, man. fuck at&amp;t. i’ve worked for verizon too and much much much preferred them. 

the company is unprofessional and regressive.

another one. i can’t login to my account. 

it’s an unfixable glitch. 

can you get me to tech support?

they don’t have a fix for it. 

so i bought a service i can’t access?

yes. 

my latest qa person forced us to be radically honest which was kinda rough because att will tell you anything to get your money. i wound up quitting after having another job secured.

i will say that 25% of non supervisor staff don’t take calls. and they are so far up the other ones asses. just ridiculous. they can’t even answer questions.

also it takes forever to even be adequate at doing the job. everything is just ridiculously complicated and makes you sound dumb. i got proficient at the job a couple months ago or so and got really good at it a month ago. but everyone you get on the phone sounds like an idiot and it’s not really their fault.",26,0,0,"Working for at&amp;t sucks. an abbreviated mild call.

You know sometimes you get a wholesome boomer.,"I work for a bank and this happened to me yesterday and it really made me think about a moment in my life that really made me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. Sometimes when the call gets off track and lead into other directions it really makes me think about the older days that have gone by.

After assisting a customer with website navigation he asked me a off topic question, he was a older gentleman who was never married.

Customer: Do you have dogs?

Me: Yes, I have two. One is a dachshund and the other one is a yorkie!

Customer: Ah those are some small dogs, I am glad I came across you because you seem to be a dog person. I am as well and recently I got a lab poodle mix! She is one of my favorite dog breeds since my old cocker-poodle passed away. Sometimes I think about what we would do without dogs.

From that statement alone I thought of a story that would never leave my mind and I told it to him. Back in 2018 I moved back home after me and my ex split up, I got home after one and a half hours driving and it was midnight. When I went into my room I sat down on my bed very depressed and sad about what just went down. As I was sitting there my dachshund walked in my room and sat on my bed right next to me, he went to sleep with me that night and every night since then he never really left my side.

Customer: That right there would make a grown man cry... that right there is how you know you have a great dog.

Me: My dachshund Maxx sits next to me when I work at home. He doesn’t like to leave his bed since it’s right next to my desk. When I go camping he does the same thing when I am fishing too.

After a while me and the customer continued to tell stories about our dogs and then after 45 minutes he had to go. I looked back at my dachshund who was laying in his bed and gave him some head pats because he is the best dog that anybody could have. We really take our dogs for granted and all the love that they show us. This customer really proved that some boomers are redeemable and that dogs deserve more live then they already get.

just got off the phone with the smartest man in the world aka “ken from the cape”,"Guys I love you all. Unless you are Ken from the Cape.

You know how once in a while you come across someone that needs to be the smartest person in the conversation? I got a call where within 2 sentences managed to tell me they were in MENSA, told me their IQ was over 140, then asked me if I even knew what MENSA was...in what I call the caviar voice. Dude chill nobody cares about your IQ, at least not at your cable company 🧐

“I’m sorry what did you call for?”

He slowly fed me information using thinly veiled jabs over the course of 10 minutes while telling me his time was also worth big money (as a lawyer or dr no doubt, but I wasn’t going to ask)

everything the man said was either dripping with sarcasm or had a double meaning. 25 minutes in, it boils down to they had gotten 2 movie channels free for 2 years I could only renew one of them at no charge, and remove the other if they really didn’t want to pay. He didn’t want to get rid of either and wanted both for free

“You probably don’t *think* your a bad person” was my personal favorite. He even dictated a short little story saying “of course you don’t wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and say “I’m a bad person, I take advantage of the public” 😂 I rarely break character or laugh at someone being ridiculous but... wtf? Lol!


“OooooK remember you said your time is valuable (200+/hr as he told me) and we have now spent 30 minutes on 15 dollars. Our discussion will be notated to the account, I renewed one movie channel and removed the one you won’t pay for. have a great weekend!!!!” In the most sunshine lollipops and rainbows voice there is

I hadn't realized how many people have poor reading comprehension and common sense until I worked chat support,"Have accumulated gripes since I've had a taste of chat support work. For what it's worth, I'm with tech support.

Often in the middle of questioning a customer to gather understanding about their issue or while troubleshooting, I'd get this quite irritating remark from customers: ""blahblahblah can you help me, please?"" 

And it's so weird to me! Jesus, duh, I'm already helping you aren't I? What did you think we've been doing the entire time? No, seriously, enlighten me. If I wasn't helping you already, then seriously what do you think I've been doing?

I've also noticed some people either can't read or stupidly decides not to read the entirety of my responses. So many times have they asked a question I've literally just addressed in my previous response or two. So many times as well that I've had to literally copy and paste what I had just sent seconds ago. Only then will they accept the answer.

Apparently there are also quite a large number of people who couldn't follow simple instructions. I could literally give step-by-step instructions and still they'd ask, ""so should I do [some dumb shit they think they should do that is totally not what I suggested]"" No, dipshit, I just gave you instructions! Remove the catheter pissing your common sense away and follow the damn instructions!

Another fathoming case of this is when I request two pieces of information on the same message: their email and how their name appears on it. Often they'd give me just one, usually just the email. I know I just have to ask again ""thanks, and how does your name appear on this email?"" But, seriously, why do I have to ask twice? I've requested those two information in bullet format already so as to emphasize and yet... jesus!

Then, there are still those who just don't understand verification. I just said I need your email and how your name appears under it. Then, they'd go all aggro and question why it's necessary. I can't help it but boy do I want to pull a Big Smoke and just go ""ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS GIVE YOUR DAMN NAME (AND EMAIL), CJ!""

They then proceed to complain how we've spent a good 20 minutes just going back and forth why I need these information when I could've been helping them already. Well, like I said the last five fuckin' times I can fuckin' help you, cunt, just that I need your fuckin' email and name first for verification which you could've provided in less than a minute anyway! Instead you dragged this shit along!

Then there are those who just can't accept the resolution they're given. I can't imagine how fuckin' spoiled and privileged these people must be with their lives in general. We don't always get what we want in life, everyone should know this by now. 

How many times do I have to say YOU. HAVE. NO. OTHER. FUCKING. OPTION. I don't give a fuck if you've time-constraints or won't have another spare device to use while yours is in repair!

Your schedule and your decisions in life with regards to solving your issues is your entire fuckin' responsibility as an adult, I'm not gonna plan it for you!"
Lady gives me a heartfelt compliment. I cry after in ACW.,"I work for a large p&amp;c insurance company. I’m in sales. I handle customers who are rejected or receive outrageous quotes due to things way beyond our control. 

Anyway, I’m speaking to this lovely lady from Georgia. I’m sure some of you know exactly the type I’m referring to. She was so warm and accepting of everything I told her even if it wasn’t what she wanted to hear. I shopped her rates, and wasn’t able to find anything that was a savings (on another subject, auto insurance rates in GA are robbery. I understand why but it’s bullshit). 

I’m a softie, so when I couldn’t find her anything I look up a few options in her zip code and get her the phone numbers to reach out to a few of our competitors. Just to help. 

As we end the call she starts telling me that when God made me he did it differently, and what a wonderful person I must be. All because I stayed on the phone and checked every possible option I had. She said she had spoken to many people that day and they all basically couldn’t wait to hang up on her. 

I started tearing up and got a lump in my throat. I had to spend a good five minutes afterward composing myself. I’ve had a very up and down summer just due to everything going on and I truly needed that type of morale boost. 

I think we all can think of the craziest stories because humans as a species just plain suck. It just boggles my mind that being treated kindly by someone In this job environment can completely change My day.",72,0,0,"Lady gives me a heartfelt compliment. I cry after in ACW.

"Ma’am, this is a supermarket","This was one of the weirdest calls ever. 

I worked at a customer help (more like bitch) line for a huge supermarket chain. One night, as we’re close to closing, i get a call. It’s a pissed off woman. The first thing I have to ask is their name and location of their store. She ignored that and started telling me to stay away from her husband. She knew what I was doing apparently, and I wouldn’t get away with it. 

She went on and on about how she knew I was sleeping with him (she said she was in NY and I’m definitely not) and that I needed to stay the hell away from him. She called me a prostitute (she liked that word) multiple times and insulted me as I tried to bring her back to her grievance with our store. 

She was clearly mentally disturbed; I could tell by her voice it wasn’t a prank. I wanted to hang up but since every once and while she talked about our store, I couldn’t. Over and over I was berated for being a cheap whore. Eventually the call ended. 

Was that it? Nah. Within an hour she called again... and I GOT HER. These are randomized calls every time, so the likelihood of that is small in such a large center. Plus, when you call, you’ve got a long list of options before you even connect to someone. She went through long annoying options menus TWICE to call a random person a prostitute for doing her husband. 

I’ll never forget that lady and while i was laughing the whole time at the absurdity of it, I hope she got some help... or became an actress because DAMN what a performance.",88,0,0,"Ma’am, this is a supermarket This was one of the weirdest calls ever.

Being told to log off early due to not enough sales due to the company's broken computers is stressing me out.,"I work in an outbound call center at home at the moment. 

In 2 weeks I've been told 5 times to log off for the day, saying I got ETO'd and to log on the next day to try again because I didn't meet the quota they set.

Issue is their computers are trash. They are old and take forever for the account details to load, absolutely everything lags, only one call comes before I have to restart the application and eats up the time when I could be getting back to back calls with the auto dialer.

Management and IT have been poking their asses so bad. They bluntly said its the computer and it needs to be replaced yet have not gotten back to me in over a week about getting a new computer. I brought it up again with IT and they said the problem is they have to give the new good computers to the new hires.

While here I am losing hours and being coached by management repeatedly for my unsatisfied performance when in reality is due to these stupid technical issues.

"The credit card numbers are vanishing again, fix your software!","I've posted about this customer before. They are a chronic problem when it comes to credit card data security. The problem is that they use a credit card machine that isn't interfaced with our software because that would cost too much, or some excuse like that. We host their software and because of that we're very diligent in making sure credit card data can't be stored in our software. This customer is also very creative and keeps trying various fields and ways of typing the info to try to defeat our security measures. 

We recently rolled out an update with significant improvements to the detection of credit card data in various forms. Basically the code searches for 15 or 16 digits within a certain range of characters and if it passes a LUHN check we then check if it matches any known issuers. If it does then ZAP!!!!! We remove the numbers and replace them with a notice that they were removed and why entering credit card data like this is bad.

Well we got another call from this angry manager wanting to know why our software keeps making her credit card numbers vanish. Apparently it's a bug and we need to fix it. She even bragged that she figured out that if she typed the CC numbers on 4 different lines with an asterisk between each line, the numbers wouldn't get deleted - until the update that is. She was entering this into the guest notes section which has a warning against this in large red letters. I wrote her a response telling her that while there wasn't a bug, we did improve the security of the software and she's seeing the results of it. I explained that it's for her safety as well as ours, since we both share liability if the data is compromised. 

Her response back to me was that it isn't a big deal and if our servers are secure then there's nothing to worry about. It's just a small hotel, after all. I can't wait to see what new method she figures out to store credit card numbers in plain sight.",901,0,1,"The credit card numbers are vanishing again, fix your software!

"Sometimes the consultants are made up from ""condescending"" and ""insulting""","I once got a support call from a ""consultant"" at one of our customers site, they were there to upgrade their Exchange server, IIRC it was 5.5 to 2003 - it was some time ago!

Me - ""What preparation have you done so far?""

They had done no prep, not even AD health checks, they had just walked up and expected to be able to perform the upgrade with me to talk them through the process.

The last time our invoices were questioned.,"OP: Me

CA: Customer's director of IT

T2: Our Tier 2 support desk

Background: I am a seinor administrator at a MSP, the customer in question was notorious for breaking things and then trying to skirt billing (usually claiming one of our technicians was the cause). This is the tale of the last time our invoices were questioned by this particular customer.

On to the story.

Early AM - T2 notices tickets flooding us indicating CA's main site is offline.

T2: Hey OP, CA is offline. What should I do

OP: Reach out to them, check for a power outage, and if the lights are on call their ISP and open a case.

T2: Can do!

... 15 Min Later ...

T2: CA says their internet is down and is looking into it.

OP: Sounds good - if I'm needed let me know.

... 1 hour Later ...

T2: CA called back in after their ISP said the internet is fine and said they need to know to get into the firewall.

OP: Remind them of their credentials and see if you can help them connect.

T2: Already did that, they said nothing is coming up when they try to get to the firewall.

OP: Have him hotspot his laptop and send him over.

T2: Sure

OP: Hi CA, so it sounds like you are having some problems getting to your firewall.

CA: I am, we are down here, I have already rebooted the switches, firewall, and modem - No luck. Now I'm not able to get to the firewall, I think it is defective.

OP: Alright, do you have your laptop handy and connected to the hot-spot?

CA: I do

OP: Great let me get connected... Alright can I have you plug your laptop into one of the switches?

CA: Sure

OP: Hmm ... no DHCP, that is a bit odd.

CA: DHCP stopped working after I rebooted everything, do you have a spare firewall you could get out here ASAP.

OP: I do not, lets look into this a little further. Lets try connecting to the switch directly behind the firewall.

CA: Alright ... done.

OP: Still no DHCP, ok lets go ahead and static the IP on your adapter and see if we can hit it... Nope nothing. CA could you walk me thru how you rebooted everything?

CA: Sure, I unplugged the modem then plugged it back in, pressed the reboot button on the firewall until it rebooted, then I unplugged the switches and plugged them back in.

OP: I see ... let me check something.  


I was pretty familiar with the particular model of firewall they were running and didn't recall there being a reboot button on the device. I pulled up some documentation on the device just to make sure I was not having a lapse of memory.  


OP: So I'm pretty sure you reset your firewall.

CA: Yeh, that is what I said - I pressed the button and it rebooted. This firewall is garbage.

OP: No, you factory reset your firewall, the configs are gone, we are going to have to reconfigure this firewall.

CA: Oh is that going to take long?

OP: Me

CA: Customer's director of IT

T2: Our Tier 2 support desk

Background: I am a seinor administrator at a MSP, the customer in question was notorious for breaking things and then trying to skirt billing (usually claiming one of our technicians was the cause). This is the tale of the last time our invoices were questioned by this particular customer.

On to the story.

Early AM - T2 notices tickets flooding us indicating CA's main site is offline.

T2: Hey OP, CA is offline. What should I do

OP: Reach out to them, check for a power outage, and if the lights are on call their ISP and open a case.

T2: Can do!

... 15 Min Later ...

T2: CA says their internet is down and is looking into it.

OP: Sounds good - if I'm needed let me know.

... 1 hour Later ...

T2: CA called back in after their ISP said the internet is fine and said they need to know to get into the firewall.

OP: Remind them of their credentials and see if you can help them connect.

T2: Already did that, they said nothing is coming up when they try to get to the firewall.

OP: Have him hotspot his laptop and send him over.

T2: Sure

OP: Hi CA, so it sounds like you are having some problems getting to your firewall.

CA: I am, we are down here, I have already rebooted the switches, firewall, and modem - No luck. Now I'm not able to get to the firewall, I think it is defective.

OP: Alright, do you have your laptop handy and connected to the hot-spot?

CA: I do

OP: Great let me get connected... Alright can I have you plug your laptop into one of the switches?

CA: Sure

OP: Hmm ... no DHCP, that is a bit odd.

CA: DHCP stopped working after I rebooted everything, do you have a spare firewall you could get out here ASAP.

OP: I do not, lets look into this a little further. Lets try connecting to the switch directly behind the firewall.

CA: Alright ... done.

OP: Still no DHCP, ok lets go ahead and static the IP on your adapter and see if we can hit it... Nope nothing. CA could you walk me thru how you rebooted everything?

CA: Sure, I unplugged the modem then plugged it back in, pressed the reboot button on the firewall until it rebooted, then I unplugged the switches and plugged them back in.

OP: I see ... let me check something.  


I was pretty familiar with the particular model of firewall they were running and didn't recall there being a reboot button on the device. I pulled up some documentation on the device just to make sure I was not having a lapse of memory.  


OP: So I'm pretty sure you reset your firewall.

CA: Yeh, that is what I said - I pressed the button and it rebooted. This firewall is garbage.

OP: No, you factory reset your firewall, the configs are gone, we are going to have to reconfigure this firewall.

CA: Oh is that going to take long?

OP: Well, it isn't going to be quick. Hold on let me see if I have a backup of the settings.

Sometimes the tips aren't cash,"I was out on a repair today.

I was there right before Thanksgiving, turns out the video board was farked on their XPS 410 running Win10 32bit (!!)

It also was hung in ""CRITICAL_PROCESS_STOPPED"" boot loops.

I went in today, installed the video board, and it still boot looped.

So I had previously backed up her user directory onto an external HDD (yes, the recovery tools CMD prompt worked for this; couldn't boot to safe mode command prompt.)

I reloaded Win10, recopied her files over, and got her software she needed up and running.

I also made sure it could print.

As a tip, the husband gave me a gallon storage bag filled with ghost and jalapeno peppers(!!!!)

How can you not have this board,"A bit of back story: I used to work Technical Reception (not exactly sure how that translates) for a company that was selling pre-built PC's and pc parts and equipment. This was around 2009-2010-ish (this is important later). People would come to our reception desk for warranty and non-warranty repairs. Normally I was only allowed to do a visual inspection of the device, enter it into our ticketing tool, print the form and tell the customer to come back x days later or when his case engineer would call him.

Now, the company has been in business since the mid 90's, and even since then , used a very particular SN-ID sticker for all pre-builds sold, which was still around when I worked there.

Now to the story:

One late afternoon, in comes an elderly gentleman with his wife, and something that looked like a sewing machine with a cover on , under his arm. My colleague and I exchanged a very confused look but asked them to come to the desk. 

In that cover was one of the first generation PC's our company has sold (SN-ID sticker included). This thing was old, ancient even, by 2009 standards. Either a Pentium I or some sort of 5x86 PC. In pristine condition. I mean there wasn't a speck of dust in that thing. Both my colleague and I were shocked how good it looked and that is was still functional. 

The reason, the elderly gentleman has brought this fossil from a long forgotten era to us was because they just got FTTB and wanted to be able to go on the internet to chat with the offspring, and the thing was lacking a network card. The problem was, we weren't selling ISA cards since a ""few"" years now, and we couldn't help him. No other port option was available for his system. The gentleman was very outraged, because he has bought this Desktop PC from our company about 10 years ago and he is still expecting us to service it. 

  
We tried to explain that due to its ""age"", compatible parts were hard to come by, I mean we had a few in sort of a parts museum we had laying around the reception area, but no stock. We explained that he might be able to purchase one through other means (not from our company), but he was adamant he has to buy it from us. 

Then began to explain that he is a retired Train Engineer and no matter how old the locomotive was, you were always able to buy replacement parts for it, when needed. Took us two hours to try and make him understand that a locomotive is designed to function and be maintained for a significantly higher number of years than a PC, he still wouldn't yield. 

He left very upset and threatening that he will never buy from us ever again. 

This was an exercise in frustration, that left us sad, angry and amused ...",317,0,1,"How can you not have this board A bit of back story: I used to work Technical Reception (not exactly sure how that translates) for a company that was selling pre-built PC's and pc parts and equipment.

Can you please read me the serial number?,"Such a simple request which cost me two hours of my time. Working a tech support for a hard drive company. We needed a name and a serial number before we could help. It’s an afterthought as even if out of warranty we would still help and trouble shoot. 
First call comes in and it’s one of those where you know the guy on the other end is always the one in charge. Even before I would tell them my name and where they called they demanded my full attention. Boss voice who’s always knows people would follow. 
States his hard drive isn’t turning on, fair enough normally it’s an easy walkthrough to check. 
Now to the meat of the story, I do my normal hello after ten minutes of the guy flailing words at me. I ask for a name, he makes heavy wording to make sure I add in his info that he’s a Doctor, oh boy.
After getting his name down I ask for the serial number of the hard drive. He’s flabber gassed that such a thing could exist. After narrowing down his product, which is at this point 10 years old, we all memories what each hard drive looked like and could figure it out by what it looked like. 

I finally got him to give me the serial number, but it was very odd, it seems backward? I asked if the unit was on, which got me a cancerous reply no. After 30 more minutes explaining how to read it he finally ever I slowly gave me the info, he sounded winded and in pain? I asked what might be the problem and he explained his head hurt because he was standing on his head leaning over his chair to read the information. I kindly explained he can just flip the hard drive over which again rewarded me with more nasty I’m a doctor smart me no need help!

Finally got the info after a total 1 hour and 30 minutes... he forgotten to plugged it in since the last time he moved it. He was so happy he figured it out all by his own(hint not). He was again complaining that he shouldn’t have had to stand on his head, which I explained I never requested this.

Imaginary issues call for imaginary solutions,"This is a story from a couple of years ago when i was still doing tech support for a giant company.

"User, help thyself","Way Back When, I worked in IT for a FTSE 250 food manufacturer. One of my tasks was the creation, maintenance, support, and processing of Excel data capture forms. I really did my best to make them user friendly and helpful, but you can't help some people...

One day, I was called by a senior accounts person who didn't know what was required in a field on the Supplier Maintenance request form.

Therefore it had a lot of different lookup lists - some of them restricted what the users could enter; others were used by internal processes to determine which bits were needed.

- $CHAD - gym lad
- $AM - account manager

I worked in tech support, essentially acting as a second pair of eyes for people calling in (“there’s no option to send!” Did you try clicking the big green send button? “No one told me that!). You get the deal.

As a tech support technician, I helped with...tech. One thing I did NOT handle was accounts, billing, contracts, etc. Even if I wanted to, it’s not something I had any level of access to see, much less perform. Users had to email or call their account managers, who worked 9-5.

Everyone who used our service had annual contracts, paid either yearly or (more commonly) month to month. We had a pretty idiot proof method of ensuring accounts didn’t go delinquent. Daily emails, voicemails from the AM, and a huge banner across the tool that cannot be dismissed, stating exactly how many days they had until their account was suspended due to nonpayment.

Enter Chad. Chad calls in at 19:00EST, or just exactly past midnight in London where he was based, screaming the site was down (it wasn’t). I look up his account, and see it’s suspended due to 6 months (?!) of nonpayment. I inform him of this, and he’ll need to backpay, plus late fees, in order to restore service. I inform him he’ll need to call in tomorrow during business hours to settle this with his $AM.

In a word? Explosion. 10 mins of him screaming no one told him, our system is terrible; he deserves free months for his ordeal, the usual. I pulled up his history, and can see email read receipts showing he clicked on the delinquency emails, as well as login history, showing he was logged into the system and had seen the banners. I didn’t even bother bringing this up. 

$Chad doesn’t accept the answer that no one is in the building except me and 6 others, and demands I reset the system, which I cannot do. Then he demands I call the $AM’s personal phone number (which I do not have? Idk them?) to wake them up to process it. He hangs up and calls back, but I grabbed him out of the queue so no one else had to deal with him.

At this point, $Chad states they will not get off the call until this is resolved. Admittedly, $chad had me a bit here, since we are “under no circumstances” allowed to hang up calls unless they threaten violence or legal, which he had not done.

It was also 20:00 at that point, and I needed to make the last train home, so I did the only thing I could think of, and transferred him to my cell (hiding the number).

I packed up, walked out the building, and walked across to the train. When he heard the noise he asked what was happening, so I just replied:

“I know you’ve said you’re not ending the call, and I know I’ve told you the solution, which is to call your $AM when the business opens. I need to start heading home, so I figured we can multitask and go over these options as many more times as you need to understand while I head home. Now, which part would you like to go over again, how long until an account is suspended?”

I think I broke him, I got a solid 30 seconds of silence, followed by screaming that he understood it but didn’t accept it blah blah blah. 

So, I started my hour long commute home with this guy. The train was super loud so I had to keep asking him to repeat himself (and sometimes I did it for fun). Conversation went like: 

“sorry train is super loud, can you repeat? Are you asking me why I don’t know a stranger’s cell number again? Well, your $AM is not someone I know, I’m not friends with them. You have their email to contact them yourself!” Super peppy the whole time, talking to them like I was explaining shapes to a toddler.

He finally lost it halfway through, said he was suing me personally, and I got to hang up.

I was fully expecting an office trip the next day, but strangely nothing happened. The account moved to expired 3 months later and all the data was deleted. Last I heard it had gone to a UK collections agency.",1824,0,1,"I’m not hanging up until this is resolved! TL;DR: don’t play chicken against someone with nothing to lose and nothing better to do.

Our COO listened to me,"TLDR: It took me 3 years to get over my imposter syndrome. I work at a great company. 

A little background: I'm in software tech support but my job duties vary widely and include a lot of data management in spreadsheets.  In fact, ""Spreadsheet Queen"" is my unofficial job title. 

I work for a national real estate franchise and the COO was one of the people who interviewed and hired me. He's a great guy, but comes off as intimidating.

My manager let's me know we're having a meeting on the annual awards process and realizes that as I am the person who does the majority of this work that I should be in the meeting. 

I'm sure everyone in tech support has had a process at work that is tedious, repetitive, and could be simplified if only you could get ""the person in charge"" to listen. This is one of the worst I've encountered at my job. 

Awards are time consuming and a ton of the data that needs to be entered manually is unnecessary.  In the meeting about awards I express this sentiment to our COO and explain how much OT I pulled during the previous awards season (how much It cost the company) and actually say, ""What is the least amount of data you'd be comfortable with here?""  Welp, by the end of the meeting my spreadsheet had about half as many columns as before.

The next day I realized that I didn't even hesitate to point out the issue and generally made the meeting with my manager, 2 Directors, and the COO about this one issue that massively impacts my team.  All of this without flinching. Specifically proud of this since I used to be 90% anxiety and 10% water any time I was meeting with our COO.

Even though it's not directly related to this meeting, I will add that I got a promotion later that week to the equivalent of a team lead and actually felt like I deserved it.

A tale of magic boxes and users who think they understand magic,"background:

I used to work for a small company that only made ""magic boxes"". These magic boxes were essentially adaptors that took whatever weird interface your machines needed(RS232, RS485, RS422, GPIB, various ethernet standards, printer port, CAN bus, SPI, USB, current loop, 3.5mm audio jack(I wish I was kidding about that one) and anything else ever spotted on an outdated piece of industrial equipment) and converts it to a proprietary standard that works a suprising ammount like ethernet with a proprietary connector(don't tell anyone). You would then connect all your machines to a switch we sold you, and your internal network to that. The switch didn't connect the machine network to  your company network, rather the entire machine network showed up as one device on your network and the switch would act as a sort of firewall, only accepting command from a registered workstation. Usually this would all ""just work"", except for some very weird setups.

When I started we were a small company selling to local customers, untill some company that sold entire factory solutions and retrofitting decided every one of their installations would include some of our magic boxes.

The customer calling today was a redirect from said solutions company.

SA: smartass, customers internal techie

me: me, technician and tech support

SE: software engineer, the genius that put the ""magic"" in magic boxes.

me: Thank you for calling this is \*magic box company\* how can i help you?

SA: Your piece of shit GPIB interface isn't cooperating again, \*solutions company\* said to call you guys.

This was fairly common, GPIB often had loose or oxidised connectors.

me: Have you tried re-seating all cables going to the box?

SA: Yes ofcourse, I'm not an idiot, I know this stuff

me: Are the PWR and HOST lights one or blinking?

SA: Ofcourse the power light is on and the HOST ligh is blinking, just like it has been for months

me: Sir, thats not possible, our boxes only work when the HOST light is on, indicating it has network.

SA: You're wrong, it has been working since we installed it, only the GPIB often fails

me(increasingly confused):Ok, well, can you hook up the tester you should have gotten with the system between the network and the GPIB box, try to send a command to it and tell me what it says.

SA: I already did that, it keep saying ""code 44A""

Now i'm really confused but at least we're getting somewhere. Code 44A meant ""valid packet, incompatible header format"". If their switch configuration was nonstandard we could have made a mistake somewhere. Time to look up the firmware we flashed onto that thing

me: Right, can you give me the serial number of the GPIB box and the common switch?

SA: The serial number of the GPIB box is 12345679, and the switch is ABCDEFG

This concerned me because while the box number was valid and indeed sold to that customer, the switch number was supposed to be in our inventory because someone RMA'd it. After confirming the number again and sending a guy out to the warehouse to confirm we in fact still had it, I got back to SA

me: SA, I have that switch sitting on my desk, it can't be in your factory.

SA: oh yeah, uhm, i uhm, decided we didn't need the switch and just returned it

me(Screaming internally): Well sir that would be your issue, the adaptor is not hooked up to a switch

SA: No, it was working fine for months without, i just crimped an RJ45 connector on your cable and connected it to our own switch.

me(screaming externally): YOU DID WHAT?

SA: Yeah I know i'm so smart, you couldn't trick me, I knew it was just ethernet and nothing special.

me: It's  on a seperate network than the rest of the building, right? RIGHT?

SA: No, its just on the internet, its more convient because we can control it from every computer.

me: DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW BAD THAT IS?

SA: I'm a network expert, this is fine, I know this better than you

To give some context as to why this is BAD, these machines didn't have passwords. They were designed to connect to a single computer with a single cable, not a network. And our boxes just translated literally input to output, so no security either. All the security was in the custom switch isolating this from the internet. So in this case, anyone on the entire internet could send commands to their 25 ton machines and 5000° furnaces control them however they liked.

me: SA, disconnect all of our boxes NOW, I am contacting our lawyers, we are not talking to you or your company before you get those things off of the network. \*slams phone\*

I told SE this who PROMPTLY implemented a check to make sure new boxes wouldn't do a damn thing unless a specific ""activation"" packet was sent by our switch. We were laughing/crying about this for days. Wventually we got their installation fixed but by the time we got there SA had been let go. Judging byt the ammount of contractors on site, including a lot from \*solutions company\*, he screwed up the system in various other ways as wel.

It: Log out then log in. Security: I dont have the info you think I do,"First time posting so I apologize if anything is misunderstood or badly typed. Love reading these stories because I used to work for a company that did Tech Support over the phone for TVs. Started with a V. I loved that job except for the screaming Karens of the world. (I threw a shoe at my TV can i have it replaced? No. WTF?) anyway here's the story. 

So background:  I have some IT experience and general things I've learned over the years. I made a switch from IT to Security because I liked being able to tell Karen to please go away or I'll call the cops. Currently I work for a security group at a hospital overnights and I discovered an issue with the camera system early into my employment. Old Manager either did not care or did not understand enough to care. After almost a year I was promoted because old manager left, someone filled his spot and I filled theirs.  I took it upon myself to learn as much as I can about our camera systems. I was able to discover that we, security, don't have much control over the cameras because ""we are contracts and NOT essential."" Now granted I know if your world feels/seems safe you don't worry about security but as far as security goes we need to be able to see what goes on around the place. I was able to make some things easier by changing the amount of cameras we an watch on two screens from 16 on 2 monitors (32 in total) to 36 on 2 monitors (72 in total). Gradual of course so no one was angry by the amount of change. 

Sorry about the long background. Just annoyed about how long it took to get this issue fixed. So the issue is this: On one monitor we have the ability to set up camera profiles that include cameras from multiple servers. On the other monitor we have only 1... ONE... server to choose from for camera profile set up. After I was promoted I decided that I was going to fix this issue and allow the second monitor to be able to see the other camera options. It would simplify camera profile options and clean up the monitors from needing to jump from one monitor to the other to see if someone is walking down a hallway or not. So I submit a ticket and try to write as well as I can because I believe I don't know the system well enough to say ""hey fix this (computer jargon) now."" Apparently I may have over simplified or not made the issue clear because I get an email back, 2 months later, that I need to log out and log back in using our security credentials. Seems pretty straight forward right? I tried a ton of troubleshooting. The system auto log ins to the camera system so I couldn't simply do a forgot password reset. My boss says he doesn't know about any default security log ins. I looked for default log ins, none, I tried different peoples log ins, nothing, I found different server ID log ins, didn't work. (I did all this with the permission of my boss) I spoke with my boss and he said to speak the head security guy for the hospital. So I shoot him an email asking for details about the program so I can fix the monitors. He sent back and email saying step by step how to log out and log back in, with pictures! No he didn't tell me what the log in was. I asked him and he referred me back to IT. So I send another ticket... 2 weeks later, nothing. I try again... nothing. I talk to my boss and his boss because they would also like to see this issue corrected, neither are tech savy and would rather I handle it. I ask if it would be okay if I escalate the issue to the head of IT, they say yes. So I do.... and I try to spell out everything, what monitor ID is using what server, what computer log ins I've tried, what one monitor is able to do and what the other can't. Guess what? Another email about how to log in and log out. I'm getting furious because I feel like I'm getting the run around. So one morning at the end of my shift instead of emailing them I call... I was hoping to speak to someone but I got an after hours voice mail. (I had tried this in the past but was sent another email) I state that I am the Third Shift Supervisor and have Tech Support Training and am tired of being tried like I don't know how to log in to a program. I say that either one of 2 things is going to happen: they are either going to come down and look at this or I am going up there to get them. (More or less, I was sleepy and angry about being told to log out and in) At 10 minutes before the end of my shift I get a call on the security phone with someone from IT saying he is sorry that we have had this issue for so long and he is here to help. I explain everything again but this time he remotes in and see exactly what i'm talking about. Security didn't have admin access so a lot of the stuff he pulled up I wouldn't have been able to see. Turned out that the Security profile for that computer was set up incorrectly. Who ever set up the program at the start only allowed the program to see 1 server and nothing else. So what did he do? He found out the credentials for the other monitor and logged into the other monitor with those. He set it up too so that when the computers are forced restart it would use the new log ins and not the old, repeating this issue. I thanked him so much for Finally fixing the issue and said that while logging out and in was the fix, I wouldn't have been able to do anything like what he did. He laughed and tried to recruit me to IT. I got out of tech support because I got yelled at too much by people who broke their own stuff so I declined and again thanked him. (All in all, this took 3 almost 4 months to get fixed)

I was able to make some things easier by changing the amount of cameras we an watch on two screens from 16 on 2 monitors (32 in total) to 36 on 2 monitors (72 in total). Gradual of course so no one was angry by the amount of change. 

Sorry about the long background. Just annoyed about how long it took to get this issue fixed. So the issue is this: On one monitor we have the ability to set up camera profiles that include cameras from multiple servers. On the other monitor we have only 1... ONE... server to choose from for camera profile set up. After I was promoted I decided that I was going to fix this issue and allow the second monitor to be able to see the other camera options. It would simplify camera profile options and clean up the monitors from needing to jump from one monitor to the other to see if someone is walking down a hallway or not. So I submit a ticket and try to write as well as I can because I believe I don't know the system well enough to say ""hey fix this (computer jargon) now."" Apparently I may have over simplified or not made the issue clear because I get an email back, 2 months later, that I need to log out and log back in using our security credentials. Seems pretty straight forward right? I tried a ton of troubleshooting. The system auto log ins to the camera system so I couldn't simply do a forgot password reset. My boss says he doesn't know about any default security log ins. I looked for default log ins, none, I tried different peoples log ins, nothing, I found different server ID log ins, didn't work. (I did all this with the permission of my boss) I spoke with my boss and he said to speak the head security guy for the hospital. So I shoot him an email asking for details about the program so I can fix the monitors. He sent back and email saying step by step how to log out and log back in, with pictures! No he didn't tell me what the log in was. I asked him and he referred me back to IT. So I send another ticket... 2 weeks later, nothing. I try again... nothing. I talk to my boss and his boss because they would also like to see this issue corrected, neither are tech savy and would rather I handle it. I ask if it would be okay if I escalate the issue to the head of IT, they say yes. So I do.... and I try to spell out everything, what monitor ID is using what server, what computer log ins I've tried, what one monitor is able to do and what the other can't. Guess what? Another email about how to log in and log out. I'm getting furious because I feel like I'm getting the run around. So one morning at the end of my shift instead of emailing them I call... I was hoping to speak to someone but I got an after hours voice mail. (I had tried this in the past but was sent another email) I state that I am the Third Shift Supervisor and have Tech Support Training and am tired of being tried like I don't know how to log in to a program. I say that either one of 2 things is going to happen: they are either going to come down and look at this or I am going up there to get them. (More or less, I was sleepy and angry about being told to log out and in) At 10 minutes before the end of my shift I get a call on the security phone with someone from IT saying he is sorry that we have had this issue for so long and he is here to help. I explain everything again but this time he remotes in and see exactly what i'm talking about. Security didn't have admin access so a lot of the stuff he pulled up I wouldn't have been able to see. Turned out that the Security profile for that computer was set up incorrectly. Who ever set up the program at the start only allowed the program to see 1 server and nothing else. So what did he do? He found out the credentials for the other monitor and logged into the other monitor with those. He set it up too so that when the computers are forced restart it would use the new log ins and not the old, repeating this issue. I thanked him so much for Finally fixing the issue and said that while logging out and in was the fix, I wouldn't have been able to do anything like what he did. He laughed and tried to recruit me to IT. I got out of tech support because I got yelled at too much by people who broke their own stuff so I declined and again thanked him. (All in all, this took 3 almost 4 months to get fixed)

Sorry for the rant. I've ever been able to tell one other person that understood my frustration."
The missing rodent and other stories,"I have a couple more short but sweet stories I wanted to share, so here we go.

Backstory: I'm a social worker that got promoted to local admin because I know how to google. Some of my coworkers are great, just not very tech savvy.

&amp;#x200B;

First story involves my beloved coworker Coco and her a little more tech savvy coworker Dodo.

So, it all begins with me visiting Coco and Dodo in their office because I had some leftover acrylic paint that I wanted to give to Coco (who is a great painter too). 

Dodo tells me, that they received a notebook from our manager in case someone on their team wanted to work from home. According to Dodo they can't access the remote desktop though and could I please take a look while I'm here.

Before we take it out of the drawer though there's some more smalltalk (I'm technically on break and here to visit Coco) about the whole working from home business. Coco really wants to make this work, but still needs help getting started.

While talking we take out the notebook, open it up and suddenly Coco pauses, looks a bit confused and asks: ""So, where is the mouse?""

It turns out Coco has never seen a touchpad being used. So to not make things more complicated than necessary I fetch a spare mouse and plug it in.

Oh, and the actual issue with remote desktop? Turns out the notebook wasn't connected to the wireless network yet...

&amp;#x200B;

Next story is about fans.

So, this time I'm walking around trying to fix some printers when a coworker strikes up a conversation.

old\_Dodo: ""Sorry to bother you, but I need to tell you, my pc is making strange noises.""

me: ""Well, that's not good...""

old\_Dodo: ""Yeah I thought so. Maybe it's the fan.""

me: ""That's very likely...""

old\_Dodo: ""Could you come take a look and maybe clean it?""

me: ""Uh...""

old\_Dodo: ""A couple years ago there was a similar issue and the pc of our coworker Toto caught on fire...""

me: ""...""

old\_Dodo: ""Back then the admin took a vacuum and cleaned every pc in the building...""

me: ""...""

old\_Dodo: ""...""

me: ""Ok, how about you write me an email and cc our manager so I can make it an official ticket and get it done (or send the trainee)""

old\_Dodo: ""Great idea... (That burning pc still haunts me though)""

&amp;#x200B;

Third story is about ""redundancy"".

&amp;#x200B;

Our friends Coco, Dodo and their team are helping young apprentices during their training with additional coaching, tutoring etc.

One day it is decided, that these apprentices don't just need training in their profession but also basic IT skills (i.e. how to google, use office etc.). 

So the team heads out to organise a course for those in need, to teach them these skills.

Invitations are written, the schools computer room is booked and a volunteer teacher is acquired.

The day draws nearer and preparations are going swell.

So far I'm not involved at all. I'm also not available at all because I'm sick and currently staying at home.

I get better though and one day before the set date I decide to start working again but from home so I don't infect anyone. I open my mails and listen to my phone mailbox and get blown away by increasingly desperate messages.

Turns out, the team around Coco and Dodo didn't realize, that you need certain login credentials for the computer room to be able to use the needed software and there's only 3 people that can give these credentials and set up the accounts. There's the central admin in a city far away (""I'll get back to you asap..."") My coworker and second local admin (""I'm on vacation. Leave me alone!"") and me.

Ooookay let's see. Course is tomorrow and nothing is set up yet. Time to work on a miracle and perform some magic.

The Internet isn't working so they asked a retail associate to do a technicians job,"It's a long post but a good read

Your cast of characters:

M: Me
K: Kiosk owner
C: Coworker

So, as you can probably assume by the title I don't work tech support. I'm a sales associate at a consumer electronics store. I'm pretty tech savvy but most of the issues I'm faced with by clients can be resolved through basic troubleshooting or putting something into pairing mode. 

A few days ago the manager of the sweets kiosk next to our store came in frantically asking for me by name. She was having trouble connecting to her business' WiFi and needed someone to fix it. Without the WiFi  connection she was unable to connect to her Point of Sales system or recieve orders from Uber Eats. It was a crisis, especially considering Black Friday was only a few days away!

M: ""I'll see what i can do, but I'm not trained to fix these issues. I can do some basic troubleshooting but your best bet is to contact (ISP) to see if they can fix it on their end or send a technician out right away""

She gets one of her coworkers who looks like he's also management to call the ISP. I think back to my personal experience with internet issues and things i remember from watching The IT Crowd

M: ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?""
K: ""Yes, but try again just to be safe""

I unplug the modem, wait 15 seconds and plug it back in

M: ""Could you tell me if that worked""
K: ""One second""

She brings up her POS program and waits for it to boot up, after a many seconds it gives her an error message saying she can't connect to the internet. I realize then that they probably won't be much help as she could've just checked the internet icon and it'd be quicker. I start thinking what would Moss do? Probably run away, but she'd get mad if i did that. What would Roy do? Is it plugged in? Well yeah i just plugged it back in when rebooting... Hang on, that gives me an idea, there are two ethernet cords and a phonejack cord plugged in. What if they're loose or defective? I try unplugging them and re inserting them and still no luck.

M: ""You don't have any extra ethernet cords to connect to the router, do you?""
K: ""I don't know, you can check in the box with our spare modem?""
M: ""Spare Modem?""

She goes to the cabinet I'm working at and takes out a box right on the side with the ISP's logo. Inside is a newer model modem with all the packaging and cords

M: ""When did you get this?""
K: ""We had some issues a few months back and the guy from (ISP) gave us this just in case.""

They were using an old modem this entire time, maybe that's the issue? Maybe the modem is defective? It could still be one of the cords but if i replace every part i can probably fix the issue.

C: ""(ISP) wants to know if it's DSL or Fibre.""

Shit, I've never lived in a place with Fibre. I remember from my retail training propaganda something about Fibre having a lot of hairlike glass strands to transfer internet at the speed of light and this one looked like a regular telephone cord

M: ""Oh, that's easy. It's DSL...*mutters* probably""

It's truly the blind leading the blind. I feel like that guy from the greentext story of working tech support. Sadly for me, the internet isn't working so i can't download Adobe reader and hope for the best. I set up the modem except the ethernet cords. The modem only came with one spare, but they have 2 ethernet cords in their old modem. I figure it's unlikely both of them would stop working and i don't even know what devices they're connected to. I can test each individually to see which one might be broken. If it actually is an issue with both cables i can connect one and sell them a second from my work to make that sweet cat-6 commission.

M: ""Okay, it's all set up, I'm just going to ask you read this number to me on the new modem""
K: ""Why don't you just take a picture with your phone?""
M: ""That probably would be easier""

I go to the tablet they use for Uber Eats orders and check the network settings. I find the WiFi network written on the new modem and enter in the password. And it's not connecting... not completely atleast. It says you need to be signed in to connect to the internet.

C: ""What's the issue?""
M: ""It's saying i need to sign in. I've seen this before quite a bit but usually it's only comes up if you're on public WiFi. I'll just bring up a browser and it should let me sign in.""

I bring up chrome on the tablet and it says there's network connectivity issues. I've been at this for over 15 minutes and I need to get back to my store. I try connecting to the computer with their POS system to the new network but no luck. I'm about to try swapping out the ethernet cords when I overhear the coworker on the phone with the ISP

C: ""So you're saying we just need to pay the bill and we'll be reconnected?""
K: ""I thought you paid the internet bill this month.""
C: ""I guess I forgot.""
M: ""Brilliant, once that's paid your internet should be working again. If it doesn't work right away just unplug this power cord *pointing to the modem's power cord* wait 15 seconds and plug it back in. If you have any problems just come to the store and ask for me.""

I didn't bother reconnecting the old modem, I figured the newer one should work just as good if not better. The store owner gave me some sweets to enjoy when I took my break and sent me on my way. I definitely could've done some things better but as i mentioned at the beginning I'm not IT, I'm a retail sales associate. I did the best I could based on general knowledge.

The BEL Problem,"Fifteen years ago or so I was still in the middle of my studies but during the summers I worked tech support for a paper mill.

All the regular support calls went to a different group so our team mostly got the tickets that couldn't be handled remotely. So a lot of the stuff we did was hardware swaps, cabling stuff and so on. But sometimes we got problems that were more unique.

&amp;#x200B;

In one of the big factory halls where they made the huge paper rolls whenever one was ready it was transferred to a printing station. There the printing system read an RFID tag from the top of the roll, made a Telnet connection to a central server which received the RFID data and then sent back printer control commands which made the printer print stuff on the top of the paper roll with large red letters. This included the warehouse location so the forklift drivers knew exactly where to store the rolls afterwards.

This system had worked fine for years but at some point a problem appeared. Every once in a while the printer would go haywire and would start printing gibberish on each roll. Rebooting the printer always fixed the problem but every roll that had gone through during this had to be checked manually which caused extra downtime which can cost a lot in that kind of an environment.

They had already tried all the obvious fixes. They'd had the local guys investigating this and the people from the printer system company. They'd changed the printer, changed the cables, changed the nearest network switch etc. Finally for some reason the case ended at our desk and since this was the summer and half the team was on vacation I ended up investigating this.

So, we connected a network analyzer between the printer and the switch in order to find out what exactly was being sent when the printer went crazy. And a day or so later the incident happened again.

I took a look at the traffic log, stared at it for a moment and then went 'Aaaahhhhh'.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've ever used a DOS era PC you probably remember what happens if you start banging at the keyboard toddler style. Beep beep beep beep! The keyboard input buffer gets full and the computer starts beeping at the user to slow down.

Well, this feature was often also implemented in thin clients and if the user connecting to a server tries to type too fast, the server will send back ASCII BEL characters to tell the user's device to beep at the user in the same way.

&amp;#x200B;

So how does this relate to the misbehaving printers?

Well, as luck would have it sometimes the RFID tags on the paper rolls included a little more information than usual. When the system sent out the data from one of these, the data sent to the server was just a little too much to fit directly in the server's buffer and the server would send a BEL character to the printer to tell it to slow down.

However the printer system had no idea how to interpret a BEL character and would send back a ""Unknown command or character."" error message. And as the server's input buffer was already full, it would again reply with more BEL characters.

So the printing system would effectively keep screaming ""Whaaat? Whaaaat?"" at the server while the server would yell back ""Shut up! Shut up!"".

This shouting match continued until the printing system finally crashed and just started printing garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, now I knew the cause but how to fix this? Hmm, maybe...

A quick look at the documentation and I'd found what I was looking for. I opened a Telnet connection to the server with the same user, typed a single command ""SET ALARM OFF"" (or whatever the exact command was) which disabled the BEL replies and went to report that the printer problem was no more.",1363,0,1,"The BEL Problem Fifteen years ago or so I was still in the middle of my studies but during the summers I worked tech support for a paper mill.

A tale of disappearing media,"Years ago I used to support video editing systems. This particular system used our hardware with Final Cut Pro on a Mac. We used to get a lot of calls that were really Final Cut Pro problems but ""I can get ahold of you and you know what you're talking about."" This was one of those calls.

Customer was capturing media (from tape, told you it was years ago) and while capturing the drives were flashing like you'd expect and the amount of available space on the drives was going down as you'd expect but when the capture ended the media was offline and the file was nowhere to be found.

Montage of hours of troubleshooting. Remember this is before the days of screen sharing when you had to listen to what the customer said and try to dig out that one little tidbit that clued you in to their mistake.

Eventually it is discovered that the customer is starting every clip name with a period ""."" which, in a Unix like operating system such as the Mac OS makes that file hidden. Final Cut is dutifully ignoring the file, thus media is offline, the file is not showing up in the finder but the space is actually used.

""But dear customer, why are you starting file names with a period?""

""I dunno, seemed like a good idea.""

Keyboard broken?,"I have another short and funny story for you guys.
One day a colleague called me and told me as soon as he types something it’s being deleted. 

I wanted to see what he was talking about and connected remotely (He worked in the same building like me, but two levels higher). Same. When I typed something it was instantly deleted up to the point there was nothing left to delete. At some point I had no idea, what the reason could be so I assumed there was something hardware related. 

So I set out and went up to him. Just as I walked though the door I identified the problem.
He had his mobile phone on the desk - but not just on the desk - one corner was directly on the backspace button!

When you fail to apply critical thinking and it costs 1500 dollars.,"So I worked for a point of sale company.

"I Need a Second Monitor, For Mail Merge","Meant to post some tales for a while, used to work IT in a call center that accepted pament for other companies. That's a bit vague enough to not get me in trouble. The whole operation was the kind of place you go into every day and are genuinely surprised they isn't a massive raid. 

Anyway, one of my favorite issues was a user we'll call Aurora, one of three administrative assistants to a director we will call Matt. And before you have any real sympathy for her, she was in her 30s and has a 4-yr degree for administrative assistant.

Before I drive in, the IT department is a 4-man team, a boss and three subordinates. Our boss has a ""unique"" background, with fast food management and a 2yr ITT style computer programming degree. I have a 4yr Information Systems &amp; Operations Management degree. He is at best a good IT guy, someone you call when your system isn't working. Open a shop, build your small business a web page, get you through basic tech support. Which is what he was hired to do. And then the company grew, rapidly. He managed to drop enough jargon to sound like he had subject mastery, and was very pliable. A people pleaser. Someone who just wanted to come to work, fix people's problems, be liked, do his job, keep his nose down, and rinse, lather, repeat until retirement.

In no way was he a CIO, he didn't have the management background, the skills, the understanding, or the desire. For as much as I hated him when I left for how absolutely insane the job had become. It took a long time to look back and realize that the real issue was, he was a 20 something kid, who wanted to make some money, hired to do a job and then thrown into a position he didn't want and couldn't handle, and didn't know what to do. He was trapped. 

I tried to help him. I really, sincerely did. I accepted that I was going to effectively need to spend a large amount of effort getting him, and keeping him, up to speed. Trying to explain everything I had learned (and put myself in a debt hole to get) in a totally different 4yr degree program. And he at least said as much, that we were bassakward. I had his job and he had mine.

He was a Bs and C's programmer, good, but ""agile"" in every negative connotation of that word. Not Agile as in the methodology, but agile in every criticism ever leveraged against agile developers. In the sense of bang it out, make it ""work,"" don't waste time validating and documenting, and move on to something else, ""good code documents itself!"" 

That could go into it's own story, and I'm getting long winded already. Short version, this happened while he was still accepting help, heads ups, and hadn't checked out of the whole situation.

So anyway, into the story.

Aurora is tasked with sending receipts for payments if the customer has requested one. Every day she gets a file emailed to her, in a delimited format. Should be a simple open in excel, slight clean up, save, run a mail merge. A fairly quick process.

This is also at a point in which we have just gone through a major monitor swap out, CRT to LCD, and while we have a closet full of CRTs that we could have handed back out like candy, if only more than a few computers in the building supported a second monitor, of course the user wants an LCD, and also has a computer that won't support a second monitor.

Then came the phone call, which boiled down to ""Hi, I need a second LCD monitor, Matt said it was okay.""

""Okay, and why are you needing a second monitor?""

""Mail merge, it just takes me forever to do the receipt letters with only one screen.""

""R-i-g-h-t. Okay, I can come over to your desk and see what your process is so I can document how this will help.""

""Matt said it was okay.""

""I understand that, but we still need to demonstrate a business need for the expense.""

""Uh, well, I already ran the letters today, you'll have to wait until tomorrow. And I don't understand what the big deal is, Matt said it was okay, so I don't understand why you won't just get me a second monitor. But fine, whatever, see you tomorrow. *CLICK*""

User is know to be a PITA, Matt is a known PITA. So I document carefully, send a message to my boss about the request and the plan to document the need. And bring up the most obvious question, ""we have a letter vendor, why are we actively printing and mailing receipts when there is a pre-formed letter in the system that can be requested and sent through the letter vendor?""

So, next morning, knowing when she gets the report, I pop over to her desk, ""oh, I don't have time to do those now, I have these other reports to work on.""

""Okay, well, just give me a call when you are ready to start on those and I'll come right over."" 

Whole day, no call, so at 4pm I call her, voicemail.

Next morning, first thing, call her. ""Hey, what happened, I thought you were going to call me when you were going to run letters.""

""Oh, I told Matt what you said and that I really just couldn't do them since you wouldn't get me a monitor. He said he'd take it up with your boss during the staff meeting.""

""Oh, okay. Thanks for letting me know.""

*Grumble, grumble, grumble*

Emailed my boss a heads up, included a quote for the second monitor and a new computer, as her's was a bit of a clunker (not a ""bad"" machine, but very low spec, older, but more than enough for her job description), and adding a dual display video card would have been a bit pointless, sort of like a pimp my ride where the car is shot but they add in a bunch of cool tech. 

Got the expected ""WTF?! Thanks for the heads up.""

Staff meeting occurs, I find out later that before it could even start, Matt began screaming at my boss that I ""refused to help Aurora and now she can't do her job."" Boss is able to fire back with a total of equipment needed, and that we were trying to simply document the business need, which she had refused, in order to justify the expense. And that, furthermore, we were a bit confused about why this issue was an issue, as not only should she not need a second monitor to do that, but that he couldn't understand in the first place how this was a task she performed anyway. Why aren't we requesting the letter in the system with every other letter.

Cue hot headed curse laden rant from Matt about how stupid and useless IT was, how his department makes all the money we were ""so worried"" about spending, and how utterly ridiculous it was to have to fight to get a stupid monitor from us given how much money was wasted by IT. 

Basically this was how every staff meeting went, what should have been a couple hours, ended up being an all day boxing match. Each department head trying to find someone else to blame, or trying to disappear into the carpet. Save Matt, the undisputed champion of blame and shame.

Ultimately, Aurora is told to call us the next time she runs letters so ""stupid IT can fill out a form and check a box or whatever.""

So she does, I go over. 

She. Is. Not. Doing. A. Mail. Merge.

She, opening the file in Excel, is taking a letter saved in one file and creating a new document, hand counting rows in Excel (I wish I were kidding), copying and then pasting her saved ""template"" mail merge letter into the new document until she has as many pages as her count. Then she goes through, manually changing the date on each letter, and hand retyping every single bit of the file data into the letter. Clicking back and forth between Word and Excel to do so.

First name, last name, address line 1, address line 2, city, state, zip, our account number, client name, client account number, first name, last name for greeting, account previous balance, payment amount, account balance.

For hundreds of letters.

Then deleting one of three paragraphs, and copying and pasting account balance again if necessary (paragraphs are effectively your account is paid in full, your account was paid in settlement, your account has a balance remaining. 

Did I mention, hundreds of letters.

Then going back through and manually typing Mr/Mrs for the name prefix. 

Again, for those in the back, FOR HUNDREDS OF LETTERS. And by best guess, the prefix wasn't in the file she received. Kim is a MRS, Sam is a MR, and D'Nesha or Rudra is whatever she felt like. You get the idea, she's just randomly getting it right or wrong, and not caring. 

Then printing them out, not on company letterhead, not even the cheap stuff we had for the times that we needed to ""send an official letter"" (but not in a fine letterhead needed way), but instead on plain white paper, so no return address or any indication the receipt wasn't something someone just typed up on their own computer.

Then hand folding them, despite the 1/3 folding machine.

Then she took the stack and hand typed Avery style address labels. One. At. A. Time. Running a 30-up sheet of labels through the laser printer 30 times. For hundreds of labels. Labeling each envelope as she went. One run for the return address, one for the mailing address. 

Oh yes, you read that correctly. She didn't grab the nice pre-printed company envelopes, she didn't grab the cheap company pre-printed envelopes, she didn't use the windowed statement envelopes and just adjust her letter format to show the information in the windows, she used plain white envelopes.

Then postage metered them, all of them. Leaving them unsealed. 

Why, oh why, unsealed you ask? Because then they were put on Matt's desk for review. Because Matt thought it was ridiculous and wasteful to send letters unless they were ""warranted."" What was warranted, well, that was up to him to decide. Some customers got a letter for every payment, some only for final payments, some never got a letter. So he went through and whittled the stack down from hundreds of letters to whatever he thought was appropriate. Trashed the ""un-warranted"" letters and envelopes, and handed the ""warranted"" letters back to Aurora.

Who promptly taped the returned letters shut, and left for the post office at 3:45pm. Dropped the mail off before collection, and then went and ran any other errands that he needed her to run, eventually getting back to the office at some point after 5pm.

And, if you haven't caught it yet, he never noticed they had already been run through the postage machine, so the postage he thought he was saving the company, was literally being thrown away. Not to mention this task, was about 80% of her day. And we were paying her mileage, for using her personal vehicle to go to the post office, separate from the other employee who also went to the post office, and collected mileage. And we were ending up paying her overtime because she didn't clock out until 5:30-6pm. 

I asked for the criteria Matt was using to choose warranted vs unwarranted letters. Never heard back.

I modified the file she received (adding a field to generate a letter type for the three paragraphs selection), created a proper mail merge template (in two formats, one for window envelope and one for cheap company pre-printed envelope) including conditional statements to parse the letter type field and include the appropriate paragraph, made a proper label printing template for use on the cheap company pre-print envelope so label sheets (except when reused due to partial prints) would run through the printer just once (so much explained about why her printer needed a maintenance kit all the time), pointed out that there was a machine to fold the letters, explained to her (shock/horror/surprise/amusement) that ""no, just because you don't put a metered letter in the mail, that doesn't mean the postage wasn't used"" (""but, like it's a barcode, don't they like have to scan it to charge us?"").

I literally made it near idiot proof to do her job. I made it take a few minutes instead of her whole day.

And what, oh what do you think this got me. A ""thank you,"" a pat on the back, high fives, appreciation for saving the company money, brownie points?

No. It got me told to order her a new computer, two brand new monitors, and tasked with fixing the file she received, setting up her new computer and monitors, and told to never do that again.

You see, Matt didn't appreciate that I dared to ask about his ""warranted"" vs ""unwarranted"" criteria, found it completely inappropriate that I would tell his employee how to do her job, was absolutely foaming at the mouth by the time he got to the shear incompetence of my comment about postage, virtually murderous that I had the audacity to suggest anything about his processes that I so clearly was too stupid to understand (using letter vendor), and filled with righteous fury that I should be fired immediately for insubordination. 

My boss, blindsided, saw the writing on the wall. He either gets what he wants or this becomes a never ending war.

So, she got her second monitor, a new computer for it, a ""fixed"" file, a ton more maintenance kits for her printer, and to keep doing what she was doing.

And I got to keep my job.

In the sense of bang it out, make it ""work,"" don't waste time validating and documenting, and move on to something else, ""good code documents itself!"" 

That could go into it's own story, and I'm getting long winded already. Short version, this happened while he was still accepting help, heads ups, and hadn't checked out of the whole situation.

So anyway, into the story.

Aurora is tasked with sending receipts for payments if the customer has requested one. Every day she gets a file emailed to her, in a delimited format. Should be a simple open in excel, slight clean up, save, run a mail merge. A fairly quick process.

This is also at a point in which we have just gone through a major monitor swap out, CRT to LCD, and while we have a closet full of CRTs that we could have handed back out like candy, if only more than a few computers in the building supported a second monitor, of course the user wants an LCD, and also has a computer that won't support a second monitor.

Then came the phone call, which boiled down to ""Hi, I need a second LCD monitor, Matt said it was okay.""

""Okay, and why are you needing a second monitor?""

""Mail merge, it just takes me forever to do the receipt letters with only one screen.""

""R-i-g-h-t. Okay, I can come over to your desk and see what your process is so I can document how this will help.""

""Matt said it was okay.""

""I understand that, but we still need to demonstrate a business need for the expense.""

""Uh, well, I already ran the letters today, you'll have to wait until tomorrow. And I don't understand what the big deal is, Matt said it was okay, so I don't understand why you won't just get me a second monitor. But fine, whatever, see you tomorrow. *CLICK*""

User is know to be a PITA, Matt is a known PITA. So I document carefully, send a message to my boss about the request and the plan to document the need. And bring up the most obvious question, ""we have a letter vendor, why are we actively printing and mailing receipts when there is a pre-formed letter in the system that can be requested and sent through the letter vendor?""

So, next morning, knowing when she gets the report, I pop over to her desk, ""oh, I don't have time to do those now, I have these other reports to work on.""

""Okay, well, just give me a call when you are ready to start on those and I'll come right over."" 

Whole day, no call, so at 4pm I call her, voicemail.

Next morning, first thing, call her. ""Hey, what happened, I thought you were going to call me when you were going to run letters.""

""Oh, I told Matt what you said and that I really just couldn't do them since you wouldn't get me a monitor. He said he'd take it up with your boss during the staff meeting.""

""Oh, okay. Thanks for letting me know.""

*Grumble, grumble, grumble*

Emailed my boss a heads up, included a quote for the second monitor and a new computer, as her's was a bit of a clunker (not a ""bad"" machine, but very low spec, older, but more than enough for her job description), and adding a dual display video card would have been a bit pointless, sort of like a pimp my ride where the car is shot but they add in a bunch of cool tech. 

Got the expected ""WTF?! Thanks for the heads up.""

Staff meeting occurs, I find out later that before it could even start, Matt began screaming at my boss that I ""refused to help Aurora and now she can't do her job."" Boss is able to fire back with a total of equipment needed, and that we were trying to simply document the business need, which she had refused, in order to justify the expense. And that, furthermore, we were a bit confused about why this issue was an issue, as not only should she not need a second monitor to do that, but that he couldn't understand in the first place how this was a task she performed anyway. Why aren't we requesting the letter in the system with every other letter.

Cue hot headed curse laden rant from Matt about how stupid and useless IT was, how his department makes all the money we were ""so worried"" about spending, and how utterly ridiculous it was to have to fight to get a stupid monitor from us given how much money was wasted by IT. 

Basically this was how every staff meeting went, what should have been a couple hours, ended up being an all day boxing match. Each department head trying to find someone else to blame, or trying to disappear into the carpet. Save Matt, the undisputed champion of blame and shame.

Ultimately, Aurora is told to call us the next time she runs letters so ""stupid IT can fill out a form and check a box or whatever.""

So she does, I go over. 

She. Is. Not. Doing. A. Mail. Merge.

She, opening the file in Excel, is taking a letter saved in one file and creating a new document, hand counting rows in Excel (I wish I were kidding), copying and then pasting her saved ""template"" mail merge letter into the new document until she has as many pages as her count. Then she goes through, manually changing the date on each letter, and hand retyping every single bit of the file data into the letter. Clicking back and forth between Word and Excel to do so.

First name, last name, address line 1, address line 2, city, state, zip, our account number, client name, client account number, first name, last name for greeting, account previous balance, payment amount, account balance.

For hundreds of letters.

Then deleting one of three paragraphs, and copying and pasting account balance again if necessary (paragraphs are effectively your account is paid in full, your account was paid in settlement, your account has a balance remaining. 

Did I mention, hundreds of letters.

Then going back through and manually typing Mr/Mrs for the name prefix. 

Again, for those in the back, FOR HUNDREDS OF LETTERS. And by best guess, the prefix wasn't in the file she received. Kim is a MRS, Sam is a MR, and D'Nesha or Rudra is whatever she felt like. You get the idea, she's just randomly getting it right or wrong, and not caring. 

Then printing them out, not on company letterhead, not even the cheap stuff we had for the times that we needed to ""send an official letter"" (but not in a fine letterhead needed way), but instead on plain white paper, so no return address or any indication the receipt wasn't something someone just typed up on their own computer.

Then hand folding them, despite the 1/3 folding machine.

Then she took the stack and hand typed Avery style address labels. One. At. A. Time. Running a 30-up sheet of labels through the laser printer 30 times. For hundreds of labels. Labeling each envelope as she went. One run for the return address, one for the mailing address. 

Oh yes, you read that correctly. She didn't grab the nice pre-printed company envelopes, she didn't grab the cheap company pre-printed envelopes, she didn't use the windowed statement envelopes and just adjust her letter format to show the information in the windows, she used plain white envelopes.

Then postage metered them, all of them. Leaving them unsealed. 

Why, oh why, unsealed you ask? Because then they were put on Matt's desk for review. Because Matt thought it was ridiculous and wasteful to send letters unless they were ""warranted."" What was warranted, well, that was up to him to decide. Some customers got a letter for every payment, some only for final payments, some never got a letter. So he went through and whittled the stack down from hundreds of letters to whatever he thought was appropriate. Trashed the ""un-warranted"" letters and envelopes, and handed the ""warranted"" letters back to Aurora.

Who promptly taped the returned letters shut, and left for the post office at 3:45pm. Dropped the mail off before collection, and then went and ran any other errands that he needed her to run, eventually getting back to the office at some point after 5pm.

And, if you haven't caught it yet, he never noticed they had already been run through the postage machine, so the postage he thought he was saving the company, was literally being thrown away. Not to mention this task, was about 80% of her day. And we were paying her mileage, for using her personal vehicle to go to the post office, separate from the other employee who also went to the post office, and collected mileage. And we were ending up paying her overtime because she didn't clock out until 5:30-6pm. 

I asked for the criteria Matt was using to choose warranted vs unwarranted letters. Never heard back.

I modified the file she received (adding a field to generate a letter type for the three paragraphs selection), created a proper mail merge template (in two formats, one for window envelope and one for cheap company pre-printed envelope) including conditional statements to parse the letter type field and include the appropriate paragraph, made a proper label printing template for use on the cheap company pre-print envelope so label sheets (except when reused due to partial prints) would run through the printer just once (so much explained about why her printer needed a maintenance kit all the time), pointed out that there was a machine to fold the letters, explained to her (shock/horror/surprise/amusement) that ""no, just because you don't put a metered letter in the mail, that doesn't mean the postage wasn't used"" (""but, like it's a barcode, don't they like have to scan it to charge us?"").

I literally made it near idiot proof to do her job. I made it take a few minutes instead of her whole day.

And what, oh what do you think this got me. A ""thank you,"" a pat on the back, high fives, appreciation for saving the company money, brownie points?

No. It got me told to order her a new computer, two brand new monitors, and tasked with fixing the file she received, setting up her new computer and monitors, and told to never do that again.

You see, Matt didn't appreciate that I dared to ask about his ""warranted"" vs ""unwarranted"" criteria, found it completely inappropriate that I would tell his employee how to do her job, was absolutely foaming at the mouth by the time he got to the shear incompetence of my comment about postage, virtually murderous that I had the audacity to suggest anything about his processes that I so clearly was too stupid to understand (using letter vendor), and filled with righteous fury that I should be fired immediately for insubordination. 

My boss, blindsided, saw the writing on the wall. He either gets what he wants or this becomes a never ending war.

So, she got her second monitor, a new computer for it, a ""fixed"" file, a ton more maintenance kits for her printer, and to keep doing what she was doing.

And I got to keep my job. While effectively wearing a target on my back and walking through a gun range."

Bits &amp; Bytes,"I was working on a transcription project where data was being replicated from one city to the other and because of the high change rate, it had to be done asynchronously.

I asked him, before asking anything else, if he could make or receive calls from any other number. He assured me that he couldn't, that he was using his brother's phone to call me, and it was the dumbest question he ever heard. He spent an hour yelling and complaining. Finally, he said that he had to deal with my ""stupidity"" all while his town was being rebuilt. I probed into what he could have meant by that... It turned out a bad storm hit his town... Causing a tree to fall (you guessed it) into his doctor's office.

I said I was going to test call his phone to see if my call would go through... He said ""You can't. I'm using that phone to talk to you.""

I asked ""I thought you were using your brother's phone?""

""I never said that.""


He did say that. Three or four times. I guess he just assumed the doctor's office was going to set a tarp over the damage and take his urgent call. Googled his town later, looked at the news, the doctor he urgently needed to contact was the town dentist."
Top of modem has been stolen!!!!!!!!,"First post, be gentle.

I used to work tech support for a British ISP.

One day I got a call from a panicked customer who told me that someone stole the top half of her modem. Now English is my second language, and even though I'm fairly confident in my English my first thought was that the lady was using some form of slang.

It was years ago so it might not be verbatim but the conversation vent something like this:

Me: What do you mean someone stole the top of your modem?

OL(old lady): I mean my modem was fine when I left the house and when I was back the top of the modem was gone!!!

Me: Do you see any wires coming out of the modem?

OL: No, the top half is just missing.

Me: (This is verbatim) Ma'am I don't understand the modem doesn't have a top or bottom half, it's one solid box, someone would have had to break in to your house, saw the modem in half and take the top part, but leave everything else in the house?

OL: I don't know

Now I was thinking ""maybe she's thinking about something else""

Me: Ma'am can you go to your computer and try to go to any website?

OL: Is BBC ok? (*British Broadcasting Corporation, not the other BBC*).

Me: Sure.

OL: Yes I'm on their page now.

Me: Ok, that means you still have internet. Can you go to the modem and see if there are any lights on?

OL: Yes, give me a minute.

OL: Oh... it got knocked over... -click-

Yeah. The OL couldn't see the top of the modem and immediately assumed someone stole it, even though it just fell over on it's back side.",1784,0,1,"Top of modem has been stolen!!!!!!!! First post, be gentle.

My phone has no WiFi,"Here a short story from my everyday fun:

Besides other IT coordination stuff I’m doing some IT support for my colleagues in a German company but with English as main communication language, because we are a multicultural company (this is important to know for my story, and you must know that WiFi is called WLAN in German).

One day I got a call from a colleague telling me, her phone has no WiFi. Her office buddy’s phone has WiFi (same phone model) but she can’t find it on her phone. I asked her what the system language on her phone was and she said German.

Well there we had it. I asked her if she could find “WLAN” in her settings. She said yes. Mmmmhhh...

I never thought I’d have to explain someone that WiFi and WLAN is the same thing... But honestly these are the conversations that make my day!",320,0,1,"My phone has no WiFi Here a short story from my everyday fun:

Microsoft Mail bane to my existence,"So with the pandemic going on and more people working from home, I’ve been tasked with moving people over to laptops. A couple of weeks ago I get a request to setup the laptop for a user and their needs. Nothing special aside from having Office 365, Chrome and remote control software.

Now this particular user for some reason keeps using Microsoft Mail even though I had setup Outlook for them and I did not configure Mail for them so they initially set it up.  User comes in the other day to pickup laptop and I get an email from an assistant saying their email is not setup with a prompt to setup. Seeing how I know this user initially is using Microsoft Mail and I didn’t configure it for them, I reply back to make sure the user is running Outlook and not Microsoft Mail as I knew that’s what she’s done in the past. I tasked the assistant to check one thing for me and she says it is not working in a reply.

So now I call back the user and instruct her on how I connect to her so I can see what is going on.  Sure enough the user is running Microsoft Mail. I then tell her how I know you don’t know any better but I specially asked the assistant to check that you are running Outlook rather than Mail and they fail to follow simple instructions.

Cue the next day. I get an email from another user that all her notes are missing from Outlook after I had to reinstall OS from scratch after a failed update.  I detail a link on how to open up Notes in Outlook and thought that was it. I then get another reply saying she can’t do signatures now too. At this point this is where I see the tag line in her reply message, “Sent from Mail for Windows 10.”  This wouldn’t be so bad if the fact that many years ago she would have been the technical contact for computer issues.",164,0,1,"Microsoft Mail bane to my existence So with the pandemic going on and more people working from home, I’ve been tasked with moving people over to laptops.

The pound sign,"I had a ticket come through yesterday to help a gentlemen having issues with his email on his iPhone. We recently migrated to a new exchange server so calls for email issues were plentiful. 

Me: Good afternoon sir, I heard you were having email issues on your phone. Do you have time for me to help you?
Sir: Yes yes, give me a minute to pull over. Don’t go to fast, I am an old man and don’t do technology well. 

I knew this was going to be an exciting call. 

I begin walking him through to delete old account and set up new exchange server account. 
I told him to put in his email and then gave him his new password xyz#abc (not actual password but in this format). He tells me it keeps saying password is invalid. After three attempts I told him to give me a moment and check that I had the right password (even though I knew it was right).
I gave him the password again and again said it out phonetically so there was no confusion xyz#abc Xray, Yankee, Zulu pound sign Alpha Bravo Charlie. I told him to repeat it back to me as he typed it. Invalid password again. I am now thinking I am going to be really pissed if I have to drive to his office to fix his phone. I used the “pound sign” instead of “hashtag” thinking he wouldn’t know what a hashtag was. 
I ask him, sir, are you typing pound, hitting the pound key, or selecting the pound symbol? He says, yes I am bringing up the phone and hitting the pound sign then go back and continue to type my password. 

No sir, you need to hit the “123” button then the “up arrow” then the pound sign on the keyboard. 
Sir: it worked that time and brought me into my email.

Never trust your client. Ever.,"I have been working for a near 3 years at a call center providing IT support so I am still quite fairly new but I learned quick. During the beginning we go over a lot of training over some of the software we use, major/minor troubleshooting, resolves, call taking, how-to, etc etc... During a week of training for remote user support, I was with someone who taught me a golden rule. Never trust your client/caller ever.

This has always been on my mind to make sure I always understand the full story and asking correct questions before diving in. But sometimes... I give in and trust the caller to shave a few minutes off a call or sometimes simply because it makes sense to.

Never again.

Normal day, normal calls. One call comes in, it was transferred from one of my colleagues who was training someone. *Lady* tells me the following even before being introduced after being transferred:

Lady: ""I cannot type at all and its not working, My system is frozen and my monitor is not responding""  
Me to myself: here we go... what the hell is she even talking about.  
Me: ""Hi ma'am, I'll be taking over this call moving forward. What exactly do you mean you cannot type?""  
Lady: ""It's just not working, I type and its not working, the previous guy told me to unplug my monitor and reboot test it, didn't work, plug the monitor back in and its still just not working""  
Me to myself: what the hell kind of troubleshooting is that? What wasn't I told from the previous agent, oh my god this is going to be a long one.  
Me: ""Can you click on the-""  
Lady: ""NO I CANT EVEN CLICK""

First of all, she was using a laptop that was connected to their monitor. Normal stuff, they just couldn't do anything, we unplug the monitor and had them use the laptop as normal. I told them to just log into the system with the laptop keyboard and mouse. It worked. We got in, got them connected and I remoted on to see what the hell they were doing with this monitor shenanigans.

Immediately I get a key test running, they test out their external keyboard and no keys are registering. Device manager showed no external mouse or keyboard connected. Nothing in windows settings &gt; devices either.

We plug the monitor back in to see what all of the monitor shenanigans was about because she was telling me how it had something to do with the monitor because of the last agent that was helping them...

I find out they had their keyboard and mouse connected to the actual monitor running as kind of like a docking station. Magically, the keyboard and mouse show up windows settings &gt; devices as a COMBO. (one USB for both devices... shenanigans if you ask me)

Key test again, keyboard doesn't work. Mouse is working now(???). Had them unplug the USB from their monitor which took a while cause they couldn't find it... And had them plug in directly to their laptop. Mouse worked, but not keyboard.

What the hell? I decide well, maybe its something with the drivers... or the keyboard is dead?

Me: ""Does the keyboard usually emit any light at all?""  
Lady: ""No""  
Me: ""By chance does your keyboard run off of batteries?""  
Lady: ""Yea it has batteries but changing them didn't fix it""  
Me: ""Is everything in correctly?""  
Lady: ""Yes""  
Me: ""Could we swap out the batteries again maybe? Maybe we got one with no juice in it left""  
Few minutes go by...

Lady: ""Its still not working, only the mouse works.""

OK I guess I can't get much more information from that. I have to kind of *trust* them on this one. I won't even bother asking them for the model because they really sound like they wouldn't know. I was really over the day and wanted to get this call over with, fix it, move on.

I start looking at drivers, uninstall, reboot, reinstall, same issue, took a further look to see if for whatever reason the keyboard had internal storage, maybe for whatever reason it was being blocked by our system policies... whatever.

We're pretty deep into this call given it takes a lot of time for them to reboot, test things, the occasional ""brb"" or ""hold on real quick"" and even the ""no I don't know"" that makes our lives a bit harder.

What could it even be? I was honestly just about to tell them that hey were SOL here, lets get you a new keyboard.

Lady was fiddling around for a while in the middle of looking at everything and me being completely stumped and about to send them documents for a keyboard replacement.

Lady: ""Oh you know what, the nub of the battery is supposed to be on the spring right?""  
*(the nub by the way, hahahahaha)*  
Me: ""No, definitely not, its supposed to be the other way around.""  
*facepalm*

Keyboard now works like a charm.

Sometimes we overlook the simple things because we put too much trust into our client. 

The golden rule: never trust your client ever.

The mute button is your friend,"Not long after Y2K, I was working for a credit card company supporting their payment processing center. The whole company was huge, multiple thousands of employees, but our little branch was a modest hundred or so, and was located across the country from the main branches (which were in San Francisco, if I recall correctly).

Payment processing was conceptually simple, if technically complex. Customers send in checks. Thirty or forty people open envelopes and scan checks. Another twenty people read the scans and verify amounts. And I mostly sit around waiting for my favorite users to call.

It was the weekend. I’d started my shift with the usual calls (lead operator fatfingered her password again, somebody managed to get an envelope into the check scanner and was afraid to open the machine to clear the jam, etc), and was settling down to start rotating tapes in the backup queue, when the phone rang. The lead operator reported, “Nothing is working.”

I knew her. Nice lady, smart, about as technical as a Labrador retriever. So I headed over to see what she meant. I hurried, because she’d sounded fairly alarmed.

When I reached the center, everybody was standing around talking. They looked at me like I was a movie star or something- I mean, they all stopped talking and stared, with hope and joy on their faces. It was eerie.

The lead showed me her computer, which was supposed to be tracking progress on the company WAN. It was connected to the LAN, but the WAN was down.

I jogged back to the server room, phoning my boss to warn him. He was in his car by the time I’d reached the server room. Where the WAN showed no problems.

I called the NOC group in San Francisco. They eventually answered, listened to my report, and told me, “Yeah, hang on, Andrew’s in charge of that.” (sound effect of somebody tapping his phone but not quite pressing the mute button).

Andrew's voice came on in the background of the call. “Vox Popsicle? He’s an arrogant bastard, I don’t want to talk to him.”

I replied, “Look, you don’t have to like me, but I have fifty people making ten bucks an hour not working due to the WAN.”

Immediate sound effect of the mute button actually being pressed.

They had us reconnected in about forty minutes.

I told my boss about it; I thought it was funny. What a faceless NOC guy thought about me doesn’t bother me. My boss was less amused. I never heard what happened to Andrew, but my boss was a former military drill sergeant, and could tear strips off of you without raising his voice or swearing.

I did, however, learn what caused the outage. Andrew came in on the weekend, looked around the San Francisco office and saw no workers, so decided to take down the servers that took our data. The network was still up, so our WAN was technically still working, but the destination servers were offline. He figured that since the big office was empty, nobody would be using the servers.

"Technician who yelled ""YOU PIECE OF SH*T,"" over the phone got fired","Backstory: French colleague (We're an international company) called me and asked me if I knew how to make a certain software package work on a server. It was something complicated and required some experience with the product. I said that I'd take the call, but my French isn't super duper. I can understand it fine most of the time, but sometimes I'm looking for the right word to say and that can make me go ""Oui uhhhh c'est un uhmmm probleme avec le serveur et uhh..."".

Here's how the call went (translated, of course). 

Me: Tea - Client: C

&gt;Tea: Tea speaking  
&gt;  
&gt;C: Ah, another one? Okay, you're going to fix my problem right?  
&gt;  
&gt;Tea: Good afternoon to you too, sir. With what may I be of service?  
&gt;  
&gt;C: Fix your shit software and make sure it works. I've already been talking to your colleague and he can't make it work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tea: Whoa, okay, calm down, I'll -  
&gt;  
&gt;C: Here's the fucking Teamviewer ID

So rather than make a fuss about it, I just logged in to see what I could do. The software was installed, but nothing had been programmed yet. Mind you, we normally only sell this software to people who have followed training to make it work.

&gt;Tea: Ah yes, I see. Nothing is programmed yet.   
&gt;  
&gt;C: Yeah? Well, go on then. Program it. Make sure it works.

In the meanwhile I hear him chatting with the client and some other people, laughing and making jokes while being incredibly rude to me. I make a note in the ticket. 

Because I couldn't be assed with dealing with anymore shit, I figured I'd just program it for him (doesn't take me that long) and then report it to sales. 

As I was programming it, it required me to reset certain settings on another software on the same server, one he had already 'programmed' himself. As I wanted to click on the ""YES"" button to confirm that I wanted to do a reset, he started shouting.

&gt;C: W-What're you doing?  
&gt;  
&gt;Tea: ...A reset.  
&gt;  
&gt;C: Wh- No. NO. Don't DO IT.   
&gt;  
&gt;Tea: We need to reset it so I can reconfigure some things. It'd take too long to program everything again by hand, and the default settings will make it go fast-  
&gt;  
&gt;C: NO. DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME TO PROGRAM THIS?

At this point I couldn't care any less, so I just hit the yes button and there it went. Then I got a bunch of swear words thrown at my head. In French, of course.

&gt;C: PUTAIN. YOU PIECE OF SHIT. YOU DOG. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE (it went on for a while)

So I just muted the call, finished configuring it, showed him it worked and he just hung up on me without saying thank you or sorry.

I made a call to sales, he requested the recording of the call and after listening to it he called the technician's boss.

He got fired because this apparently wasn't the first time he's been rude in general. He's been rude to co-workers, clients, his boss, etc. The last drop was that he also was super rude to us, their supplier.

I can understand it fine most of the time, but sometimes I'm looking for the right word to say and that can make me go ""Oui uhhhh c'est un uhmmm probleme avec le serveur et uhh..."".

&gt;Tea: Whoa, okay, calm down, I'll -  
&gt;  
&gt;C: Here's the fucking Teamviewer ID

So rather than make a fuss about it, I just logged in to see what I could do. The software was installed, but nothing had been programmed yet. Mind you, we normally only sell this software to people who have followed training to make it work.

&gt;Tea: Ah yes, I see. Nothing is programmed yet.   
&gt;  
&gt;C: Yeah? Well, go on then. Program it. Make sure it works.

Lesson learned"
Tale from a school technology facilitator during Corona," I work as a tech facilitator for a school, and as part of our job responsibility we take helpdesk calls for remote learners. I received a call from a concerned parent trying to figure out how to do an assignment. They assignment sounds like a worksheet that they are supposed to fill out. Easy, right?

The parent sounded pretty competent so I decided to just remote in and see what was up. Embeded in canvas is a google doc that the student can edit and submit. Only problem is that the teacher literally just snipped the pages in so they are un-editable. She requires that students highlight information on the page and answer the questions, only problem being that both are impossible on a picture element in docs.

I read over the assignment instructions and it requests that students use a chrome extension called kami, a pdf annotation tool. So it doesn't even work on the embeded docs file, nor can you save as pdf and submit because there is no option to upload files. 

I had a few ideas on non elegant solutions, but I wanted to hear how the teacher wanted it.

I call up the teacher and put the parent on hold:

Me: ""So, I see this annotation assignment here, what is the proper workflow process to get this assignment done?""

Teach: ""you use kami""

Me: ""yes but that is for *pdfs* not *google documents""*

Teach: ""well that's for them to figure out, other students have submitted the assignment""

Me: ""interesting, so how do you open up kami with google docs?""

Teach: ""I don't know I just see it from my side that they do. I instructed that any students having problems need to get their parents to drive them to school and have the front office staff help them""

Me: ""well I can't figure it out, and I'm a tech facilitator at &lt;school&gt;""

Teach: ""thats on you, *I'm not the tech guy, you are""*

I then call up the front office staff and ask them how they did it. Turns out they would save the document to pdf, open it with kami, annotate, then redownload as a annotated pdf, then take screenshot of the work, then post those screenshots into the google docs page, and then submit. Keep in mind these are middle schoolers and this is a 5 minute worksheet. The front office staff claim they have had upwards of 15 kids come in and have someone explain how to do this, and that many more have called for help.

"The Lucky Buckeye – Part 2 or, let the magic begin","A story from “back in the day,” the day in question was when Novell was king. I was working for a small VAR in a medium sized city. We had an overflow contract with the local school district.

After working in a school system for a short while, it became apparent that the staff feel a need to ask a question that they are afraid for the answer. “How did you fix it?” or “What was wrong?” You can almost see them cringe as they expect an onslaught of techno babble to be coming at them. I truly feel for them.

Now experience had taught me that the only reliable information on the work order was the room number. Everything else was suspect. My modus operandi was to find the room, inquire about the issues, and fix whatever issues they describe. Then I would write-up whatever I did and close the ticket.

Me: Please try printing now.

Lady: It works. What did you do? \[I see her tensing for the reply\]

I do not know if the Buckeye was lucky or not, but it was magic. I carried it with me for quite a while. The Buckeye and the story opened the minds of many school district staff to get the answer to the question that they were dreading, without the techno babble.

"A tale about respect, manners, and how IT fired more than 100 guests","A recent ""Karen"" story I read reminded me that last year I had an encounter of that sort which I didn't post about yet. For your entertainment, here it is.

First a little background info to set the scene:

&amp;#x200B;

Our company HQ building has big conference rooms. Despite not being in the events or hosting business at all, we sometimes rent those out if we don't need them ourselves. Only B2B, we only offer little service but that makes for a fair rate, all usually easy going, not much work and earns a few extra bucks.The day this story took place was one such time: A company that had rented our conference rooms before had booked them again, but this time for a completely different occasion, hence other guests in our house.

Regarding technical equipment and support the rules were simple: We as the host provide you with one high quality projector per room, one HDMI cable, one audio cable if you want to use the room's speaker system, and one wifi voucher for each of the devices people need to present from. Everything other than that is your own business as a guest.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year's autumn, when this happened, both the IT team and our facility department ^((not sure if that's the correct term, not a native speaker - the department who janitors, catering staff etc belong to)) were very short on staff thanks to a bad stomach flu going around. Preparing the conference rooms for renters hasn't been of my duties for years anymore, but due to the staff situation and still knowing how to do it, I helped out. Usually our main janitor prepares the room layout and our internal catering woman stays on standby for the guests, but both were sick. The only option to fill in their positions on short notice was to borrow Lucy, an apprentice from another department. She was fresh from school, had only started her apprenticeship a few weeks ago and didn't mind doing something completely different for a day. Naturally she needed instructing and some help with her newly assigned duties. It took longer than usual, but together we made sure everything is perfectly prepared in time for our guests. Prior to their arrival I had briefed her to call me personally if the guests require any IT help before I had to leave.

Since I passed the conference area on the way through the building a little later on, I checked on Lucy and the guests. Quite a few had already arrived, but everything so far was good, projector and sound worked, she felt comfortable to handle the job, everything fine.

Half an hour passes by, then I receive a first call from Lucy. The guests wanted to know where they could get wifi vouchers. Dang, my bad, forgot to tell her. I sent her to the front desk to fetch one per device the guests need for their presentations.

Ten more minutes pass. Suddenly another call.

&gt;Lucy, sounding strangely nervous: *""Could you please come down? The guests need help with the wifi...""*

Since I'd never interacted with her before today, I couldn't quite place if the tone of her voice indicated a problem, or if she was just a little insecure and stressed now... Something felt off, though.

&gt;Me: *""Sure, don't worry, I'll be there in a few minutes, just gotta finish something real quick.""*

Upon entering the hallway to the conference rooms I could already hear an irritated woman's voice heavily berating somebody. Not a good sign. Worried now, I picked up my pace and turned around the final corner, only to find poor little Lucy cornered by a suited woman in her 40s whose voice I had heard, absolutely barking at her about not delivering what they paid for. Lucy was visibly shaking a little, probably getting close to a panic attack. After hearing my footsteps her eyes immediately made contact with mine, looking anxiously for help.

&gt;Me, sharply: *""Excuse me!""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman: ""***WHAT?*** *Now who the* ***f\*\*\**** *are you?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""I'm from IT and here to help you with the wifi issue Lucy has contacted me about. What can I do for you?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman, still in a very angry tone: *""We were promised wifi vouchers in the lease contract for the room, but* ***SHE*** *-""* pointing her finger directly at Lucy, almost stabbing her in the eye - *""refuses to hand out any!""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lucy, seemingly at the verge of tears now: *""But I... I gave you one for your laptop, your tablet and your guest speaker's laptop...""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman, shouting down on Lucy again: *""AND WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS? We have over 100 people here and EVERYONE needs wifi, you* ***stupid worthless \*\*\*\*****!""*

Those words really hurt and this new, unexpected toxic situation became too much to bear - tears welled up in Lucy's eyes. Before seeing this I already had more than enough of this woman's behavior, but now I snapped. This had to stop.

&gt;Me: ""***HEY! STOP.*** *Calm down. Keep those insults to yourself, where are your manners?! Back off of her, she's just doing her job and following policy!""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman, turning to me, cocky look on her face and maximum disdain in her voice: *""Who do you think you are, telling me what to say or do, huh? And what stupid policy?! We were promised wifi, and that's what we're getting from you.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""The contract clearly states the IT policy for external guests, which -""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman, cutting me off: *""****DON'T. CARE.*** *You two drones are utterly useless and should get* ***fired!*** *Get me the manager in charge,* ***NOW!****""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""Alright. As you wish. Be right back.""*

With that the woman stormed off, back into the conference room. I gestured Lucy to come with me and she immediately followed, glad to get away and barely keeping it together. We made our way around the corner, back to the elevators, when I stopped and put my hand on one of Lucy's shoulders, getting her to look up at me.

&gt;Me: *""I'm so sorry you were treated like that. Are you OK?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lucy nodded and took a deep breath, slowly regaining her composure.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me, continuing walking with her: *""Listen, you don't have to accept this sort of behavior, neither as an apprentice nor as anyone else. Feel free to simply walk away next time and report to a manager.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lucy: *""OK. I will.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""Don't let those hurtful words get to you - forget everything she said, you were doing a great job. Really, I mean it, and am very proud of you standing your ground.""*

We reached the elevators and entered one. I pushed the button to the executive floor.

&gt;Lucy: *""Where are we going now?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""My office. At least, I will. You go fetch a cup of hot chocolate or whatever you like from the machine next to the elevators, it's free. Have a seat on the sofa then. I'll be back in a few minutes.""*

Lucy looked confused, but complied. Meanwhile I went through the adjacent hallway door - and into my office. Since I knew in advance I'd help get the conference room ready due to filling in for the missing sysadmin in my team, but had an important meeting in the afternoon, I had changed from my slacks into jeans (which I keep in my wardrobe for such occasions) earlier and left my suit jacket and tie by my desk. Now I reverted those changes, made a few quick phone calls and returned to Lucy all dressed up. Her eyes grew wide.

&gt;Lucy: *""This question might sound stupid now, sorry, but... who are you exactly?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me, smiling: *""I do work in IT, but I am the CIO. Since so many of my people are sick right now I'm filling in for them. That's why I helped you set up the room instead of Ben, who'd usually do this. And now, since that lovely woman down there asked for management attention, we'll teach her a lesson in respect. Follow me.""*

With that we made our way down to the conference rooms again.

&gt;Me, mockingly straighting my tie and suit jacket: *""Lucy, would you* ***please*** *be so kind to inform our guest that the manager in charge is here now?""*

She grinned and did as requested. Immediately I could hear a faint *""Finally, everything takes too damn long around here!""* before the woman hurried through the door towards me. When she recognized me, she froze in her tracks.

&gt;Me: *""Good morning. My name is &lt;roflcopter-pilot&gt;, I'm the CIO of &lt;company&gt; and therefore the manager in charge regarding your issue, who you demanded to speak.""*

Calmly I walked towards her, reached into my jacket and gave her my business card. The woman took it, but not being able to throw anybody under the bus apparently left her without a plan and speechless.

&gt;Me: *""Now that I got your attention, I have three things to tell you.*  
*One: You stated that you 'were promised wifi' and that you 'want to get what you pay for'. You signed a contract stating that you get wifi access for every device needed for your presentations, which we delivered. We neither can nor will provide access for all attendees of your event. Our network, our rules. Period.*  
*Two: Your condescending, rude tone is bad enough in itself, but verbally abusing and intimidating employees, especially* ***a minor like in this case***, *absolutely won't be tolerated around here! I expect a sincere apology of yours to Lucy and myself.""*

She slowly found the ability to speak again.

&gt;Woman: *""OK, I apologize, that was not very professional of me. But -""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me, interrupting her: *""That's a massive understatement and doesn't sound terribly sincere to me. Furthermore, point three: Verbal assault and intimidation are against our house rules, which we strictly enforce and you agreed to adhere to by signing the rental contract. This alone warrants your personal removal from our premises. Also you apparently invited more than 100 people, which you weren't allowed to do and violates fire code rules, since the maximum room capacity is exactly 100, as stated in the contract. Due to now multiple breaches of contract and said fire code violations I herewith have to ask you and your guests to leave. By the way, according to internal consultation we have not the* ***slightest*** *further interest in renting out our rooms to your company, considering the circumstances. Please gather your people, personal belongings and then leave our premises.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short from here on:

She of course threw a massive hissy fit, questioned my authority some more and needed to be guided out by security. The other people from her company were confused and understandably not amused, but cooperated in a civil manner.

A week later she had her lawyer send us a letter claiming unfair treatment and requesting a refund, which gave our lawyer a big laugh and the opportunity to lay out to their counterpart how they breached the contract in great detail. That was the last we heard from them, thankfully.

Only B2B, we only offer little service but that makes for a fair rate, all usually easy going, not much work and earns a few extra bucks.The day this story took place was one such time: A company that had rented our conference rooms before had booked them again, but this time for a completely different occasion, hence other guests in our house.

Regarding technical equipment and support the rules were simple: We as the host provide you with one high quality projector per room, one HDMI cable, one audio cable if you want to use the room's speaker system, and one wifi voucher for each of the devices people need to present from. Everything other than that is your own business as a guest.

&amp;#x200B;

Last year's autumn, when this happened, both the IT team and our facility department ^((not sure if that's the correct term, not a native speaker - the department who janitors, catering staff etc belong to)) were very short on staff thanks to a bad stomach flu going around. Preparing the conference rooms for renters hasn't been of my duties for years anymore, but due to the staff situation and still knowing how to do it, I helped out. Usually our main janitor prepares the room layout and our internal catering woman stays on standby for the guests, but both were sick. The only option to fill in their positions on short notice was to borrow Lucy, an apprentice from another department. She was fresh from school, had only started her apprenticeship a few weeks ago and didn't mind doing something completely different for a day. Naturally she needed instructing and some help with her newly assigned duties. It took longer than usual, but together we made sure everything is perfectly prepared in time for our guests. Prior to their arrival I had briefed her to call me personally if the guests require any IT help before I had to leave.

Since I passed the conference area on the way through the building a little later on, I checked on Lucy and the guests. Quite a few had already arrived, but everything so far was good, projector and sound worked, she felt comfortable to handle the job, everything fine.

Half an hour passes by, then I receive a first call from Lucy. The guests wanted to know where they could get wifi vouchers. Dang, my bad, forgot to tell her. I sent her to the front desk to fetch one per device the guests need for their presentations.

Ten more minutes pass. Suddenly another call.

&gt;Lucy, sounding strangely nervous: *""Could you please come down? The guests need help with the wifi...""*

Since I'd never interacted with her before today, I couldn't quite place if the tone of her voice indicated a problem, or if she was just a little insecure and stressed now... Something felt off, though.

&gt;Me: *""Sure, don't worry, I'll be there in a few minutes, just gotta finish something real quick.""*

Upon entering the hallway to the conference rooms I could already hear an irritated woman's voice heavily berating somebody. Not a good sign. Worried now, I picked up my pace and turned around the final corner, only to find poor little Lucy cornered by a suited woman in her 40s whose voice I had heard, absolutely barking at her about not delivering what they paid for. Lucy was visibly shaking a little, probably getting close to a panic attack. After hearing my footsteps her eyes immediately made contact with mine, looking anxiously for help.

&gt;Me, sharply: *""Excuse me!""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman: ""***WHAT?*** *Now who the* ***f\*\*\**** *are you?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""I'm from IT and here to help you with the wifi issue Lucy has contacted me about. What can I do for you?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman, still in a very angry tone: *""We were promised wifi vouchers in the lease contract for the room, but* ***SHE*** *-""* pointing her finger directly at Lucy, almost stabbing her in the eye - *""refuses to hand out any!""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lucy, seemingly at the verge of tears now: *""But I... I gave you one for your laptop, your tablet and your guest speaker's laptop...""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman, shouting down on Lucy again: *""AND WHAT ABOUT THE OTHERS? We have over 100 people here and EVERYONE needs wifi, you* ***stupid worthless \*\*\*\*****!""*

Those words really hurt and this new, unexpected toxic situation became too much to bear - tears welled up in Lucy's eyes. Before seeing this I already had more than enough of this woman's behavior, but now I snapped. This had to stop.

&gt;Me: ""***HEY! STOP.*** *Calm down. Keep those insults to yourself, where are your manners?! Back off of her, she's just doing her job and following policy!""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman, turning to me, cocky look on her face and maximum disdain in her voice: *""Who do you think you are, telling me what to say or do, huh? And what stupid policy?! We were promised wifi, and that's what we're getting from you.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""The contract clearly states the IT policy for external guests, which -""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Woman, cutting me off: *""****DON'T. CARE.*** *You two drones are utterly useless and should get* ***fired!*** *Get me the manager in charge,* ***NOW!****""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""Alright. As you wish. Be right back.""*

With that the woman stormed off, back into the conference room. I gestured Lucy to come with me and she immediately followed, glad to get away and barely keeping it together. We made our way around the corner, back to the elevators, when I stopped and put my hand on one of Lucy's shoulders, getting her to look up at me.

&gt;Me: *""I'm so sorry you were treated like that. Are you OK?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lucy nodded and took a deep breath, slowly regaining her composure.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me, continuing walking with her: *""Listen, you don't have to accept this sort of behavior, neither as an apprentice nor as anyone else. Feel free to simply walk away next time and report to a manager.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Lucy: *""OK. I will.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""Don't let those hurtful words get to you - forget everything she said, you were doing a great job. Really, I mean it, and am very proud of you standing your ground.""*

We reached the elevators and entered one. I pushed the button to the executive floor.

&gt;Lucy: *""Where are we going now?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: *""My office. At least, I will. You go fetch a cup of hot chocolate or whatever you like from the machine next to the elevators, it's free. Have a seat on the sofa then. I'll be back in a few minutes.""*

Lucy looked confused, but complied. Meanwhile I went through the adjacent hallway door - and into my office. Since I knew in advance I'd help get the conference room ready due to filling in for the missing sysadmin in my team, but had an important meeting in the afternoon, I had changed from my slacks into jeans (which I keep in my wardrobe for such occasions) earlier and left my suit jacket and tie by my desk. Now I reverted those changes, made a few quick phone calls and returned to Lucy all dressed up. Her eyes grew wide.

&gt;Lucy: *""This question might sound stupid now, sorry, but... who are you exactly?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me, smiling: *""I do work in IT, but I am the CIO. Since so many of my people are sick right now I'm filling in for them. That's why I helped you set up the room instead of Ben, who'd usually do this. And now, since that lovely woman down there asked for management attention, we'll teach her a lesson in respect. Follow me.""*

With that we made our way down to the conference rooms again.

&gt;Me, mockingly straighting my tie and suit jacket: *""Lucy, would you* ***please*** *be so kind to inform our guest that the manager in charge is here now?""*

She grinned and did as requested. Immediately I could hear a faint *""Finally, everything takes too damn long around here!""* before the woman hurried through the door towards me. When she recognized me, she froze in her tracks.

&gt;Me: *""Good morning. My name is &lt;roflcopter-pilot&gt;, I'm the CIO of &lt;company&gt; and therefore the manager in charge regarding your issue, who you demanded to speak.""*

Calmly I walked towards her, reached into my jacket and gave her my business card. The woman took it, but not being able to throw anybody under the bus apparently left her without a plan and speechless.

&gt;Me: *""Now that I got your attention, I have three things to tell you.*  
*One: You stated that you 'were promised wifi' and that you 'want to get what you pay for'. You signed a contract stating that you get wifi access for every device needed for your presentations, which we delivered. We neither can nor will provide access for all attendees of your event. Our network, our rules. Period.*  
*Two: Your condescending, rude tone is bad enough in itself, but verbally abusing and intimidating employees, especially* ***a minor like in this case***, *absolutely won't be tolerated around here! I expect a sincere apology of yours to Lucy and myself.""*

She slowly found the ability to speak again.

&gt;Woman: *""OK, I apologize, that was not very professional of me. But -""*  
&gt;  
&gt;Me, interrupting her: *""That's a massive understatement and doesn't sound terribly sincere to me. Furthermore, point three: Verbal assault and intimidation are against our house rules, which we strictly enforce and you agreed to adhere to by signing the rental contract. This alone warrants your personal removal from our premises. Also you apparently invited more than 100 people, which you weren't allowed to do and violates fire code rules, since the maximum room capacity is exactly 100, as stated in the contract. Due to now multiple breaches of contract and said fire code violations I herewith have to ask you and your guests to leave. By the way, according to internal consultation we have not the* ***slightest*** *further interest in renting out our rooms to your company, considering the circumstances. Please gather your people, personal belongings and then leave our premises.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short from here on:

She of course threw a massive hissy fit, questioned my authority some more and needed to be guided out by security. The other people from her company were confused and understandably not amused, but cooperated in a civil manner.

A week later she had her lawyer send us a letter claiming unfair treatment and requesting a refund, which gave our lawyer a big laugh and the opportunity to lay out to their counterpart how they breached the contract in great detail. That was the last we heard from them, thankfully.

&amp;#x200B;

So many awards in such a quick time, y'all are insane, thank you! While I appreciate the nice gesture, please consider donating to a charity instead of buying awards on reddit next time, though.

The curious tale of dead CMOS battery and Dell Defaults,"Just a quicky

The local water district had a power outage and the venerable DELL windows 7 machine which does all their quickbooks and billing and such is in a reboot cycle.  I get called in .. being the local geek.  Also I help with the pump computers at the plant from time to time.  This is small time rural stuff.. no IT staff.. no budget

So WTF?  I boot the comp and the date is wrong.  OK .. drive the freaking 20 miles to get a cmos battery load it up.. change the date .. click 'default' settings in the bios ... thinking (like an idiot) that the default settings would be fine to get started on a factory made DELL machine.

Still won't get out of the loop.  I go into advanced recovery mode.. nowt.  I do the hardware checks.. NOWT

I run the full disk check (went to bed and got up) no problemo it says.

WTF!

So thankfully they have an image from last weeks backup (which I made them start doing).  I load a dos prompt.. copy all the files I can find as another backup and re-image the sucker from the backup thinking. OK whatever corruption is on this thing this should work.. does it??

NOPE!

Well fuck.  Then I think.. you idiot.. the only variable here is the BIOS being reset.  I go into the bios .. which is a freaking UI from hell.. no simple old school bios, but expandable links and mouse etc.  I see RAID enabled.  For a single drive simple basic one drive almost 10 year old computer.  I change it from RAID AHCI  to regular AHCI 

the bios bitches at me 'CHANGING THIS VALUE MAY REQUIRE YOU TO RE-INSTALL YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM'.  Well fine with me.. already did that.

Damn thing works right out of the box .. boots up fine.. I recover some files from my manual backup and off it goes.

GRR.. the 'default safe' CMOS settings on this DELL fubared me.  Why did I trust the safe settings? 

Cos i'm an idiot ;)

that's it.

edit: I've come to think that (thanks to u/bootleg_contoso) someone in the distant past installed windows using a the non raid AHCI setting in bios and thus the default didn't work.

Marketing didn't get their way AKA The Day The Earth Stood Still,"Long story short.

Big company ($500M+) part of bigger ($50B) corporation. The first ten plus years I was there we had to help everyone in the company with any technology question they had.

* Don't know how to use your company smart phone? We'll help you figure it out.
* You need to work from home and can't get your laptop to connect to your Wi-Fi?  Sure, we'll waste hours because you keep trying to connect to the neighbor's Wi-Fi instead of your own.
* Quality department guy designs an unscalable and invisible to IT application in Microsoft Access and then moves to a new department?  IT suddenly has to support his work.

Around 2010 there was a big change in corporate leadership.  Word came down that local IT groups are **FORBIDDEN** from supporting any technologies not in the approved corporate IT portfolio.

* Someone comes with a smart phone problem?  Send them to the carrier.
* Someone has problems with their home Wi-Fi. Nope, as long as your laptop connects when plugged into the router/modem the rest is on you.
* You brought in a spare printer from home to hook up to your PC so you don't have to walk across the hall?  Hell no.

Marketing guy gets money approved in his budget for some iPad based app and does an end run on getting approval from local or corporate IT. *added* Marketing got the PO cut, paid the bill and did not go through the formal process of getting their tech project approved through IT channels.  

The app is some graphical product configurator and did not tie into our core business systems.  Any integration was sneaker-ware (manual entry).  The users were internal sales reps and our third party dealers, aka, our problem children.  Marketing and sales launched the new app and we started getting calls. I went to our VP and this conversation ensued.

* **Me** \- We've started getting calls about ""unapproved app"" and I don't have anyone that knows about it.  Should we contact the vendor to get cross trained?
* **VP** \- Under no circumstances are you to assist users with unapproved app. Send them all to marketing guy who did the end run.
* **Me** \- He won't like it and the sales reps won't like it. They will complain to their VPs and their VPs will bring it up in senior staff.
* **VP** \- I don't care and I'll take care of their VPs.

The Lucky Buckeye – Part 1,"A story from “back in the day,” the day in question was when Novell was king. I was working for a small VAN in a medium sized city. We had an overflow contract with the local school district.

One of my first school district projects was to replace a Novell 3x server with a bright shiny new 5x server. The server was housed in what we used to call the Library, but now is referred to as the Media Center.  After spending the best part of two days with the friendly Media Specialist (AKA  Librarian) she rewarded me for my efforts with a Buckeye which she claimed was lucky. For the uninitiated, a Buckeye is a nut. I promptly thanked her and put it in my pocket.

Back at the office I noticed our Lotus Notes Developer (yes that far back in the day) walking between his office and the server room, many times in fact. This drew my curiosity so I went into the server room to look. On a whim, I pulled the Buckeye out of my pocket and tapped it on his server.

Queue the conversation on his last trip from the server room.

Me – Well, me.

Idiots and iPads,"I work for a rather well known optician company, based in Paris.

Right now, we're deploying an iPad-based ""smart mirror"". Basically, you take a picture of a prospective client with it, and a special app lets you show them how they'd look with different kinds of glasses. It also performs other functions. 

All in all, a neat tool, and according to the feedback it's provided a significant increase in sales. 

But. We, that is, the IT team, perform the initial configuration. We set them up carefully to work properly, including enrollment, app setup, etc. Takes about an hour, then we send them off through a transporter to the different shops that are part of the test sample.

Except that for some reason, they decide they want to change the password. Invariably, a few days later they mess up the password and freeze the iPad. And of course instead of asking for help, they follow the procedure to reset the iPad, thus erasing the setup.

So it needs to come back at our main office, where we will set it back up properly. It takes around three or four days usually, with the back and forth through the transporter.


It's happened something like five times in a month, with a sample size of twenty. Let's just say I'm not optimistic regarding the full deployment of this ""toy"". Oh, and a shop managed to lock theirs not once but twice now. And of course I'm the tech with the most experience and usual referent for this project...

Edit because everyone asks about it : there is an MDM in place, but for whatever fucking reason it doesn't redeploy the configuration when users fuck it up.",1570,0,1,"Idiots and iPads I work for a rather well known optician company, based in Paris.

"I know, I installed it.","I've worked in IT for almost 25 years and now am considered a global expert in my specialty. I’m one of the people who made sure that anything on the internet was permanent and had a hand in building a major cloud service.

In the early 2000’s I was already considered an expert and was asked by my employer to present about a product at a bank who had just purchased it. I was part of a team with two other guys, each of us was going to give a technical presentation to the IT department. The first guy had been talking for about five minutes when someone entered the room and things started going downhill. He was heckling us.

“Well, when I was at &lt;insert major retailer&gt;, we had problems with that and blah, blah, blah.”

The guy had the most annoying, nasal, snide voice, just dripping with “I’m going to blather on about how smart I am by putting you down.” GOD, I wanted to punch him, but even worse I had to do my presentation in front of him. Maybe he’d stop after the first guy was finished.

Oh no he didn’t.

The next guy got up, talking about a different but related product and its technical features, and he laid into him, “Well, &lt;insert major retailer&gt; had so much trouble with iSCSI that we had to blah, blah, blah.”

Oh wonderful.

What I \*didn’t\* notice was how the other people in the room were reacting to him. He was getting the side-eye, ESADMF looks, and blatant glares from all the IT guys there. In retrospect, why the manager there didn’t shut him up is still a mystery.

So when my turn came, I decided just to plow through things and endure him. I started talking about my product and sure enough, he HAD to say something.

“Well, at &lt;insert major retailer&gt; we had one of these and it gave us a LOT of trouble with authenticating into Windows domain servers,” This was before Active Directory came out, not relevant to the story but it gives the tech folks of an idea when.

I stood there and listened to him, just nodding along, I can field this one, no sweat.

“I know, I installed it.”

DEAD SILENCE.

“The OS was about 3.2 or 3.3, I think,” I went on, not realizing what had happened, “Now we’re on version 6 and, if I remember right, it was a Windows authentication issue and worked perfectly after a patch.”

Two seconds later it hit me. Oh CRAP! I just shut down the client! But I continued on with my presentation and he left shortly afterwards, before I finished.

All the IT guys came up and apologized, telling me he’d just come over from &lt;insert major retailer&gt; and couldn’t stop talking about how they did things and why it was better. One guy said he was an ass and they couldn’t stand him.

Outside the bank, everyone was laughing and congratulating me for shutting him down, saying he’d stepped in it and stepped in it GOOD. We were almost at lunch when we met the sales guy, who had been on the phone, and the first thing he asked was, “Who’s Joe (not my name)?”

“Me,” I replied, not certain how this was going to go but he shook my hand.

“That was freaking BRILLIANT! I was so mad at that jerk and when you shut him down I jumped up and started punching at the phone yelling, YES! YES! YES! Take THAT arsehole!”

I’ve told that story over and over since, it never gets old and NEVER has happened again.

The next guy got up, talking about a different but related product and its technical features, and he laid into him, “Well, &lt;insert major retailer&gt; had so much trouble with iSCSI that we had to blah, blah, blah.”

Oh wonderful.

What I \*didn’t\* notice was how the other people in the room were reacting to him. He was getting the side-eye, ESADMF looks, and blatant glares from all the IT guys there. In retrospect, why the manager there didn’t shut him up is still a mystery.

So when my turn came, I decided just to plow through things and endure him. I started talking about my product and sure enough, he HAD to say something.

“Well, at &lt;insert major retailer&gt; we had one of these and it gave us a LOT of trouble with authenticating into Windows domain servers,” This was before Active Directory came out, not relevant to the story but it gives the tech folks of an idea when.

I stood there and listened to him, just nodding along, I can field this one, no sweat.

“I know, I installed it.”

DEAD SILENCE.

“The OS was about 3.2 or 3.3, I think,” I went on, not realizing what had happened, “Now we’re on version 6 and, if I remember right, it was a Windows authentication issue and worked perfectly after a patch.”

Two seconds later it hit me. Oh CRAP! I just shut down the client! But I continued on with my presentation and he left shortly afterwards, before I finished.

All the IT guys came up and apologized, telling me he’d just come over from &lt;insert major retailer&gt; and couldn’t stop talking about how they did things and why it was better. One guy said he was an ass and they couldn’t stand him.

Outside the bank, everyone was laughing and congratulating me for shutting him down, saying he’d stepped in it and stepped in it GOOD. We were almost at lunch when we met the sales guy, who had been on the phone, and the first thing he asked was, “Who’s Joe (not my name)?”

“Me,” I replied, not certain how this was going to go but he shook my hand.

“That was freaking BRILLIANT! I was so mad at that jerk and when you shut him down I jumped up and started punching at the phone yelling, YES! YES! YES! Take THAT arsehole!”

I’ve told that story over and over since, it never gets old and NEVER has happened again. I honestly don’t want it to, I’m a professional that takes great pride in my work and he was the total opposite of one. It speaks volumes of their hiring practices that let someone like that get through."
Your software proved our tax fraud so we want a refund.,"This  customer was a small local hotel. I have no idea why they were being investigated, because they were small and not making a ton of money. We got a call from the IRS wanting us to assist them in gaining access to the software and printing out some reports. We bill them for a few hours of work and then get started.

I provided them with the default user and password that comes with the demo. It's a long shot but sometimes customers don't follow our instructions to delete it. The hotel never changed the credentials and the default demo user works. That was easy so let's get to the reports. I direct them to a few reports to print out to obtain revenue info for the approximately 3 years the customer had used our software. After I spent some time explaining how to read the reports and how to print variations of them with different  date ranges, sorting, etc., I was done. All this took less than an hour and they told us to keep the balance of what they paid as a credit in case they need to call back, which they never did. Easy money.

A couple months go by and one of the owners of this hotel calls and wants to discuss a refund for the software because it cost them tens of thousands of dollars. It turns out she was referring to the taxes and fines she had to pay because she'd been lying to the IRS for years about their income. We politely declined but she insisted saying that she really needs the money now to pay her taxes and it's sort of our fault that she's in this situation now. I feel her pain because the IRS can be a harsh mistress, but our software did its job for 3 years and there won't be any refund coming. I'm still shocked that the IRS went after them because it wasn't that much money for a hotel over at least the 3 years they used our software.",843,0,1,"Your software proved our tax fraud so we want a refund.

Whatever You Just Did Undo It,"It's a bit long, so tl;dr at the bottom

This story comes from about 8 years ago when I was working at my very first IT job at a small shop in the greater Chicagoland area. Despite its size, we somehow managed to do a lot of subcontracting work for very large corporations. I mostly serviced the suburbs, but occasionally had to work downtown, which I loathed due to the traffic, how long it took to get reimbursed for travel expenses, and it typically meant I would be late for my evening college classes. 

This particular call came in at 4:30 p.m. on a Friday and they wanted a technician to show up **now**, which meant that they were paying weekend and emergency response rates for me to show up. The kicker for me was that I was an abused salary employee making $25,000 a year and often working 60 hours a week with travel time, so calls like this really stung. The place was just one street away from the lake type of downtown, and the problem? The manager was unable to record their ""soup of the day"" greeting on their phone system.

I ground through traffic to eventually arrive to a very worked up manager and an Avaya voicemail card for me to install. He explained how and why he needed the card to be configured, and left me to set it up while he darted all about the place. I configured it, and then called my boss to make sure that I had done it correctly (also, if I was working on a Friday afternoon I was dragging him into it). I then hunted down the manager to show him how to work it and closeout.

I'm showing him how it works and it's something like:

Me: ""So it's pretty easy, you will just need to press this button then this button, record the message, then hit this button, and BAM! That's it you are good to go."" I finish by hitting him with a very pleased, I just drove 2 1/2 hours, please, please sign off on this ticket type of customer service smile.

Customer: ""Wait, so you are telling me that I have to record the greeting EVERY single morning when I come into work?!!""

Me with that feeling of dread sinking in: ""Well yes, if you want a different greeting every day with the soup special of the day you would have to record a different message every day.""

Customer: ""That's completely unacceptable! I can't waste precious time every morning doing that!""

Me: ""Oh my... Umm... maybe perhaps you could just record one message that says what the soup special is each day of the week and leave that as the permanent greeting as a solution?""

Customer: ""No, our specials change every week. I tell you what, whatever you just did, undo it.""

I attempt to persuade him to change his mind by again showing him how easy it is to do and give him a little cheat sheet on the process, but to no avail. I was totally shocked when he signed off on the service ticket that outlined the hours and charges, a rather large expense just for the work to immediately be undone. I left the voicemail card with instructions on how to re-insert it to restore its functionality. I took my signed service ticket and dashed out of there before he could change his mind. 

I still chuckle about the urgent ""You need to show up NOW"" that changed to that ""Whatever you just did, undo it,"" and the amount of money that was spent on that.

Customer wastes HUGE amount of $ for a 1 minute fix.,"I am stunned right now! In order to make sure this stays anonymous, I'm going to be as vague as possible while still getting the point across...

I work for a company that manufactures things. We make big complicated things that require trained professionals to service, in addition to simpler things that any literate human with opposable thumbs (or a reasonably good mechanical facsimile) can handle.

So I get a call from one of our very experienced technicians. They've been dispatched to change a setting on one of the simpler devices we make. Literally, that's it. This company paid nearly $2000USD (it cost extra for getting it done right away - this customer wanted this very unimportant setting changed immediately!) for this service that was about as difficult to do as changing the channel on a TV when you've lost the remote and you gotta do it using the hidden buttons - but these buttons weren't even hidden! Service calls are billed at a minimum of 4 hours, plus driving time. This setting takes 1 minute maximum to change - if you're doing it for the first time. Maybe 10 seconds if you're experienced.

Then, it turns out the tech didn't actually know how to do it! Now I know they hardly ever work on these units since they are so simple, but the units all have these handy little things called 'user manuals' (trying to make air quotes here) online, for just any old person to use to look shit up. 

So yeah, I'm just a bit shocked right now at the capricious waste of money being spent by a company whose sole purpose for existing is to manage money for their clients while also being stunned by the fact that little ol' me needed to be called to figure out how to do it.",1663,0,1,"Customer wastes HUGE amount of $ for a 1 minute fix.

"""Pay me for my time with your COVID money!""","I posted here once before, but for a little background, I am the manager of a small college's IT helpdesk, consisting of me and 5 student employees that report to me. I've told my student workers in the past that if they experience any alarming vitriol from their client, to transfer the call to me to handle. They don't get paid nearly enough to sit around and listen to ignorant people calling them names, so I am a very protective mama bear when it comes to the way they are treated.

That being said, I recently hired a new student worker, one who is pretty well versed in IT concepts (at least well enough to handle tier-1 tech support on a college campus). I was out of the office for a minute getting lunch, so he attempted to handle a rather... heated client, a parent whose daughter was attending online class with the school. I returned, and he described the call to me, so I just had to share here... We'll refer to the student worker as **SW** and this client as **AP**, or ""Arrogant Parent"".

&gt;**SW:** Thank you for calling \[college's IT department\], this is SW, how can I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** Hi, yes, my daughter is attending an online class and can't see the board. Can you fix that?  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** I'm sorry, just to clarify - what kind of issue is she experiencing when trying to view the lecture? Is the feed cutting out?  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** No, nothing like that, there's a glare on the board, so she and the other students can't see what's being written on the board.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** Well, it doesn't sound like that would be something we would handle, as it sounds like a lighting issue specific to the professor's setup. Has your daughter asked the professor to make changes to the setup to accommodate students?  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** This is obviously an IT issue, that's why I called the IT helpdesk. You need to send someone over to the classroom to move the camera.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** I understand, ma'am, and I can certainly look into this for you. Can I get the professor's name and the room number of the class?  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** Can't you just look it up?  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** I can't look up anything without knowing who the professor is...  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** I don't know, it's something that starts with S.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** Ma'am, I need to know the full last name of the professor. There are several individuals teaching at \[college\] whose name begins with S, so if I were to look up the information you've provided me, we would be here all day and the issue would not be resolved.  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** *(long, exasperated huff, speaking away from the phone to the daughter)* Can you give me the name of this professor because this guy obviously doesn't know how to look up a name.

My student worker was reasonably getting irritated at this point, but he maintained his composure. Eventually, she gave him the name, which was a *hilariously* complex name that he would have never guessed in a million years! She was, however, unable to provide a room number.

&gt;**SW:** Alright, so what I can do here is send an email to the professor on your daughter's behalf, letting him know that his current streaming setup is causing students issues in being able to view the board. I can let him know that if he's having any issues with the setup, that we can send a technician out to his classroom to assist, as he would be able to provide us with the room number.  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** That isn't good enough. You need to send someone out there right now. I'm sure that it's those ridiculous smart boards that are causing the problem, making it difficult to actually read anything going on. Here, I've got a suggestion for you. Why don't you take that COVID money you've leeched from the government and use it to buy blackboards. Those are reliable.  
&gt;  
&gt;**SW:** I'll make sure someone is aware of your feedback. Unfortunately, as you do not know the building or room number, I'm unable to dispatch a technician to the location. I can certainly send that email out, though, to see if there is anything that can be done. In the meantime, I recommend that your daughter reach out to the professor as well, as this may allow for a more immediate resolution. Is there anything else I can help you with today, ma'am?  
&gt;  
&gt;**AP:** Yeah, listen. Your school oughta be paying *me* some of that COVID money since I'm putting in the work that you aren't! At least that way I know it's going to good use.

Ignorance is bliss.,"Obligatory not actually in IT - just a somewhat competent teenager who gets drafted to fix family tech problems.

For this story, we'll be going about six months back. Me and my sister are deep in the terrifying clutches of Wuhan-flu-induced online ""learning"", desperately trying to keep ahead of the constant stream of mind-numbing busy work. I'm almost done with a history assignment when I get a Discord ping.

    Sister: whnng

            help

I head down the hallway and into her room. Her laptop is jacked in, but sure enough, the battery indicator helpfully tells me that it's not charging. I follow the cord up to the power brick and check its LED - bright green. Power *should* be flowing. I pick up the laptop and try a few tricks, but no dice. It must be a hardware problem.

I pull the plug out of its port and eyeball them. It's a simple one-pin circular design, and nothing seems to be bent or missing on either end. I try aggressively re-seating it a few times to no avail. I'm in the middle of spinning it around when I begin to notice several things.

1. Her laptop is hot. Like, almost painfully hot. And the fan is clearly working overtime.
2. The bottom feels just a bit uneven, like the left side is thicker than the right.
3. The entire bottom-left corner of the keyboard is covered in a mess of Scotch tape.

""What's with the tape?"" I ask.

""The keyboard was coming loose.""

Big red flag. I'm fairly certain that laptop keyboards don't just up and separate under normal circumstances unless you're either extremely violent or extremely cheap. Concerned, I rip off the tape, and *the bottom-left of the keyboard plate and chassis have completely separated.* I can just barely see the corner of the main board inside, and the ports on the side have been partially occluded from shifting behind the chassis bezel. 

""Did it ever occur to you that this might not be normal?"" I said.

""Yeah, but I just taped it up."" Fair enough, it wasn't the most premium piece of hardware ($500 Dell, plastic build, not terrible but not great) and she could have thought something just popped.

I don't think it's that. I fish out the model ID from the number spaghetti on the bottom sticker and look up a teardown. Sure enough, the battery is located towards the bottom left. Just to be sure, I gently pry open the gap with my fingers and shine my phone flashlight inside - and *yep the battery is looking like a whole pillow.*

""Yeahhh... you don't have anything important on here, do you?""

""No, why?""

""Because the reason it wasn't charging was because the battery was about to blow and burn this entire fucking room down.""

""Oh.""

Long story short, the machine was immediately shut down and relocated to an isolated garage shelf next to the fire extinguisher, where I believe it continues to sit to this day, pending a means to dump it without inadvertently igniting a garbage truck. We're lucky it stopped charging when it did - she leaves it to charge on carpeted ground in a fairly messy room. You can extrapolate out the rest.

3. The entire bottom-left corner of the keyboard is covered in a mess of Scotch tape.

""What's with the tape?"" I ask.

""The keyboard was coming loose.""

Big red flag. I'm fairly certain that laptop keyboards don't just up and separate under normal circumstances unless you're either extremely violent or extremely cheap. Concerned, I rip off the tape, and *the bottom-left of the keyboard plate and chassis have completely separated.* I can just barely see the corner of the main board inside, and the ports on the side have been partially occluded from shifting behind the chassis bezel. 

""Did it ever occur to you that this might not be normal?"" I said.

""Yeah, but I just taped it up."" Fair enough, it wasn't the most premium piece of hardware ($500 Dell, plastic build, not terrible but not great) and she could have thought something just popped.

I don't think it's that. I fish out the model ID from the number spaghetti on the bottom sticker and look up a teardown. Sure enough, the battery is located towards the bottom left. Just to be sure, I gently pry open the gap with my fingers and shine my phone flashlight inside - and *yep the battery is looking like a whole pillow.*

""Yeahhh... you don't have anything important on here, do you?""

""No, why?""

""Because the reason it wasn't charging was because the battery was about to blow and burn this entire fucking room down.""

""Oh.""

Long story short, the machine was immediately shut down and relocated to an isolated garage shelf next to the fire extinguisher, where I believe it continues to sit to this day, pending a means to dump it without inadvertently igniting a garbage truck. We're lucky it stopped charging when it did - she leaves it to charge on carpeted ground in a fairly messy room. You can extrapolate out the rest.

Moral of the story? Ignorance is bliss, until you get unlucky and wake up at three A.M. in a lithium fire hellscape."
My dog ate my internet.,"So, one day working internet tech support, I get a call from a gentleman whose internet is out. Somewhat interestingly, he lived on the very outskirts of our service area, a subdivision that was just being built. He was one of our first customers in that area (he may have actually been our first and only in that area at the time, it's been a while for me now.)


So the physical cable pedestal (that green box, usually somewhere around one foot square at the base, three feet high or so, there's about one on every block in a more populated area) was actually located inside his backyard, for some reason, I assume some kind of easement.


Before I even started troubleshooting, he told me he was sure the problem was because his dog damaged the pedestal. The obvious symptoms (lights on the cable modem and my tools) backed up that he wasn't getting a signal, but, I mean, a pedestal is a metal box with very little in the way of exposed parts. But, maybe his dog dug down near it and got a buried cable. Ok, sure, we send a tech out.


Now, I very rarely have direct contact with on-site techs, and those are only when I call them. But, a week or two later, I checked into this to see how it went (standard procedure for me with interesting calls, curiosity not procedure) I found the most copious notes ever made by a tech, he knew everyone was going to dispute this if he didn't do so. I'll quote from memory as best as I can.


*""Pedestal was eaten by dog. Yes, eaten. Half the pedestal is missing, insides and outsides. Remaining pedestal has clear bite marks and chunks clearly bitten off. I cannot find most of the pieces that are missing. Dog is as tall as me and twice my weight. Owner called it a wolfhound. He is very friendly, but do not replace this pedestal in customer's backyard, this dog can and will eat it again.""*


Narrator: They. Did. Not. Listen.


The pedestal was eventually replaced, in the same spot. This happened a second time. Notes this time were more along the lines of ""Dog ate pedestal again. Escalating to (some higher person I don't know). WE WILL NEED TO MOVE THIS PEDESTAL""


No notes after that. I gotta assume that it was unbelievable once but not twice.",1003,0,1,"My dog ate my internet.

Turning one man’s week into another man’s hour and a half.,"Obligatory happened a couple of years ago, not in IT but into computers, and this is bit of a long one.

So, I started a new job, having just left one I’d spent automating as much as I could and moved into a team with some great guys and a really SupportiveManager (SM). My colleagues (mostly) knew their stuff, were all up for automating things and making things easier and were helpful in teaching me stuff I didn’t know.

I say mostly, because I was taking over from someone I will refer to as FashionBoy (FB). FB wasn’t too bad to begin with, a little odd in his own way but just kinda plodded along with the job. He taught me the basics and I got to work. This is when the warnings started to come in, people telling me how awkward he was and to be careful.

He was using basic macros that other people had written in Excel, and I started digging into them a bit and learning how they worked. Digging through the VBA scripts I started trying to clean up a lot of the code, trying to speed it up a little bit more than anything while still doing the new job. When recording macros in Excel there tends to be a lot of scrolling that goes on that can just be deleted – so it was just getting rid of a lot of this really alongside some other inefficiencies I was tidying.

All in all – I probably cut it down to about 2/3s of the time, maybe half (they were really messy).

Now he’d only got about 4 macros or so, but I could see there was a lot more he’d previously been doing himself that could be cut down to a macro. A lot of exporting data from the system – cutting and pasting columns, sorting data, deleting things etc. When I could just run a macro to sort it all, delete anything I didn’t need, copy it, and then all I had to do was paste it into the right place. I started recording some macros of my own and tweaking them afterwards to make them more efficient.

It was at this point FB asked me what I was doing (VBA script clearly not being part of the job description). After a little hesitancy, I figured what the hell – he was using macros anyway, so who cared? I explained what I was doing and then “The Change” began.

Exactly what people had warned me about was revealed. He absolutely flipped, saying I didn’t know what I was doing, that I was messing with company processes and was going to break them, that he’d put these macros together for me (he hadn’t put them together, and certainly not for me) and I was ruining them.

In comes SM to save the day – pulls FB into a meeting room and basically tells him where to get off, didn’t even need to ask my side of the story. FB runs out crying, SM comes over to me and tells me to carry on – with the biggest grin on his face. He knew exactly what he was dealing with.
Super weird day – but FB kinda stayed away from me after that, only talking to me when he really needed to. What a blessing!

After a little while I found I’d be using these macros multiple times throughout the week – but for different tasks. I spoke to IT to switch a couple of reports around so I could use the same macro for multiple different reports, and it ended up saving me tonnes of time. So I’d ask for more work – and ended up taking more of FB’s stuff off him. Again, more things I’d automate with macros.

After this – SM found another job elsewhere, and before he left said “This team is far too big for the work there is, do what you can with it and keep your head down”. Oh and how right he was!

I ended up reporting to his OldBoss (OB) for a bit, then moved to a NewManager (NM) within the team. They just left me to do my thing, and had no complaints – as long as everything was getting done.

I ended up with about 10 macros that would do basically a day’s work in 15 mins. Every. Single. Day. Where FB was taking hours, my week was lasting all of about an hour and a half, split across the week. The frustrating thing was that he had the tools – he was even using them, but still didn’t do more with them.

I’d go to OB and NM but neither had the enthusiasm SM ever had to listen to me when I was trying to get more work from them. “Oh you’ve got enough to do, you’ve taken all of FB’s work after all!” and despite my protests, they wouldn’t give me more work (which was just insane). I asked other people if I could help them, but they got protective of what (seemingly little) work they had and wouldn’t accept help.

Unsurprisingly once the management changed, things started to go downhill. I asked if I could work at home (unofficially so that I could do other stuff) but the answer was a firm no. I was just bored – it was like prison - I’d automated myself out of a job and the management didn’t even care. So, I just started seeing how far I could push it. I’d go for walks for hours, listening to Podcasts, Audiobooks, or Music. I’d book myself meeting rooms and play Minesweeper. I’d set myself small challenges like “Can I go for a day without saying a word to anyone?” (this day included multiple meetings with people and data I had to run through – I still succeeded).

As much as I enjoyed my free time – I needed things to do. So, I used the time to get another job, I wrote up the details of what I did step by step, handed in my notice, distributed it out to the team, and left for something new (and a five figure pay rise).

OB couldn’t understand why I wanted to leave - last I heard, they’d just employed 3 new people to join the team.",1475,0,1,"Turning one man’s week into another man’s hour and a half. Obligatory happened a couple of years ago, not in IT but into computers, and this is bit of a long one.

"Fix those e-mails, ASAP!","So  this happened on a web project we had for a government agency (because I  love working with them). Development had been completed for a good one  and a half year, and we were in a rather uneventful supporting phase,  until an error ticket arrived from the customer:""Notification e-mail not arriving on form submission. Fix it ASAP!""

A  little context: The site we developed was for a government program that  business owners could apply for. This is what 'The Form' was for. Upon  submitting The Form, the application information would be stored in the  system, and a notification email would be sent out to a set of  predefined addresses. Except that the e-mails stopped arriving. Although  these notifications weren't all that important, since the data were  accessible through their admin portal anyway, the customer was  adamant that we resolve this issue as fast as possible, so I got to  work.

I've checked if the  addresses were correctly set. They were. Then tried it out on our test  server with a test address. The e-mail arrived without an issue. I've  ran a few more rounds, trying to find the source of the problem, but to  no avail. I've concluded that the answer might lurk among the mail  server logs, so I handed the ticket over to the server management to  check the mail server logs. Now, the application is hosted on the  customer's server. We have access to it, but are not directly  responsible for its architecture. This'll be important.

A  few days go by, no news about the email problems, I'm pretty much  preoccupied with other projects, kinda forgot about this ticket already.  That is, until the following conversation took place with the project  manager (PM):

PM: Oh, by the way, we know what was wrong with the notification emails on the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ project.

My TV doesnt work,"It's a fairly common occurence, really. I do install work for a local ISP, tv and internet. I also do service calls whenever I finish my to-do list.

I got a call out to a guy who was just Spitting mad. Cussed out the girls on the phone, whole 9 yards. Funky, our older service tech who normally took these calls, was out, so I was helping.

I arrive at their home, and walk in. Guy opens the door, and if looks could kill, I swear I'd be dead.

This is a surprisingly common occurrence, and normally people are a lot cooler and a lot more apologetic.

 There are almost always 3 resolutions to this:

Or, hit. We can remotely shoot a hit to the boxes, and we always ask for our office people to do it when they get a cable call, but never do they. We get out there, we ask them to hit it, it takes the hit, it works.

Why the server room isn't an open access area...,"**I don't think I've posted this one...**


I'm in the server room, working on a new server that's going live sometime later this week. Just doing those little things that help a server work at it's best when it goes live....

Not buying the BS eh? I'm hiding, because I feel like someone beat me with a stick while I slept, and I don't deal well with some people when I hurt this bad. So, I'm hiding in the server room, at my little table, with my KVM bouncing between servers 'looking' for an issue. I've got my headphones on, an audiobook playing so I don't notice someone coming into the server room. 

My first hint that I am not alone is eyeballs between two servers, then I see someone's mouth moving in the form words usually force a mouth to make. I can't hear anything, so I go down to the end of the racks, turn the corner and find myself faced with a Manager.

&gt; Me: *Yelling* HI! You shouldn’t be in here!

&gt; Manager: I...*Yelling* I need you to talk to someone about an issue!

&gt; Me: *mouthing* No No.... (which unless you're a lip reader, apparently looks like you’re saying OK.) *then giving him a get out thumb*

He looks confused, grins, gives me a thumbs up and leaves the server room. I take out my phone, and I see there are no help tickets from this person, no emails directly from this person, and nothing from his manager.

I go back to my little workspace, and I am clearing out temp files on an old server that doesn't know how to tidy up itself. Then I notice one of the servers is off, one that shouldn't be off, I can see the fans sitting stationary. I hit it's KVM number, and it gives me no signal from the source, so I hit the ID button and head around front. I pull the face plate, and turn on the server, then head back around to the back. In the few seconds I take to move back around behind the rack, the server has shut back off. So I do the next thing on the list, unplug the power and push it out so I can pull the top panel to see what's wrong. As I push the server out of the rack, it hits something, I figure it's just the rack door swung partially closed, some of these racks do that.

When I go back around the racks with my trusty step stool, I see Manager laid out on the floor, bleeding from a gash on his forehead.

I drop the step stool and rush over, his eyes are open and he does appear to be breathing. 

&gt; Me: Are you alright?

I get no answer, he just looks at me and then back at the server sticking out of the rack. I stick my head out the door and tell whoever is in earshot to call HR and get the first aid kit.

Suddenly it's a party, everyone is gawking in through the windows to the server room. The HR guy see's the blood and calls 911, for an ambulance and the cops, in his defense there was a lot of blood on the guy's forehead. They are afraid to move him, and there is even some talk about turning off some of the noise. I just look at them like they are insane at that comment as I stand to the side and let the first aid trained HR guy handle the situation.

The EMS guys arrive, declare it's safe to move him and finally everyone is out of my server room. Then the cops arrive and have 100 questions, and I don't enjoy 99 of them. They lessen up the questions after I tell them it was all caught on camera, and they go off to HR to watch the replay. 

I explain that I think what happened was that the Manager came back in and was looking for me. Instead of looking behind the racks he was looking through them, and I just happened to catch him in the forehead with a server I was working on at the time. Then I had to explain how I didn't hit him with the server. He hit the server, it's not like I was watching to see someone get right at the correct spot before I pushed the server out of the rack. At this point, I'm certain most of the company thought I threw a server at the guy, or used it like a club to bludgeon him in the head. The cops come back by and tell me it appears to be a workplace accident, and thank me for my time. That works for me.

I log into the camera system, pull up the camera for the front rack area and scroll back a bit to see what happened. 

I see me come around to the front, open the door, turn on the server and then head back to my workspace. The Manager comes back in the server room, and leaned over looking through the server racks. I apparently had just gone behind the racks when he came in the door, because he looks through all the racks until he gets to the open door. He leans over, I see the server start to slide out, he hears or senses the movement, looks up straight into the server.

I replay that bit a few times, it looks like he did it on purpose, but I've been told it's not safe to leave this guy out in the rain, if you know what I mean. I guess he knows why we don’t let everyone into the server room now.

He looks confused, grins, gives me a thumbs up and leaves the server room. I take out my phone, and I see there are no help tickets from this person, no emails directly from this person, and nothing from his manager.

I go back to my little workspace, and I am clearing out temp files on an old server that doesn't know how to tidy up itself. Then I notice one of the servers is off, one that shouldn't be off, I can see the fans sitting stationary. I hit it's KVM number, and it gives me no signal from the source, so I hit the ID button and head around front. I pull the face plate, and turn on the server, then head back around to the back. In the few seconds I take to move back around behind the rack, the server has shut back off. So I do the next thing on the list, unplug the power and push it out so I can pull the top panel to see what's wrong. As I push the server out of the rack, it hits something, I figure it's just the rack door swung partially closed, some of these racks do that.

When I go back around the racks with my trusty step stool, I see Manager laid out on the floor, bleeding from a gash on his forehead.

I drop the step stool and rush over, his eyes are open and he does appear to be breathing. 

&gt; Me: Are you alright?

I get no answer, he just looks at me and then back at the server sticking out of the rack. I stick my head out the door and tell whoever is in earshot to call HR and get the first aid kit.

Suddenly it's a party, everyone is gawking in through the windows to the server room. The HR guy see's the blood and calls 911, for an ambulance and the cops, in his defense there was a lot of blood on the guy's forehead. They are afraid to move him, and there is even some talk about turning off some of the noise. I just look at them like they are insane at that comment as I stand to the side and let the first aid trained HR guy handle the situation.

The EMS guys arrive, declare it's safe to move him and finally everyone is out of my server room. Then the cops arrive and have 100 questions, and I don't enjoy 99 of them. They lessen up the questions after I tell them it was all caught on camera, and they go off to HR to watch the replay. 

I explain that I think what happened was that the Manager came back in and was looking for me. Instead of looking behind the racks he was looking through them, and I just happened to catch him in the forehead with a server I was working on at the time. Then I had to explain how I didn't hit him with the server. He hit the server, it's not like I was watching to see someone get right at the correct spot before I pushed the server out of the rack. At this point, I'm certain most of the company thought I threw a server at the guy, or used it like a club to bludgeon him in the head. The cops come back by and tell me it appears to be a workplace accident, and thank me for my time. That works for me.

I log into the camera system, pull up the camera for the front rack area and scroll back a bit to see what happened. 

I see me come around to the front, open the door, turn on the server and then head back to my workspace. The Manager comes back in the server room, and leaned over looking through the server racks. I apparently had just gone behind the racks when he came in the door, because he looks through all the racks until he gets to the open door. He leans over, I see the server start to slide out, he hears or senses the movement, looks up straight into the server.

I replay that bit a few times, it looks like he did it on purpose, but I've been told it's not safe to leave this guy out in the rain, if you know what I mean. I guess he knows why we don’t let everyone into the server room now.

That time I gave Texas style brisket dry rub instructions in between instructions on how to test a flickering screen.,"Got a call a week or so ago regarding a flickering screen. 

&gt; $Me - Thanks for calling IT this is Me, how is your day going?  
&gt; $Her - Its fine, and you?  
&gt; $Me - So far terrible, how can I help?  
&gt; $Her - Hah you're funny. I am working from home and I have a screen that is all funky.   
&gt; $Me - Funky like platform shoes complete with goldfish inside of them? Or funky like its acting weird.   
&gt; $Her - *Laughs* Its flickering and flashing strange colors.   

Suddenly I hear her someone else in the background. Its another woman asking what her husband wants prepared for the dry rub on the brisket. There is some back and forth until I hear this. 

&gt; $Her - Well I may have to call him and ruin the surprise. I have no clue how he likes it.   
&gt; $Me - I personally prefer to mix my own dry rub.   
&gt; $Her - Oh? What do you use.   
&gt; $Me - 1/3rd cup of brown sugar, 3 table spoons of paprika, 3 TBL spoons of kosher salt, 2 TBL spoons of garlic powder, 2 TBL spoons of onion powder, 1 TBL spoon of black pepper freshly ground if possible, 1 TBL spoon of dried parsely, 1 Tsp spoon of Cayenne Pepper, 2 TBL spoons of ground cumin, 1 TBL spoon of ground coriander, 1/4th TBL spoon of hot chili powder, 1 TBL spoon of dried oregano. 

&gt; $Me - Mix all of that and rub it into the meat very well before you smoke it. Make sure to really rub it into the meat.   
&gt; $Her - Oh wow thank you.  
&gt; $Me - YOU will also want to unplug the video cable from your non functioning monitor, wait about 10 seconds and plug it back in. Let me know if that fixed the issue.

Since upgrading our network your software is terrible.,"This customer had been having a lot of issues that seemed to be network related so we recommended that they hire someone to check things out for them. A couple weeks of this happen and then calls start rolling in complaining that the software is running worse than ever and it now almost unusable. It's pretty obvious that the problem is related to the network so we recommend they have someone check it out again. The owner calls us pretty angry telling us that he had the network completely redone and that the problem is clearly with our software so we need to fix it. We have an application and network benchmark and when they run it the score is so low that it's just obvious the network is the issue. This place is just a couple hour drive away so the owner offers me a free night at his hotel, free dinner, and drinks, as well as paying our hourly rate, if I'll come look at it for him.

The owner isn't there when I get there and he never shows up either. The general manager is there and she shows me to the server room and I start to see what the problems are. There's no way the owner hired a professional. Their network switch was on top of a stack of boxes with cables tightly stretched and going off in several directions. This switch was under the AC vent in the ceiling and there was a very slow drip that was landing on the box the switch was on and was splashing on to it. The general manager confesses that the owner did this. He ran all new cables that he made from a kit be bought online. I guess he made the cables too short or just had no idea how run cable and this disaster was the result.

The general manager also asked me to look at the guest wifi since it stopped working as well. She shows me the access point and I ask her what the wires connected to the antenna plugs are (they lead to a jumbled mess and I can't see where they go). She tells me that the owner installed some really long antennas to give the wifi better range. Unable to locate anything that looks like an antenna, I ask her where the antennas are. She points to two white wires, each in a corner of this room going from about shoulder level to the ceiling. I take a closer look and these are just a cheap white 2 wire extension cord where the wires were separated. Yes, just a single wire being used for each antenna. 

I explain that I can't really do anything for them and the general manager understands. She isn't a tech person but when I start pointing things out to her she gets it. Obviously water and networking equipment don't mix. And she understands that using an extension cord wire in place of a properly tuned wifi antenna won't work. I eat my dinner and head back home.

I expected to get another angry call from the owner but a couple days later I get a call from an actual IT professional. We have a good laugh about state of things in that server room and within a week he has them running better than they ever had.

Call center woes,"So years ago I worked for a badly run call center.  Most of the people were good but the 'leaders' were horrible.

I was in IT as the developer.  One day we had to have an urgent meeting regarding site security.  I was told that every user was to be given Admin rights in the intranet immediately.

I said no, but out of curiosity what was the reason.  I was told that 'my rules' are too restrictive and that no one could do anything.

I explained to them that security was based on job position, and positions were given specific access to certain functionality within the system.   Could they explain further?

One person needed access to one specific function that their position should have afforded them, but was accidentally left out of the security.  In three seconds I added that piece to their position security and everything was good.

They seriously wanted me to give 300 employees admin access to every function in the system (including payroll and hr) just so one person could have one minor function.

But this made me look bad because I questioned authority by keeping security in the system.

&amp;#x200B;

Another great story was I was told (same job btw) to fix something relating to the credit card for a persons account.  I looked in the database and found that not just the credit card information was being stored, but also the CVV and expiry date as well, in plain text!  I freaked out and went to the 'leaders' and they said 'so what, we might need that one day'.  I said no, and in exactly 10 minutes I was going to remove all of that data and change the website to not even allow the saving of this info.

I was told not to do that under any circumstances.    I said having this information is illegal and must be removed.  Did you want to go to jail over this?  Will you sign an email telling me to leave unencrypted credit card information in the DB? (they wouldn't of course)

And this was the moment that the 'leaders' decided they didn't need an IT department anymore.

I left shortly after that but....

Last one, I promise.  So I have contact with the person who does IT in that company now and when agents started working from home we would set them up with a router and an ip-sec tunnel for security.  However, that costs too much so the guy who does it now has it set up with nothing but pptp.  To top it off they not only have access to customer information in our system, but information through the company they worked for as well.

Why listen to your IT person if you just can do the exact opposite of what he says?,"Not too long ago one of our customers decided that they need to update their age old business software to a new version. Since they have their own ""specialized"" company that advises them when it comes to that software this meant that I had to do some co-op work. 

This story involves the following persons:

*Me* = responsible for managing the IT infrastructure of the customer

*Boss* = the boss of the company that is our customer

*Genius 1* = the dude from the specialized business software company who is responsible for our customer

*Genius 2* = the dude from the specialized business software company who isn't actually responsible for the case but is consulting Genius 1 since they both know that Genius 1 is absolutely clueless (spoiler: what they don't know is that Genius 2 is quite clueless as well)

So a few days before the date that was arranged for the update, Genius 2 calls me, asking me if the customer's server had a CD drive.

I tell him that it hasn't.

He responds ""Well but how can we install the update then? We'll have to update several versions and some of them are only available on CD!""

Me: ""Just copy the content of each CD into a folder on the network share. Or upload it in the web and download it. Or do an ISO of the CDs so that we can mount it. More or less everything would work...""

He: ""Ah, ok, yeah. I'll explain it to Genius 1.""

15 minutes later I receive a mail: ""Here's Genius 2 again. Do you happen to know if the customer might have an external CD drive that we could use?""

My reply: ""I think they have. You could use it from one of their workstations to upload the content of the CD to the network drive if you like. But don't hook it directly to the server. It won't work. That's virtual machines.""

His reply: ""Ok, please make sure that they have an external CD drive and confirm it to me.""

So I call the customer (Boss), let them confirm that they have an external CD drive and tell them that it could be used to copy the contents of the CDs via a workstation to the network drive if  - for whatever reason - Genius 1 or 2 can't provide the data as a download themselves. I also told the customer that he shouldn't hook the CD drive to the server because it won't work.

Two days later the ""Boss"" calls me: ""Hey, I just plugged the external CD drive to the server but it doesn't show up!"" \[he means: it doesn't show up in the virtual server\]

Me: ""Mmmmmh... okay? But why did you do that? Didn't I tell you two days ago not to hook the drive to the server?""

Boss: ""Well, Genius 1 told me to do it.""

So I explained to the boss - again - that it doesn't work and what he should do instead. He agreed to do so this time.

The next day Genius 1 called me to confirm some information that he needs to access the server that I gave him long ago. I used the opportunity to ask him why he tells the boss to do things of which I explained before why they shouldn't be done:

Me: ""Didn't Genius 2 explain to you why hooking up the CD drive to the server won't work and is unnecessary anyway? I told him what you could do instead.""

Genius 1: ""Yeah but you don't understand... those updates for the older versions... they are only available on CD! We can't download them from the vendors website!""

Me: ""I understand this very well, that's why I explained to you guys how you can get that data from the CD to the server!""

Genius 1: ""Yes I understand that the server has no CD drive... that's why we asked if there is an external CD drive available!""

Me: ""... well ... anyway ... the Boss has copied the data from each CD into a folder on the network share for you in the meantime. If you access the server you'll find it at location xy""

Genius 1: ""In a folder? But how can I open the CD from a folder?""

More and more doubting if I'm awake I then did a remote session together with Genius 1 to show him, how he can double click an EXE file inside a folder in order to launch the installer... he finally seemed to understand and I started to ask myself if it's a responsible thing to do if we let guys like him accessing the server.

Epilogue:

A few days later I had to do a short visit on the customers site because of an unrelated project. When I quickly checked on the server I found an external HDD with a sticker ""NEVER PULL THE PLUG!"" lying next to the server. Not plugged in. 

The purpose of this HDD is to receive daily image backups of the server. Now the fact that it has been unplugged isn't dramatic because obviously we also have other backups in place (NAS &amp; Cloud) but I still found it mildly irritating that this HDD lay there unplugged when it even had a sticker on it saying that it shouldn't be unplugged.

So I asked the Boss if he had an explanation for this. Well, you'll guess it:

""Ok, I have a $250,000 home loan with XYZ bank over 25 years. We are 8 years into the loan. If I want to change this to a 30 year mortgage, how much would my monthly repayments be and how much extra total interest would I need to pay for the extra 5 years on the loan?""

He said

""I'd have to calculate that and let you know""

To which I replied

""That's not good enough. You're a mortgage expert, you should know these things"""

One of the workers comes to the closet and says they think they know the issue.

I follow the worker outside where the gentleman states that there was an old phone line running from the building that was draped on the ground going to the phone pole outside (there was a storm last night that probably broke the coiled excess cable and dropped it to the ground).

New guy learns our most basic rule.,"Evening family. Have a tale to tell.  Literally just happened.

Me

New guy: My young cousin

User: Hapless as the day is long. 

I don’t work tech support anymore. Gave up that life. I teach now. New problems, but you never forget those tech support lessons. 

Today my young cousin learned our most basic rule. 

I get a call from him around 7:30 pm. 

New guy: hey goodolbeej, I’ve been working on this for a couple hours. Can you help me fix it?  

Me: “yeah sure. Tell me your problem.” I say with great reluctance on the inside. Phone tech support is the worst. 

New guy: “Oh no, I mean can you come out here?  User can’t get her monitors to work and she promised her boss she’d be able to log in tomorrow.”  

It’s a 45 minute drive to that side of town. Plus fix it time, plus the drive back, on a school night. I’m seething inside. All of a sudden this is my problem?

Me: “No. Not really possible. How about you explain what’s going on, maybe FaceTime?”

New guy: “Understandable”. (God bless him) “she has two monitors hooked up to her laptop. But it routes through this....box”

I’m worried now. Some cracked setup I’ve never put eyes on before. Splitter maybe?  Need to start with the basics. 

Me: “Ok cousin, imma send you a zoom link, so I can see the problem”

Queue a few minutes of logging in, sending a zoom link, hi’s and hello’s. 

Me: “ok, what kind of cable is coming out of the laptop”

New guy: “USB C. Like my phone uses to charge.”

Internally, I’m dying inside. That box has me worried. Taking the sub output via...special software?  We are so boned. 

Me:  “And that goes into the box?”  

New guy: “Yup.  I think it powers it?”

More internal, but now confused, screaming. 

Me: “Ok. Let’s take a look at the box. What is the input labeled as?  And also, potential outputs?  Let’s get an idea of what this is doing”

New guy: “Ok, it’s a dell, made in China...” (bless his heart, being so detailed!!) “here is the back, usb...Ethernet...power?  Power!? Wait what!?!?”

Internal screaming has turned to laughter. 

New guy: “Wait, User, you said this was powered from your computer?  Where is the power cable?!?”

I shit you not, this was her response. 

User:”Oh you mean this??”

New guy, in the purest form of relieved exasperation: “Yes I mean that!!!”

1 min later everything is working. 

Before I end the call I get his attention:

Me: “New guy, that was fun. I know your a little frustrated right now, but today you learned our most important lesson. And User, please don’t take this the wrong way, but new guy... Always verify the basics yourself, NEVER, ever trust the user.”

Mom: my mother, who is not all that tech-savvyMe: The cracker of the code

I am a student ""working"" from home during quarantine. Yesterday she had a friend over for her birthday (she had 1 friend over, the maximum in my country is 2 at the moment). Because I wanted to give them privacy, I vacated the livingroom. When her friend left again, I returned to the livingroom to this.

&gt;Mom: Oh when you where upstairs the dishwasher beeped some error code. So I turned it back on again  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: What was the code?  
&gt;  
&gt;Mom: I don't remember something with water.

I ran to the dishwasher to turn it off.

&gt;Me: Mom you have a phone take a picture of the errorcode and, next time don't turn the dishwasher back on.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mom: But why?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: You said it yourself it was something with water, you could've easily ruined a water pump worth $500

I know $500 dollars is an exaggeration, looking back at it it was probably only $30. Anyway I thought it might have been the drainpump so I cleaned it out, which was necessary because it was full of spaghetti. Besides, it was still in the middle of a program so I it was full of murky water so I couldn't see the pump. (I will not go in to detail how she scolds me for the parts dripping on the floor, but she did.)

So I turned the dishwasher back on and let it finish it's program. When it was trying to drain the water, it made a low grumbling noise and asked my Mom if she heard that earlier but she said she didn't. A few seconds later the machine beeped, and spit out an Error code and a picture of a spigot (so that's how she knew it was water related). The Error code was E24 on a \[manufacturer name\] dishwasher, and If you google that it's the drainpump having trouble. Turns out I missed a piece of plastic that was used as a seal for a plastic bottle of fries sauce (mayonaise like).

&gt;Me: So what are you going to do next time mom?  
&gt;  
&gt;Mom: Google the Error code?

&gt;Me: How are you going to Google it?

While saying this I open the dishwasher back up so she could see the manufacturer.She got the point and now knows what to google. I doubt she'll remember it since it doesn't come up often and she needs repetition.

TL;DR did tech support on a dishwasher after it spit out an error code without solving the error and turning it back on.

"""hey e4, I have an idea!"" ""that won't work e3, hey bossmang, I have an idea!""","this was a decade ago when i was a lowly E3 in the world's greatest air force.

I was a radar tech working on the old tps-75 systems. the original design was from the 40s, latest upgrade was in 1975. The processor cabinet consisted of hundreds of circuit boards and took up most of the space in the radar trailer. 

for a few months, our system was amber, (partially mission capable). The way these systems work is pretty complex, but simply put there are 2 inputs. Raw radar data (primary), which are the returns from the RF that have bounced off of targets and the secondary input which comes from the transponders on each aircraft. 

there are different types of responses from the transponders, but we dealt with modes 1, 2 (military codes) and C (altitude data from the aircraft).

&amp;#x200B;

we had a problem that showed our primary altitude data was consistently between 500-800 feet below what the secondary mode C was showing for each aircraft. The senior techs tore through the processor cabinets, swapping every single card that had anything to do with processing the altitude data fro a new card.

So I do what any junior tech should do when confronted with a hard technical problem: I got out of the way, read the docs and followed orders. Except at the end of each day, we were no closer to resolving the issue. No matter what we did, no matter what we changed, the altitude would always be a few hundred feet low. 

One morning, heading out to do PMIs (periodic maintenance inspections) with an E4, I had a eureka moment of sorts. 

Me: Hey E4, why don't we try replacing &lt;unrelated card&gt;. It's a long shot, but hey, maybe it'll work.

E4: Nah

 We went through the startup sequence for the system, tweaked the I and Q drivers, checked the scopes, all normal. Left it turning and burning and headed back to the shop. Once inside, E4 suddenly has a great idea.

E4: I know! Let's swap &lt;unrelated card&gt;! 

Senior Tech: That probably won't work, E4. But what the hell?

It took quite an effort of will to not allow my jaw to drop to the floor, or to allow my rage to show too much. 

So we went back out with a brand new &lt;unrelated card&gt;. Turned off the system, took out the old and inserted the new and, hey presto, mode C and raw altitude data match. 

I was happy that the radar was back green, pissed that E4 stole my idea and passed it as his own, so i got none of the credit.But in the end it didn't matter. Because another junior tech forgot to open the vents the following week and the processor cabinet overheated and random cards got fried. Radar was red, and never came back to green.

"Also, my granddaughter is single.","We had a customer, a very nice older lady,  who owned cottages on Prince Edward Island. I was working with her on some customizations and setup of the software, so I got to know her pretty well. I eventually ended up being her primary contact when she called.

One afternoon she asks if I'm married and at the time I wasn't and told her so. She then tells me that I should come visit since I've been doing so much work for her. She's starts telling me how she's been considering turning the business over to her granddaughter and that her only concern is that her granddaughter is single and she needs a man to help her with the cottages. Well that's odd information to offer to the tech guy.

She tells me there aren't really any good guys left on PEI and gets straight to the point and asks me if I'd consider moving to a place like PEI if I knew a girl was waiting for me there.

Don't get me wrong, this girl was really pretty and the small cottages they owned were beautiful, but this was starting so sound like a mail order husband type thing.

It starts to creep me out a little and the next time I speak with the grandmother she asks me again. I tell her I'm flattered but not ready to move or get married any time soon. She tells me she's disappointed but understands and that if I change my mind she'll be happy to make arrangements.

I just checked Google and these cottages are either no longer in business or changed the name. I wonder if the granddaughter ever found a man.

"Reliable Backup Systems are for weak mortals, apparently","So some fairly important backups were stuck on a way too old Server in our server room.

Incompetent Security: Another Story,"Recently our parent company demanded we clean up admin rights in our environment. We had about 150 users who had been added to the local admin group on their PC. Some because no one wanted to figure out what in their workflow needed “admin” rights and try and fix it, and others were “temporary” but never removed. Once the demand was made, parent company retreated back to their tower, leaving us alone.

And thus, one day soon after our security team decreed, “no longer will any user be allowed to be added to the local admin group on a PC! Every account that needs admin access must be in a security group. We will configure a GPO to rip out all entries from the local admin group and add what we choose!”

“Will there be any way to give a user admin rights?” People asked. “What about even temporarily?”

“No! No user accounts allowed in the local admin group!” Security said, “If someone needs admin rights temporarily, we’ve created the security group “Temporary Admins” that we can add them to. That group will be added to the local admin group on all PCs.”

“But,” many, many people replied, “that gives a user admin rights to all PCs, not just theirs. That seems worse than just giving them admin rights on their PC.” 

“No worry! Security will approve or deny all requests for admin rights. We will be all knowing and keep the list in check and prevent abuse.”

“And how long will users be allowed to stay in the group?” We asked.

“We expect the users to let us know when they no longer need admin rights.” Security replied. 

If you’ve read any of my recent stories you know our Security team is not the best. So, this process was implemented, and Security received all requests for PC admin rights. And then one of the biggest flaws of our security team revealed itself. They do not question anything. They get asked to do something, they do it. (There were definitely times they granted admin access when stopping to question the ticket would have revealed other ways to get users access to what they need. One is TFTS worthy for sure.)

Time passed. All seemed to be going well. Then last week, the skies darkened. 

“We are following up on our directive!” a voice boomed from our parent company. “How many users are currently in the Temporary Admin group?”

“Uhm, 197.” Security whispered. 

“What?!” The voice boomed again. “How are there that many? That’s more than you started with!”

“We…we were expecting users to let us know when they no longer needed admin rights.” Squeaked Security.

“This…is what you came up with? We need to have a discussion with you…” The voice trailed off.

We now wait to see what the next process will be. Most likely coming from our parent company directly this time.",1546,0,1,"Incompetent Security: Another Story Recently our parent company demanded we clean up admin rights in our environment. We had about 150 users who had been added to the local admin group on their PC. Some because no one wanted to figure out what in their workflow needed “admin” rights and try and fix it, and others were “temporary” but never removed. Once the demand was made, parent company retreated back to their tower, leaving us alone.

And thus, one day soon after our security team decreed, “no longer will any user be allowed to be added to the local admin group on a PC! Every account that needs admin access must be in a security group. We will configure a GPO to rip out all entries from the local admin group and add what we choose!”

3 SINCGARS radios are down and only you can fix them. Make us proud!,"SINCGARS. Is that even a thing anymore?  I did a quick google search and found a manual located at CryptoMuseum.com. WTF a museum? Damn I guess this was a while ago. Anyway . . . 

Thanks Major Boss. Yeah, I was pretty good with electronics and being in the commo platoon of BN HQ, I was chosen to go fix some radios. Apparently this was a big deal and someone was trying to impress someone else it seems because my chauffeur was the company CO. I'm a lowly Pfc being driven around by the Captain. Nice.

I was told that these radios were working the night before and I have very limited equipment with me to troubleshoot since this is just a short field training exercise. Basically a soldering iron, multimeter, hand tools and the fill device that allows me to manually upload a new hopset just in case that got buggered. Not a lot I can do, really, but most of the time the problem is a cable that isn't properly attached. 

So we roll up on whatever company this is, I forget but let's call them Echo because I was in 3 different Echo companies and I like the sound of it. We meet up with Echo's CO and he takes us to this swagged out GP medium tent, with all the accoutrements of home. These guys had Christmas lights, a TV/VCR combo watching Tombstone, rugs and lots of beer cans. And there on a well lit table, to my dismay and horror, lay the shells of 3 SINCGARS radios and what likely is the internal components of each. My CO  grins and says, ""It looks like we have everything we need, let's get to it.""

I ask the Echo CO what happened between last night when they were working and now and he tells me he's not sure, they just found them on the table. That sounds plausible of course. My theory quickly develops into believing that one or more of the occupants of that tent, probably the ones who emptied those beer cans, had a fun evening of disassembling these radios. I've never seen the inside of one of these things I don't know what I'm supposed to do, especially considering nobody will tell me what happened.

I explain that I have no schematics and I've never seen the inside of the radio and the Echo CO steps away then brings me what he says is a working radio with the top cover already removed. Is he running a black market radio business? So I get to studying the ""working"" radio for a while and then make piles of components for each radio. After several hours and several attempts I'm able to get things put back together and a 2 of the radios work. I'm also able to determine that the 3rd radio likely has a bad power supply.

That's when the Echo CO says, ""Yeah, that's what I though it was."" Then he decides to be honest with me. He and a couple other drunk soldiers decided they would troubleshoot the bad radio by swapping components with another radio until they forgot what goes where in their drunken state. Then they opened a 3rd radio and rather than use it as a reference to put the parts back in the first 2, they start cannibalizing it too. Drunk logic I guess. Aaannnnnnd then they open a 4th radio, but before they butcher this one someone suggests they wait until morning. By morning they were sober and that's when they called for help. The only reason this became a fuss is because the Echo CO caused this mess and he had 3 dead radios in parts to try and explain. I guess he called an begged the right person. Honestly any sober person should have figured it out by looking at a good radio because most components are just modules you can replace and not bundles of wires.

What did I get out of all this? The thanks of the Echo CO and my own CO. We also took the long way back, which included a stop along a highway at a gas station / diner for some of the best chicken  livers I've ever had. All I could eat and I was starving. I filled my plate more than once and probably went through a half bottle of hot sauce.

"With great Admin access comes great responsib- no, that's not right, it's Tech Support's fault.","So there's a few bits of context to get out of the way.

Our customer resource management system has two user account access levels (given different names for safety):

* Admin - The administrative access level that our customers have access to. Lets you manage employees, see all their contacts, manage the website, ect. When an employer purchases the system, their user account is automatically an Admin. They have access to give Admin access to other employee user accounts if they wish.
* Grunt - The regular, bare bones user access for employees. You get what you need to do your job and nothing else. They typically manage their own customers/contacts, but Admins can manage them too if needed.

Admin users can send emails and texts in bulk to multiple customers in their account's database. Grunts can only send emails and texts in bulk to their *own* customers. Keep this in mind.

**TiltedCompany:** one of one of our largest clients, hundreds of employees on one account with something around 15 Admins.

**WrathfulOwner:** The owner of TiltedCompany.

So a few weeks ago, one dismal Tuesday morning, our first call of the day is from one of the Grunt users on TiltedTeam. They report, panicked, that they'd logged in to find that the system had sent a totally random out of context email to *all* of their customer contacts. At 3am.

I will note here that even though there's automated email and text features our users can set up to communicate with their customers, everything has a failsafe to prevent shit from getting sent outside of business hours. If those failsafes were for some reason fucking up, we were about to get a fucking shit load of calls. However, there is nothing to stop our users from MANUALLY sending emails or texts after hours.

As we're investigating this, we get a call from another Grunt user on TiltedCompany. Same thing happened to them.

As you can probably guess, everything snowballed from there and our ticket/phone queue lit up like some demented Christmas tree as more Grunt users from that company woke up to see all the confused replies from their customers. It is not even 9:30, half of us are barely into our first cup of coffee, and we've got enraged half-awake Grunt users losing their minds over this.

Some have to be bear-wrestled off the phones because at this point no one has a fucking clue what happened and no one's had time to check. Some have started email chains with our tech support email address CC'ed, causing a clusterfuck in the ticket queue.

Eventually, WrathfulOwner calls in and gets a coworker. Temper's high, boss status is up, and titties are *out*. Dude wants a manager right here, right now, and if he doesn't get one in the next 12 nano-seconds, he's sending a nastygram to our CEO. (He actually said he was in the process of writing an email to our CEO.) This mans is throwing his weight around so hard we can hear the walls crumbling.

Managers run a database query to find a list of all the user IDS for TiltedCompany that were logged in around the time those emails were sent. After getting our engineers to look through the system for any process history that a query couldn't find, they came to a few conclusions:

1. An Admin user had sent something around 70,000 emails in bulk to just about every customer under that account.
2. We didn't do it. The process was not automated and was user-initiated.
3. There are too many cooks in TiltedCompany's kitchen. Some of the Grunts do not even know who all of the Admin users are.

This information was politely relayed to WrathfulOwner in a long email from one of the managers tasked with taming the bull. He, of course, does not believe us, and demands to know why we would ""blame his employees instead of owning up to our system's error.""

In the end, it took another email and three phone calls (one of them with WrathfulOwner's director of ops on the line) to convince him that this was 100% on them and they were just in a huge amount of denial over the fact that they'd given Admin access to someone who clearly could not be trusted with that power.

The frustration/rage was understandable, really. Nobody wants to believe such a huge mistake could be human error, and it *had* resulted in some angry customers.

Crisis was averted, Grunt users were told to refer to WrathfulOwner for any and all questions regarding the matter, and we cleaned up the queue. I had to pull up their account for something unrelated about a week after this nonsense, and saw that the amount of Admins on the account had mysteriously decreased from 15 to 5. The person who'd actually done the deed, well....I didn't see her user account anymore.

Standards?,"This happened when I was working for a Large Heartless Telecom Company who was rolling out a brand new wireless network.

How New? Back then RJ 45 was not so much a ""Standard"" as a ""Suggestion"".

Cue the nightmare. 

We were installing a Cell repeater at an antenna farm at the top of a very high peak. 

I drive up there but at about 500 feet to the top of the peak I come up to a gate. The other ""Competing Heartless Telecom Company"" had blocked access because ""LHTC"" had done so at another site.

Try another. 

Same deal. No signal, no blinky lights. This is a nightmare. I don't want to lug my kit 500 feet in elevation back to my truck and drive 500 miles back to the shop to get the right connectors.

I go back down the mountain to my truck. I find ONE connector from a different vendor. I grab it. Huff BACK up the mountain. (500 feet? You think it's easy? You try walking up 500 feet in elevation 3 times at 10,000 feet in 80 degree weather!).

New Girl needs help with IPNENE,"My office has a dirty WiFi network that we use to troubleshoot VPN connections. At the morning meeting, someone mentions that it's down, so boss tells New Girl \[NG\] to fix it, and we all go back to work.

We talk it over a little more and I suggest swapping out the router with a different one from the warehouse. Boom, network’s back up. All’s good.

But I hate not knowing Techronyms. That’s a good portion of my job. And I’m pretty well-paid, and we work for a big company, and I should be able to figure this out, and it’s really bothering me, like I’m getting really resentful and stressed.

$me: facepalm. 

If you lower your own access maybe it's a good idea to have another admin aware quickly to change you back when you're done testing?"

What to do when there is an broken pair on a 100 ft POE cable that's run underground.,"So a few days ago I got what I thought was an easy assignment. One camera was down on the gas pump canopy at a local gas station. 

Figured no big deal, these things are exposed to the weather and go down all the time. It is New England after all.

Drive over, have the camera swapped out in less than 5 minutes. Go over to the computer and go to assign an IP to it and have it start streaming to the DVR. One problem, the camera is not showing up.

Go over to the POE switch and see that port 4 is dead. Uh-oh those switches are not cheap, but the owners are. Especially when you have to buy them from Microcenter. But to double check I swap port 3 and 4. Port 4 lights up and port 3 is now dark. 

I actually breathed a sigh of relief. Figured that the connectors are bad. Grabbed a meter and sure enough, pins 1+2 had an open line fault. Cut the connectors off both ends, redo them, and buzz the cable again. What do I see? Open line on pins 1+2.

After offering a quick curse in 3 languages. And thinking about how much I hate terminating crimp rj-45 connectors. Redo them again, testing between terminations. Still OL on the first pair. 

Well.... Fuck. No way I screwed it up again. Checked the connector and sure enough the conductors are all the way up against the end of the connector. 

So it looks like there is a break in the orange pair. Problem is the wire goes through a half full conduit, underground.  No way I am pulling that by myself, and that camera has to be up...

So I call the boss man to tell him I need help. But he has an Hail Mary idea. We do need two pairs for data, but maybe we can send enough power over two conductors to power the camera. The distance according to the meter is only about 100ft. 

Plus the camera takes the poe voltage regulates it down to 5 volt anyway. 

So I decide to replace the orange pair with brown, use the broken connectors as separators at the connector, and run power over just the blue pair. 

When I plug it in, I see the camera power up! Holy hell it worked! Ran over to computer and I see it and can assign an IP! Set up the DVR and cast it to the clerk screen and called it a day. 

TLDR: Turns out a POE device can run on the power only two connectors can provide.",361,0,1,"What to do when there is an broken pair on a 100 ft POE cable that's run underground.

You don't even know your own product!,"First off, sorry for the extra long post.

I posted this in r/idoworkherelady but was requested to repost it here. I've also took other's advice and spaced each conversation point for an easier read.

Lets set the WayBack machine for the late 1990's, so I will be paraphrasing MOST of what was said.

I work at a small shop designing and building professional quality video hardware for TV and movie studios. I mean small. At the time there were 3 employees and the boss. In such a small environment, it is expected that everyone has a wide variety of duties and responsibilities, but each of us has a primary speciality. Anyone who has worked in a ""Mom&amp;Pop"" knows what I'm talking about. My duties ranged from inventory control to shipping/receiving to sales and technical support. Primarily, my speciality was technical support. One of our products places a ""bug"" in the video stream used for station identification. If you've ever watched TV, look in one of the corners of the screen during a broadcast and you'll see the station's call letters pop up. Yes, I know, don't hate me for putting up those annoying logos. In the USA, the FCC (Federal Communications Commision) requires it. These aren't the easiest things to setup up. Its a very specific series of steps that MUST be performed if you want any chance of getting the product to work. So, one day I get a call from a radio station in western Colorado needing tech support. What a radio station needs a bug for, I don't know, not my place to question, just get it working for them.

Ok, the cast: Boss: B, RE: Radio Engineer, Me: Obviously, ME.

I get the call from RE.

Me; ""Thank you for calling \*Our Company\*, this is \*Me\*, how can I help you?""

RE; ""I've been fucking with your bug generator for 2 days and can't get it to work. I have to get this working right NOW!""

I can tell this guy is frustrated, I would be too if I'd been trying to get something working and it just doesn't seem to want to.

Me; ""Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Lets see what I can do to get this up and running for you. Can you describe what your issue is?""

With a little more fire in his voice,

RE; ""I just told you, I can't get your fucking product to work!""

Me; ""Ok well, lets start from the beginning. What OS is your computer running and did you install Software Version XX.XX from the included floppy disc?"" (Yes, at the time we were still sending out the software on 3.5"" floppies.)

RE; Of course I did, but your product won't communicate (with the PC).""

Me; ""Can you confirm that the included interface cables are connected to your PC's serial COM port and the other end is connected to ""HOST"" on the product?'

RE; ""Yes, I've already done that. I'm the engineer here, don't you think I would have already tried that?!""

I'm thinking well, I have to start at the most logical place where comms would be interrupted, but ok, this guy is smart and knows his shit.

Me; ""Ok, lets go into the software and make sure its talking on the correct COM port.""

RE; ""I've already done that!""

Me; ""Well, just so we're on the same page I'd like you please confirm what COM port the software has selected.""

RE; ""How do I do that?""

Wait, what? Didn't this guy JUST tell me he already did this, he SHOULD know where to click in the software to see what COM port is selected.

Me; ""Please open the software and across the Menu Bar click on COM PORT and tell me what port number is checked.""

RE; ""3"".

Me: ""Ok, lets tell the software to wake up the product. Click on COM PORT and now click on ....""

With even more fire he cuts me off.

RE; ""I already did that!""

Me; ""Yes sir, you did click on COM PORT to confirm the port we want to ""talk"" on, but now I need you to wake up the unit. So, click on COM PORT and move the mouse down to Wake All Units and tell me if the front panel's LED blinks. This will tell you if communication has been established and we can upload your logo."" 

RE; ""Yeah, now what?""

Me; ""Did the LED blink?""

RE; ""What LED? There's no LED's lit up on this!""

Me; ""Um, ok, is the product plugged in to the power adapter and is the power switch flipped up (on)?""

Even angrier than before,

RE; ""Of course it's plugged in!""

I can hear him flip the power switch.

Me; ""Ok, is the green POWER LED on or off?""

RE; ""Its on, again I told you I've already done all of this!""

Obviously not...

Me; 'Ok, click on COM PORT and scroll down to Wake All Units.""

RE; ""Didn't you just hear me? I SAID I ALREADY DID THAT!""

Me; ""Sir, I am just trying to help and the only way I can do this is by going through each step.""

RE; ""FINE! What do I have to do now?""

Me; ""After you clicked on Wake All Units, did the LED blink?""

RE; ""I don't know, I wasn't looking at it.""

Not going to hurt the product to wake it up again,

Me: ""Lets make sure the PC and product are actually speaking with each other, please click COM PORT and Wake All Units. Tell me if the LED blinked after you clicked Wake All Units.""

Less angry, but I can tell he is still frustrated,

RE; ""Yes, the LED blinked 3 times.""

Whew! The unit seemed to be working and I don't have to give him the wonderful news of having to return it for repair.

Me; ""Great! Lets get your bug uploaded.""

RE; ""Yeah, this is where I have been having trouble.""

I'd say it started before he showed up to work a couple days ago.

Me; ""Ok click on File and Open Bug. Now I don't know where you've saved your image file, so you'll need to locate it, click on it and then click Open.""

his anger is rising again

RE; ""I don't know where it is, just help me load SOMETHING into it and I'll put my real bug in later.""

Not an unreasonable request, that's why I created and included some sample ""bugs"".

Me; ""Ok, click on File and Open Bug. Now scroll to the folder (company name) and open it. You will see several....""

Fire has become inferno

RE; ""Are you not listening? I told you I don't know where our image file is!""

Yea, they heard you in the next county,

Me; ""I understand that sir, I'm going to have you open one of the sample bugs included on your installation disc. These images are to give you or your graphic designer a sample of what this product is expecting when you upload an image.""

RE; ""FINE FINE FINE, just lets hurry up.""

DUH! I don't really want to be on the phone with this numbskull any more either, but I'm pretty much the ONLY person on the planet that can help him. This is not a boast, even the boss doesn't know how to get these products working properly.

Me: ""Ok, click on File and Open Bug, scroll to the folder called (company name) and double click it. You can select any of the images you see here and click on Open.""

He grumbles,

RE; ""I can't believe this is taking so long!""

Me; ""Do you see Sample Bug in the software?""

RE; ""I don't see it on the TV screen!""

Me; ""Yes sir, we haven't uploaded it to the product yet, we've only loaded it into the software. Do you see Sample Bug in the software?""

RE; ""Yes! For Pete's sake!""

Me; ""Great, now we are going to upload the bug into the products memory.""

RE; ""Its about fucking time!!""

why didn't I just stay in bed?

Me; ""Ok, click on File and Upload Bug.""

This should take about 30 seconds, 30 blessed seconds of quiet.

RE; ""Nothing is happening, I don't see anything on the TV!""

Ok, I did assume he had the unit hooked up to a source of video and then to a TV monitor. My mistake.

Me; ""Oh geez, I'm sorry. Do you have a source of video going to the INPUT of the product and the OUTPUT to a TV monitor?""

RE; ""No, I didn't know it needed video to work!""

Me; ""Yes sir, this product will put a bug on top of your video, it doesn't have an internal video generator, so you will have to provide a source of video.""

Unfortunately, it is a common misconception, but everyone pretty much just accepts it and finds something to put out video (ie. VCR (it's the '90s), DVD, or a video test pattern generator).

RE; ""Hang on, let me find something.""

Thankfully I get a couple minutes to hang the phone over my shoulder, sip a soda and rub my cauliflower ear, while he finds some kind of video source.

RE; ""You still there?""

Me; ""Yes sir, are we ready to proceed?""

RE; ""Yeah what now?""

Me; ""Do you see your bug on the TV monitor?""

RE; ""No, I had to turn the product off to plug in video.""

No, he really didn't, but a good tech probably would have, so I'll give him that one. However...

Me; ""Ok, uh, did you save the bug to the product before turning off power?""

RE; ""What do you mean?""

Me; ""After you upload the bug, you will then need to tell the software to save the bug into non-volatile RAM. Otherwise when you lose power, the bug is lost and will need to be re-uploaded.""

At this point, I could probably have just opened a window to hear him screaming

RE;""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?""

Me; ""I'm sorry sir, but no I'm not kidding you. Would you mind clicking on COM PORT and Wake All Units?""

RE; ""FUCK THIS! YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR OWN PRODUCT!! I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR MANAGER RIGHT FUCKING NOW!""

Me; ""Yes sir! Please hold the line"".

I put him on hold and walk to the back office where the boss is and am followed by my other 2 co-workers.

Me;""B, I got a guy on the line that wants to speak with you. He says I don't know our products and is....""

B: ""I heard, people on MIR heard""

(MIR was the soviet space station before ISS).

Me; ""He's on line 2, I'm sorry boss, I really tried.""

Boss gestures for us to sit while he answers the call. He hits the speakerphone to answer.

B: ""This is B.""

RE;"" Yea this is RE. I've been trying to get this product working for a week and the idiot I was talking to doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground. You're going to help me and then educate him on how to properly handle your customers!""

B; ""Sir, the person you were speaking with knows more about that product than the person who designed it. I heard what was going on...""

...I swear this is what B said...

""...You are too stupid to own our product. Return it and we will refund you your purchase.""

And then boss just hung up. He looked at me and said

B; ""And that's how you deal with that.""

After the three of us picked our jaws off the floor..

Me; ""Can I buy us some drinks?""

We never did get the product back, nor did we hear from that radio station again. I wonder if it became RE's new door stop.

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could tell why it is really 'broken.',"In my previous position, I worked as support for credit unions using my company's software. One day, I got a call from a guy who said a feature wasn't working. So I remote in and have him show me how he's reproducing it. The feature is supposed to add a file when double-clicked. It's working kinda spotty for him, so I try it and it works. Hmm... I have him try it again. Again, sporadically working. 

Then I realize I can here him clicking his mouse. One click, like two seconds, then another click. I ask him to try it again as fast as he can. Sure enough it works. Problem solved, right? No. He calls back an hour later saying it's not working again. So, brilliant me, I go to his mouse settings in Windows and just increase the amount of time he has to double-click. It works, I tell him to have a good day and call me back with any problems.

An hour later, he calls back to tell me it's been working and he's wondering what I did to fix it because he has the same problem at his home workstation. I explained it to him, showed him how he could do it. Suddenly, it stops working. I can hear him taking forever for the second click. I again tell him he needs to click faster - it was seriously set at nearly maximum delay. Nope. 

In the end, I had no choice but to escalate to my boss because he wasn't accepting my answer. I detailed what occurred in my ticket and sent it along. The contents of the ticket were something like this:

* Me: Customer had problem with feature X not adding on double-click; He was clicking too slow; Adjusted his Windows mouse settings for longer delay; Worked until I explained what was happening, then stopped working;
* Boss: Fucking really?
* Me: Yup
* Boss: ... God damn it.",519,0,1,"I wish I could tell why it is really 'broken.' In my previous position, I worked as support for credit unions using my company's software. One day, I got a call from a guy who said a feature wasn't working. So I remote in and have him show me how he's reproducing it. The feature is supposed to add a file when double-clicked. It's working kinda spotty for him, so I try it and it works. Hmm... I have him try it again. Again, sporadically working. 

Then I realize I can here him clicking his mouse. One click, like two seconds, then another click. I ask him to try it again as fast as he can. Sure enough it works. Problem solved, right? No. He calls back an hour later saying it's not working again. So, brilliant me, I go to his mouse settings in Windows and just increase the amount of time he has to double-click. It works, I tell him to have a good day and call me back with any problems.

An hour later, he calls back to tell me it's been working and he's wondering what I did to fix it because he has the same problem at his home workstation. I explained it to him, showed him how he could do it. Suddenly, it stops working. I can hear him taking forever for the second click. I again tell him he needs to click faster - it was seriously set at nearly maximum delay. Nope.

My bartenders are stealing cash. Prevent it so I don't have to fire them.,"We see this a lot and I'm not sure what the owners and management are thinking. Maybe employees are hard to find or maybe they like the employee even though they're a thief. This particular customer had video evidence of several of his bartenders pocketing cash. The customer gives them money, the cash drawer opens, they stick the cash in their pocket and then take change from the drawer to give to the customer. Why you wouldn't fire them and call the police is a mystery to me.

But this customer was reasonably successful and had the means to pay for what he wanted. He already had a pretty sophisticated security camera system and wanted our software to interface with this camera system. To accomplish this he needed to get us in contact with the developers of the camera system software and explain to both of us exactly what his plan was. 

And this was his plan. 

* When a sale is made, send a copy of the receipt to the camera system so it can display it on screen, with a time stamp, making an easy reference for the person reviewing the video. This isn't embedded into the video, rather it's handled more like subtitles. This gives you an easily searchable reference for any time cash changes hands.
* Display a series of codes on the screen that the camera must detect and acknowledge before the POS software can proceed. The goal here was to make sure that every step of the transaction was clearly seen by the cameras. The following are when the codes will be displayed.  
1. Pressing the button to begin closing the check.  
2. Selecting the payment type.  
3. Accepting the payment.  
4. Giving change if any is due.

The purpose of the second part was to make sure that any time the bartenders handled money it was clearly seen. This would require an unobstructed view of the screen which would also make the cash drawer easily viewable to the camera. It's extreme but I suppose in a perfect world it might work. Also, in even a less than perfect world you can just fire your crooked bartenders that you already have on video pocketing cash rather than putting it in the drawer.

We ended up doing the first part of his plan but neither we nor the camera software developer were willing to entertain the guaranteed support nightmare of his second part. That's just so many points of potential failure that will bring the system to a halt. Neither of us wanted to put ourselves in a place where we'd have to support the inevitable failures. I hope he eventually chose to fire his bartenders.",2195,0,1,"My bartenders are stealing cash. Prevent it so I don't have to fire them.

Two quick Friday stories,"**""Inability to take action within Gmail""**

Yes, that was the ticket name, the body consisted of:

*""I suddenly cannot reply to emails anymore and the ability to forward them is also gone as well""*

I remote into their computer while calling the user:

&gt;$User: thanks for getting to me so quickly, anyway I can't reply to any emails as the ticket said so you can take a look there if you want. 

I get into their main screen with their email open in front of me. I notice the reply button is missing and there is no drop down menu. I look at the subject and it says *""Hangout Chat message""* (sigh)

&gt;$Me: ""This is a chat message, for some reason Gmail likes to also put your hangouts along with your emails when you search them, yes it looks like an email, but its not. If you'd like to forward this info you can simply copy+paste it into an email. 

&gt;$User: ""But.....okay let me look, okay...so it is a chat message...but why does it show up here?? also let me go to a different email""

I can tell the user doesn't want to make it seem like this wasn't an obvious mistake. She opens another email and *tada* there is the reply and forward button. 

&gt;$Me: ""Let me know if you have any other problems down the line"" 

I close the ticket

---

**""My internet doesn't work anymore""**

Ah yes, the ticket with only a subject line but doesn't have a body to the email, no details expanding on ""internet doesn't work"". I try calling but no answer, I reply to the ticket asking for more detail but then I think well if they don't have internet how can they respond? I ping the users computer and sure enough ""hostname could not be found"". So I put my mask on and walk over to $User's office. As soon as I get there I see the user sitting at their desk, typing on the computer and fumbling with the mouse clearly frustrated. 

&gt;$User: I've been trying forever to get this thing to connect but it wont work. It's frustrating, I even had to go borrow *coworker's* computer so I could even send in that ticket

&gt;$Me: Okay, let me take a look

The first thing I notice is the massive red X on the network icon in the system tray. I kneel down and look at the back of the tower where the network cable comes into the computer and notice the ethernet connector plugged in but no wire, I look over and see the cable with the wire exposed, clearly ripped out from the end.  

&gt;$Me: well this is your problem right here, the cable was somehow ripped right out of the computer

&gt;$User: What? How could that have happened? Could that have happened when I moved my desk?

&gt;$Me: *pauses for a second* When did you move the desk and where did you move it from? 

&gt;$User: It was just right there *pointing about 3 feet away* I moved it over **here** because I didn't want to sit so close to the wall 

&gt;$Me: Well yes, if we need to move a computer, the cables have to be unplugged first. 

&gt;$User: I thought my computer was on wireless

At this point I'm just very confused

&gt;$Me: No, the computer needs a wired connection, it does not have wireless capability, did you notice any other wires while you were moving the tower?

&gt;$User: Well no, I just moved my desk, like I said I thought this was all wireless

This user just dragged her desk away from the wall, why? No idea

&gt;$Me: (trying hard not to sound judgemental) When you moved the desk, you didn't notice any wires at all?

&gt;$User: No, well I figured it would shut off if the power unplugged. 

I go to edit the ticket and CC my boss:

*User moved desk, did not check wires, the network cable was ripped out of the back of the tower, while replacing that cable I had an epiphany regarding their phone connection as well since I was not able to reach them, sure enough the phone cable was also ripped out. I replaced both cables and instructed user to check the cables next time they decide to move their desk around.*

A sad story,"I want to share a little story from yesterday that that made me a little sad.

I work in-house tech support for a highly competitive and commission based industry. Staff are performance managed within an inch of their lives, and terrified to display any weakness, mistake or lack of knowledge to their colleagues. 
This has led to a culture of over reliance on IT, as colleagues are afraid to ask each other, and when they do they're told ""Just call IT""

So on to the story. Yesterday a lady called. She'd waited an hour as we had a couple of major incidents to deal with. She was new and didn't know how to open Outlook. No errors or problems, just didn't know how to open the start menu and find the link. 
Her colleagues, instead of taking 5 seconds out of their day to help, had told her to call IT. 

Not much more to the story, I helped her open Outlook, and spent some time making sure she knew how a few other commons apps work. 

It just left me with a really sour taste in my mouth, that people would treat their colleagues like that",274,0,1,"A sad story I want to share a little story from yesterday that that made me a little sad.

Something must be in the air...,"Seriously. Or they're drinking too much of the Kool-Aid. The past couple of days, our users have been even more...*special* than normal. I'm blaming the election nonsense. A few of the highlights:

**User Submitted ticket** \- summary of issue - Can't Print.....That was it. That was the whole ticket. And of course they don't answer when I call, because why would they? *Heavy sigh and rubbing of temples.*

**User calls in** \- Can't sign in to computer. He just changed his password, and now can't sign in. He's remote on a laptop, not on network. ""Just use the old password, that will work until you take the laptop into the office again."" Nope, not working either. Nothing is getting him in. Finally, I'm about to give up and just tell him to bring it in to the office, and he lays this on me: ""Oh, I've been able to sign in to the desktop the whole time, its Outlook I can't get in to!"" *Head, meet desk*.

**User calls in** \- Trying to install something on iPhone. Its asking for an Apple ID password, and he asks me what the password is because he doesn't know it. I give him the company default password, and he says ""Its my own iPhone, not the company's."" *Hello desk my old friend*.

Sandy Laptop,"I work IT in a government agency and we have a lot of users that are remote and use state issued laptops. Get a call from one of the remote employees telling me his laptop wont turn on. I asked him if anything happened to it and all he said was, ""it was working yesterday, I shut it down, and the next morning its just dead and wont turn on"". 

So I verified all the usual that I could do over the phone. Made sure power adaptor was plugged in (including the brick), tried different wall ports. It was indeed dead. No lights, no fans, no error code lights. Perhaps a bad power adaptor? Unfortunately no spare for him to try.

Wanted to do a power flush, but its one of those smaller 2-in-1 laptops where the battery is inside the case so you have to unscrew the back cover completely off to detach the battery. I had him try power flushing anyway without the adaptor plugged in but still nothing.

I have him bring it in so I can get my hands on it, and maybe do a proper power flush or try a different adaptor. I go to remove the case, and the moment I pop it off, water gets flung everywhere. That part explains it being dead but that's not really the ridiculous part. That comes last.

He notices and immediately is like, ""oh yeah I may have gotten some water on it, but I swear it was working fine even after for the whole day!!'. I tell him that it might be possible for a device to maybe work with a water spill depending on what it touches but it will eventually damage the important stuff and kill it if something is not done immediately. 

There was actually a lot of water inside. It was basically an easy decision that it was not salvageable. I could see little bits of rice from where he tried to syphon the water by sticking it in rice but it was just so much that even the rice couldn't absorb it. The odd thing is that the water was very granule, like it was dropped in the sea, or left on the beach when the tide came in. I noticed some of it caked around the usb ports and in other parts of the laptop. Was an odd mystery. I wanted to probe more but it didn't matter at that point. He ended up getting a completely new machine. Its unfortunate because the one he had was almost brand new.

The ridiculous part about this whole thing is that I got a more complete story about what happened a few weeks later from his supervisor. It wasn't dropped in salt water or left out on a beach somewhere during high tide. It turns out he tried stuffing the laptop in a big bag of sand after trying the rice trick and failing. That's right! He SMOTHERED it in pure granules of sand in a sad but comical attempt to save his dying machine before giving up and calling IT.

you actually need to dial using your phone!,"  

So, this one happened about 15 years ago, when I started at my old job and to this day it’s probably the most hilarious thing that happened to me in my time in tech support.

Half of the users were engineers, as was this one.

$me : me, duh

$user: well, the user, duh

$user showed up in our tech support office, claiming his phone is not working.

I told him to show me, and we went up to his office next to the phone.

I rung it up with my mobile phone and it worked fine.

I then used the phone to ring up my mobile phone, which also worked fine.

$user: “strange, when I call it doesn’t do anything”

$me: “ok, could you do a call then to show me please?”

$user went on, took the phone receiver and put it next to his ear. The he proceeded in dialing the number of my mobile phone. Sounds right? Well it would have, only that he dialed on the num pad of his keyboard!

Remind you that was 15 years ago, dialing software was practically unheard of and we had nothing of the sort, the guy also had been working at that office for 20 years so no, it could not have been for being used to used dialing software.

I explained to him that he actually needs to use the keys on his phone to dial and he facepalmed himself after realizing his mistake.",416,0,1,"you actually need to dial using your phone!

"Our Point Of Sale tablets are missing, you owe us a refund.","In the early 2000s we had a customer who wanted to be cutting edge and use wireless tablets. These were expensive and quite revolutionary at the time. This is also back when we were willing to risk selling hardware so we sold them 10 of these things. I can't remember the brand now but they were blue and silver and ran Windows 2000. Battery life sucked, too, but he didn't care because it was just so cutting edge. 

Because of the battery life issue, he purchased more than he needed so he could have them in charging stations in many convenient locations around the restaurant. I'll admit, the concept was really cool at the time and these tablets really looked futuristic and that's what he was going for. But do you know who else thought the tablets were cool and futuristic? The customers and the employees. After just a few months we get a call that half of the tablets have been stolen and that we owe him a refund for selling him tablets that can be so easily stolen. 

The sales person is trying to help him understand that stolen property isn't our responsibility but he'll hear none of it. When asked what we should have done to prevent it he tells the sales person that the details are our responsibility because we're the tech experts. Unfortunately he  convinced us to offer a 6 month no questions asked refund so he sends the remaining 5 back to us. Because these were hot items, we were able to easily resell them used at cost, so at least we didn't lose money. I'm glad we're mostly out of the hardware business now.",1709,0,1,"Our Point Of Sale tablets are missing, you owe us a refund.

user is so incompetent with tech that she repeatedly puts a Laptop in tablet mode and resets it to factory defaults.,"  

So, this one happened the last week I was at my old job, so I really just laughed it off.

$Me – Me

$Suc – my successor

$user - user

I had $Suc in Training, and as it was my last week I let him handle EVERYTHING, and I solely acted as a resource in case he had questions.

One of our engineers, $user, had requested a Laptop to replace her NUC, so she could do home office from time to time. This was approved by her superior.

My successor had installed the Laptop (and I checked and every configuration was correct) and delivered to  $user.

$user got an E-Mail from us saying that she should check if everything is to her pleasing on the Laptop and then copy all the data she had stored locally over to the Laptop, then have the NUC returned to us.

A few days go by and then $user called:

\-“yes, hi I just started my laptop for the first time and how do I access my e-mails?”

$Suc: “have you opened your VPN?”

$user: “how do I do that”

$Suc facepalms already: “$user, you got a documentation and a how to with screenshots on how to connect to VPN”

$user: “yes, sorry but I’m terrible in IT, I don’t understand that thing”

$Suc: “ok, could you open Teamviewer and give me an ID so I can remote into the machine and show you?”

$user: “how to I do that?”

$Suc: “there is a link on the Network folder just go to &lt;networkpath&gt; and double click it”

$user: sorry, I’m terrible in IT, how do I access that?

Meanwhile $Suc had put her on speakerphone so I could listen in.

We hear her talking to someone on the other side and then we hear the Woman that’s next to her.

She took over and $Suc remoted in and noticed that somehow $user had set the Laptop into Tablet mode… 

Of course, $user claimed to be innocent and that it has been like this since she first turned it on.

$Suc changed it back to normal and set up her VPN.

We thought that was it, but no. 2 days later $user called again.

\-“yeah, hi I just turned on my Laptop but it’s looking strange again and I can’t access my E-Mail.”

$Suc: “ok, I put a link to Teamviewer on your desktop last time, could you open it”

$user: “sorry I can’t find it”

$Suc: “ok, could you open up a browser maybe and visit Teamviewer.com?”

$user: “no sorry I’m lost I don’t even find a browser on here”

$Suc: “mh… let me think… could you maybe give me your private E-Mail and I send you the direct link to Teamviewer?”

$user: “I don’t own a private E-Mail” $Suc and $me both Facepalm at this… but well

$Suc: “I’m sorry but without the ability to remote in, I’m afraid you’ll have to come by so we can have a look”

$user: “but I’m at home? I’m supposed to work from here today”

$Suc: “yes but as you said yourself, this is not possible for you right now and in order for us to make it possible we need access to your Laptop”

$user was not happy and started swearing at this point, so $Suc hung up on her.

An hour later $user knocked on our door.

$user: “here is the Laptop! Now fix it!” 

$Suc had a look and noticed that, indeed she had put the Laptop back into tablet mode. He reverted that and then noticed that all her programs where gone, also the network did not work nothing…. In fact, this laptop had been reset to factory defaults!

$Suc went on to confront $user, but she just threw a tantrum and claimed innocence.

$Suc: “fine, I’ll reinstall it, here is a temporary Laptop for the time being, it will be done in a couple of hours”

Per my recommendation $Suc also informed her supervisor at that moment about what had happened.

Turned out, her supervisor did not give her permission to work from home that day, so she git reprimanded on the spot as well.

$Suc reinstalled the Laptop, we tested it completely, rebooted several times, and he returned the Laptop to her after setting her up her VPN while she was next to him.

One day later, the phone rings, it is $user: 

“yeah, hi, wth is with this shitty Laptop guys, again there is nothing on it, no programs, and the “tablet view” as you said is on again”

This is when $suc lost it: “well then fix it, you seem to be tec savvy enough to turn it on and even to reset a Laptop back to factory default. I won’t fix your Laptop again, bye” and he hung up, then informed her supervisor.

Sadly, this is where the story ends as I had my last day after this, but apparently of what I’ve been told, she just returned the Laptop the week after and continued to work in office with her NUC…",1557,0,1,"user is so incompetent with tech that she repeatedly puts a Laptop in tablet mode and resets it to factory defaults.

'New Account' and 'Log In' are the same thing right?,"My job role was recently made redundant and I was given a position in a different government department doing something very different that amongst other things, involves offering basic tech support for an online account system. I'm learning a lot, including not to trust users when they tell me they've followed my instructions. 

The people that access these accounts own their own company or work within the finance or HR departments of a company so I assumed that basic computer literacy and language comprehension skills would be common. Never assume.

There's two types of accounts you can have; user accounts and company accounts. You need a user account in order to log into a company account. 

I had a 55 minute call today with a genuinely lovely, yet flustered lady who would not listen to what I was saying. It went like this (paraphrased from memory and edited to be non specific):

Lady: I'm trying to add my email to the account and I can't get in.

Me: Are your getting any error messages?

Lady: There's an error.

Me: No problem, what does the error say exactly?

Lady: It says my email is already in use.

Me: That sounds you already have a user account with that email, I can check that for you.

Lady: I don't have one. My husband has one, he's the one who logs into the account usually but he's not here.

Me: Are you using your husband's email address or your own?

Lady: We have the same email address.

Me: Okay so that's the problem, you can't have two users with the same email address. If you give me another email address I can add that to the company account for you (after passing a security check). You then just need to login to accept the account invitation.

Lady: it's Imclueless@helpme.com

Me: Great so I've sent an account invitation to Imclueless@helpme.com Can you please refresh your email client for me and click the link in the email.

Lady: Okay it's asking me to create a user account.

Me: Don't do that, you have an account, I've just authorised it on the system for you, you just need to log in to accept. Click the log in button and type in your email address and it will let you choose a password.

Lady: It says no invitations exist.

Me: That's strange because the link in the email is a direct link to invite you to the company account. Can you click the link again for me and press login.

Lady: It still says no invitations exist.

Me: Are your sure you're clicking log in and not create new user account? (I was getting rather suspicious)

Lady: Should I create a new account?

Me: (Please don't.) No, you just need to log in to the account linked to the email address you've just given me. That's the email I've linked to your company account. 

Lady: There's no login button.

Me: So when you click the link in the email I sent you it should bring you to a page. Don't click anything accept the link and let me know when you're on that page. 

Lady: There's no invitations. I don't understand why it's doing this!?

Me: Did you click anything other than the link I gave you? 

Lady: No it just keeps saying no invitation. 

Me: It wouldn't say that unless you click log in or new account. Let's try again, open the email for me.

Lady: It's open (I can hear clicking).

Me: Don't click anything yet. Read my email to me.

Lady: To authorize your account you must log in using the link below.

Me: Great, the link should be blue. Just click it once for me and nothing else. Do you see the words log in?

Lady: (I hear clicking) It says no invitation!! The email doesn't work! Can you send me a new one?

Me: Absolutely, you should have that now. Please click the link and nothing else.

We repeated the process with the new link 3 more times. No success.

Me: Right this isn't working so we'll try once more and then I'll have to send this issue to the department's specialist tech team to investigate since your email won't connect to the account.

Please just press the log in button, nothing else.

Lady: I clicked it and it worked, shall I create a password?

Me: Yes please do that!

Lady: Shall I use the same password as my husband?

Me: I wouldn't recommend that, another password would be better.

Lady: It says you have 1 invitation, should I accept? 

Me: Yes! That's perfect, please accept. 

Lady: I wonder why it worked that time and not the others, funny isn't it?

Me: Maybe it heard me threaten it with the tech team.

Lady: Ha!

Me: So is that all okay for you?

Lady: Yes so now I'm in the account can you help me do (insert rather complex financial nonsense)?

Me: Of course, no problem! 

And on the call continued. Still bumpy but much smoother. I think she almost trusted my instructions by the end. 

If you made it this far, you deserve a drink. I definitely needed one.",242,0,1,"'New Account' and 'Log In' are the same thing right? My job role was recently made redundant and I was given a position in a different government department doing something very different that amongst other things, involves offering basic tech support for an online account system. I'm learning a lot, including not to trust users when they tell me they've followed my instructions. 

The people that access these accounts own their own company or work within the finance or HR departments of a company so I assumed that basic computer literacy and language comprehension skills would be common. Never assume.

"Colleagues vs my ""lazy"" scripts.","I am a software engineer in climate controls. An abroad company manufactures controllers (think PLC like) and develops their programming software that we use to program these controllers.

We get daily silly questions from clients who don't even bother to look 2 seconds into their own system like:  
""Why is this unit not running?""  
\- ""Because it gives a malfunction signal to our remote web interface, as you can see when you actually log in""  
""Oh, can't you fix it for us?""  
\- ""No, we can't magically fix the unit for you remotely, you need to have someone present on site to look at the hardware.""

But it gets worse when your own colleagues are starting to show these symptoms too...  
I could say I am a lazy but efficient programmer. If I can spend 30 minutes to write a script to automate something that saves me 60 minutes of work, that's a great deal for me! Besides the custom software with custom program language (that looks a lot like visual basic) which we use to program these units, I have my fair share of knowledge with pretty general and easy program languages such as visual basic.

The units we have to program have a lot of hardware inputs and outputs. Digital, and analogue. And the majority of these analogue signals need to be logged, alarmed, etc. Or when we have a Modbus connection to another party, we have to create a list of all the signals that we communicate back and forth. So you can imagine it becomes pretty tedious and repetitive work to do the same thing for each of these signals every time. Sooo, time to write a script for it!

One day, I saw my colleague was struggling quite a lot with just manually copy/pasting these logging signals one by one, and changing each one by adding some numbers, and doing whatever was needed to make it work for the next signal, and so forth. So I decided to be this nice colleague and tell him: ""Uhhh, you know I have a script that can do this in a matter of seconds, right?""  
BIG MISTAKE!!!

My scripts were nothing more than a very simple .vbs file with a lot of ""shell.SendKeys()"" functions in it. Basically what this does is essentially take over control of your keyboard and start writing letters as if you were typing them yourselves. That means, you have to be careful and actually make sure any kind of text editor was open and active to write in, otherwise the script would start spamming keys and doing all sorts of weird things on your PC as if a horde of cats was walking over your keyboard.

Anyway, all went fine for that one single use... Until some time later, I got a message from this colleague asking why my script wasn't working and why it did all sorts of weird things to his PC. He showed me a screenshot of a text editor that basically looked like Chinese. Uh oh...

I had this problem myself once. It is caused if the script is too fast and the SendKeys function can't keep up and starts writing random characters instead of whatever you want it to write. So I tell him to open up the script and make it slower...  
Colleague: ""How do I do that?""  
Me: ""In between each SendKeys function, change the Sleep method to make it wait longer""  
Colleague: ""I already did that. I changed it from 1000 to 100 or even to 10""  
Me: ""\*Siiigghhhh\* It's a sleep command. So if you need it to be slower, you need to RAISE the number, not lower it..."" (Me thinking: Jeez, how can this guy call himself a software engineer if he can't even understand simple things like this.)  
Colleague: ""Ohhhh okay...""

Over heating modem,"Like my last story this one takes place over 20 years ago at Big V.

C calls in saying his modem isn't working. I go through all the troubleshooting steps before the guy tells me this...

I pull up the notes from the last call that C made into support and I shit you not this is what they said...

""... advised customer their modem was over heating and to drill vent holes into modem.""

You read that correctly. The last tech told C to drill holes into his modem, so C did so. Straight through the modem.

Because he was told by a tech to do that stupid shit, and the tech actually noted it, we had to send C a new modem. I advised him not to drill through the new one.

Note: the tech that told C to drill into his modem was evidently disgruntled and had told several customers  to  either do dumb shit to the equipment, or would actually make things worse before blaming their OS and advising them to call Microsoft before walking off the floor and out the door.",295,0,1,"Over heating modem Like my last story this one takes place over 20 years ago at Big V.

That's not a disc drive,"Almost 20 years ago I worked at a call center doing tech support for the big V and their dsl service.  Sorry for formatting, on mobile. 

Me is you know who

CC is clueless customer 

So I'm fielding calls one evening and explaining that no your CD tray is not a cup holder to people who shouldn't own computers (yes that was still a thing at the time) when CC calls in.

Me: Thank you for calling Big V dsl, how may I assist you today.

CC: I'm trying to set up my service, but the disc you sent won't run.

Me: I'm sorry to hear that ma'am. I'll be happy to help you get up and running.

So I go through the steps to get CC and her computer online, which surprisingly doesn't take very long.

CC: Great, thank you. One last thing though...

Me: Yes, ma'am?

CC: How do I get the disc out? 

Me: Just push the button on your disc drive and the tray and disc should pop out.

CC: My drive doesn't have a tray.

I'm thinking she has one of those newer at the time drives that just pop out the disc, which she does. 

Me: Have you tried to hit the button on the drive ma'am?

CC: Yes, but the disc doesn't come out.

Now we were not technically supposed to help with customers equipment other that the modem and router, but I try a few troubleshooting methods with her, but sure as hell that disc is not coming out.

Me: I'm sorry ma'am, but there's not much else I can do. You might have to take your computer to a shop that works on computers in your area.

CC: Well I'll just have my son look at it, he built it for me.

*Record scratch*

Out of curiosity I ask her to describe the front of her tower to me. Sure enough there's a thin space between the tower and the CD drive. CC had mistakenly slid the setup disc into that slot thinking it was her CD drive.

Me: Ma'am, that isn't the disc drive, that's just a gap between your computer and the drive.

Cue CC laughing embarrassingly that she couldn't tell the difference between a gap and the drive without her glasses. We end the call with me telling her to have her son remove the disc from the inside of her computer  for her and maybe filling in that gap so something like this doesn't happen again.

I made a user cry twice yesterday.,"I work at an internal helpdesk, a mixed bag of first and second line responsibilities. *LTL &amp; FTP and all that jazz, let's move on.*


*  $Me

* $User = Not me

Distressed $User comes in with an android work phone where the screen is cracked to hell. In the lower right corner you could actually see the hardware below the display itself, like the cellphone equivalent of seeing all the way through to the bone in a fleshwound. *ouch*

$User said her 3yo dropped it on the floor. No problem, she can replace a work phone once a year under the CYOD ('choose your own device') company program.

The issue, however, stems from transferring her pictures on the internal storage (not the sim, that'd be too easy) to her new phone. You see, the damage to the touchscreen was so great it could no longer register most button presses, let alone unlock the phone. Plugging it into a pc with an USB type c cable is also a no-go since I can't see the storage in file explorer unless the phone is unlocked. *Darn*

So at this point I'm trying to gently apply pressure to different parts of the screen to maybe hit that sweetspot where the stars align and it allows the 4 digit pincode buttonpresses to be registered. I made some headway and was able to enter 3 numbers but the last button wouldn't register no matter how much I tried.

Seeing my frown getting deeper $User suddenly bursts out into tears. As it turns out she had just returned from pregnancy leave, and all her newborn pictures are on that phone. *stakes = raised*

While calming her down an idea popped into my head:

""What if you plug in an external keyboard to enter the pincode?""

I send a ping to his computer from my VDAAS and I see he's on the network so I remote in. First thing I always check is the uptime on a computer because,  as you all know,  this can fix a large number of issues. 

I right click start menu and bring up the task manager. I look at the up time. 42 days.. I told him a simple restart would fix his issues. He said no then ordered me to fix his computer. 

I did an Office repair and told him afterwards he'd have to restart to finish the repair.  He said about time and hung up before getting his ticket."

"""I can't get on VPN!""","Hey all. LTL FTP

I used to be a on site tech for years and I'm now level 3 supporting 2000 users at a major company in my local area.

Due to Covid19 all possible users are remote which means VPN fun!

OK. Can you look at the cable to see if the light is blinking?

One moment. (I try to remote in or find it via our RMM. No dice.)

Leave the money on the counter and you better not be there when I arrive,"This customer was just rotten and add to that a server crash. Looking back, I think he was going through some tough times because 15 years later he's a decent guy. But while he was a steaming pile of poop . . .

This guy owned a hotel and was cheap. I know, shocker! We should have known there was a problem when he started crossing out parts of the support contract like the part requiring him to maintain an on site backup if they don't use ours. We had a really old backup app that we installed anyway because it's better than nothing. We no longer support it and it was just there because he refused anything else.

A couple years later the peak vacation season of that year is about to hit them in 2 days and the server crashes. They have no backups. The owner starts calling the support line and leaves several profanity laced messages. Then he emails sales and support demanding that we come fix his mess. Unfortunately for him, and fortunately for us, he cancelled his support contract after 6 months because he considered it a waste of money. The person on call emails him to let him know that he has no support contract and doesn't use our backup service, so he'll need to contact his IT professional for assistance. This sets off a few profanity laced emails in which he insults several of us by name and the company in general for taking his money all these years but providing no help. He hadn't paid us a penny in a couple years.

Our CEO gets wind of this because he likes to check in on the support mailbox from time to time and tonight was one of those nights. He tell us to let the customer know he will not be helped and that any number he calls from will be blocked because of his abusive attitude. Since I've had the most interaction with this guy and was involved in the install, I'm picked to break the good news. But I have a thought. I remember that we installed that old, unsupported and unreliable backup and maybe it's still running. I propose to the CEO that I write up a short contract stating that I will come to his hotel representing myself, not my company, which has chosen to sever ties with him. The CEO agrees to this and tells me to go for it.

I write up the short contract and add a couple things. 

* I will be paid $500 whether or not I can find the data. 
* I will use only software tools already installed on site, so no data recovery apps or hardware recovery services. 
* I will work a maximum of 6 hours.
* He will leave the money in cash form in an envelope on the counter at the front desk.
* A signed copy of the contract will be in that envelope.
* He has to leave the property while I'm there.

He emails back that the money is waiting for me and asks that I be there as soon as possible. I arrive about an hour later and get to work. The server hard drive is making a clicking and grinding noise - I'm pretty sure software isn't fixing this. The guy working that night was there during the initial install and when I asked about the backup we installed, he said that it was still being run. He also said that after they added a second workstation about a year ago, he modified the backup to make a copy on that second workstation. This guy's actions saved the owner's ass. Without the backup tens of thousands of dollars in advance deposit payments would be unaccounted for. All those reservations would be gone and he'd have no way to prove who had a reservation or pre-paid without time consuming research. A nightmare for the busiest weekend of the year. Because of this employee's decision to add the second workstation to the destination list on the backup, the only lost a couple hours of work.

In the end I spent about an hour there. I restored the software to the second workstation and even tried installing the server hard drive in the workstation but it was dead.

Another Shortcut Story,"Desktop Shortcuts have been the bane of my existence for years. I do not understand the mental capacity of a person that can not do their job without relying on a shortcut to do the most simple tasks.

So I get a ticket from a manager ""Jane is having a problem connecting to the corporate server. Please give her permission. I sent her a link to the server and she can not connect.""

Well, first off that is not my server to administer so I would have to contact corporate to give her additional rights. Luckily the manager included the link to the folder that she was trying to access. It is something like \\\\CorpServer6\\Production\\Groups\\ProductionAce\\Input. So I follow the link and I immediately go to the folder. So the server is up and someone (me) is able to get into the folder so the link works. 

I can't edit the folder permissions but I can see them. Yep, it is wide open. Low-security risk so no problem having ""Authenticated Users"" with permissions, which of course includes Jane.

Email back to the Manager and Jane for her to call me. With so many people still displaced by Covid, it is easier for her to call me than me chase her down. The phone rings and she explains the problem that the shortcut he emailed don't work.

I remote her machine and have her show me what she is doing. She opens his email showing a path to where the folder is. She clicks and tries to drag the texts of the address path to her desktop. 

""Uhhhh, Jane. Why don't we go to the folder first? Do you see that the address is highlighted in blue with a line under it? Well, that means it has a live hyperlink associated with it. Just click on it.""

She does and the computer magically follows the hyperlink to the server and she is in. ""What did you do?""

""Nothing. You just clicked on the hyperlink and the computer went to the address.""

""Well, you make me sound dumb when you say it like that.....""

Me: long pause..... ""Well just make a short cut on the desktop so you can get back here when you need to.""

Working in a 2 man IT dept for a $7 billion company

Marketing Manager outsourced all the heavy lifting to a design firm, they didn't really do much but take credit.  IT Manager believed in insourcing, and that's what we (IT) did.  They just did not get along due to philosophical differences.

Marketing told me what they needed to ask $Design Firm to make a wallpaper.  I advised resolution, file format, etc.  It was made clear to me by IT Manager my role was to do as little as possible (had bigger fish to fry than a wallpaper).

So marketing sent me the image.  I told them to put it in a Jira job and I'd deploy it next time I did server patching on a weekend (as I could force restart workstations on a weekend- I was told all devices must have the wallpaper at the same time for consistency). 

The fateful weekend came around, I opened my Jira queue and got to work.  I deployed the wallpaper, knowing it would take a bit of time to get deployed around all the workstations. 

After it was deployed, I realized the wallpaper was predominantly white.  Do you know what else is white on a desktop?  All the text on desktop icons.

Fuckity fuckity fuckity fuckity.

Called marketing manager - no surprise she didn't answer (once again heavy lifting outsourced).

The PPT Wizard,"*new user so sorry if this post is clunky. TLDR below. Also, not in tech support, but was expected to work as such because I’m young and can make a spreadsheet...

Cast:
Moi - the protagonist
PM - project manager I worked with, nice guy but... you’ll see. 

I used to work as a mechanical design and CAD operator for an industrial kitchenware fab company. Our ops worked basically like this: clients tell the PMs what they want, PMs tell me what the client wants, I make a 3D model of the products and floor plan for the product placements, PM takes credit and closes the deals. 

I’m busily working away making a new model, when PM comes up behind me. 

PM: are you busy? I need some help with PowerPoint. 

Moi: sure thing! What’s the problem!

PM: *deep sigh* I need to make a new introductory presentation for some new clients I want to take on. I’m trying to take the text from our standard intro presentation, but I can’t highlight the text! I’ve been at this for an hour, I’m going insane!

At this point, I’m wondering why he didn’t just retype it, but PM’s a good guy so I’m not about to call him out. I take his laptop and start looking through the ppt. Sure enough, I can’t highlight any of the text either. 

Then, I notice that when I try and click the text the picture editor tab shows up! THIS POOR PLEB HAD BEEN CLICKING AND UNCLICKING A PICTURE FOR OVER AN HOUR. 

I look up at him, still frustrated and unaware of what I’d learned. I get real quiet and say:

Moi: uh, PM, you won’t be able to click this text. 

PM: UUUUUGH why not!? It’s just a PowerPoint, it shouldn’t be this hard!

Moi: it’s because this isn’t text 

I then proceed to resize the image and change the colour contrast. HE GOES RED IN THE FACE. His eyes get wide. His mouth hangs agape. I could tell he felt both humiliated and also terrified, because I’m the only one who knows. 

He grabs the laptop from in front of me, tucks it under his arm, and turns to go. He stops right before and asks for me to keep it to myself. And I did!....for 6 years!...sorry mate! He didn’t talk to me ever again unless he had to, which sucks cuz he was chill.

Also, not in tech support, but was expected to work as such because I’m young and can make a spreadsheet...

Cast:
Moi - the protagonist
PM - project manager I worked with, nice guy but... you’ll see. 

I used to work as a mechanical design and CAD operator for an industrial kitchenware fab company. Our ops worked basically like this: clients tell the PMs what they want, PMs tell me what the client wants, I make a 3D model of the products and floor plan for the product placements, PM takes credit and closes the deals. 

I’m busily working away making a new model, when PM comes up behind me. 

PM: are you busy? I need some help with PowerPoint. 

Moi: sure thing! What’s the problem!

PM: *deep sigh* I need to make a new introductory presentation for some new clients I want to take on. I’m trying to take the text from our standard intro presentation, but I can’t highlight the text! I’ve been at this for an hour, I’m going insane!

At this point, I’m wondering why he didn’t just retype it, but PM’s a good guy so I’m not about to call him out. I take his laptop and start looking through the ppt. Sure enough, I can’t highlight any of the text either. 

Then, I notice that when I try and click the text the picture editor tab shows up! THIS POOR PLEB HAD BEEN CLICKING AND UNCLICKING A PICTURE FOR OVER AN HOUR. 

I look up at him, still frustrated and unaware of what I’d learned. I get real quiet and say:

Moi: uh, PM, you won’t be able to click this text. 

PM: UUUUUGH why not!? It’s just a PowerPoint, it shouldn’t be this hard!

Moi: it’s because this isn’t text 

I then proceed to resize the image and change the colour contrast. HE GOES RED IN THE FACE. His eyes get wide. His mouth hangs agape. I could tell he felt both humiliated and also terrified, because I’m the only one who knows. 

He grabs the laptop from in front of me, tucks it under his arm, and turns to go. He stops right before and asks for me to keep it to myself. And I did!....for 6 years!...sorry mate! He didn’t talk to me ever again unless he had to, which sucks cuz he was chill.

$departingOwner$newOwner$myBoss, who used to be reasonably proficient in $desktopDB development and support but is more into management these days$certifiableMe, certified in multiple versions of $desktopDB software platform

**Situation**

1. Company takeover. $departingOwner leaving to spend more time with his ~~money~~ family, $newOwner with ideas to take the business places.
2. $desktopDB database system to run the company’s operations. Developed in his spare time by $departingOwner. He knows his business, but has shaky $desktopDB skills.
3. Very old, very unsupported version of $desktopDB Server, running on very old, very unsupported version of Windows Server, running on very old, very unsupported Dell server on site.

**What could possibly go wrong?**

It starts with a call one sunny late-November Tuesday to $myBoss from prospective $newOwner. He’s in the process of taking over $company that runs on a $desktopDB database system. The system was built and developed by $departingOwner, and $newOwner knows his limitations (especially in that he knows diddly-squat about $desktopDB software). $myBoss sends me to $company and I give the system a brief once-over in the presence of $departingOwner. Meanwhile, $myBoss discusses future plans with $newOwner, including migration from dodgy on-site out-of-support server to a cloud-hosted arrangement.

Over the ensuing week-and-a-bit, the deal is gradually finalised. After much to-ing and fro-ing, I get word that the Friday afternoon is it. SO I rock up, get the master passwords from $departingOwner and change them all. This takes a while, since this is a $desktopDB system that started life many years before when it had a one-table-per-file architecture. That means that this system has 25+ separate files, each requiring a password change. Tedious and time-consuming, but straightforward enough. Finally, I’m done with the $desktopDB security changes. I double-check that all other system-related credentials supplied by $departingOwner are valid, trigger a backup of $desktopDB system, and copy completed backup to the office NAS.

After a relaxing weekend, I’m about to leave for the office when I get a panicked call from $newOwner. Sometime over the weekend, the very old, very unsupported server has dropped its bundle. It will not start up. It has power, and fans whirr, but it cannot boot.

If you’re thinking to yourself, “Aren’t you glad you copied that backup to the NAS on Friday?”, go straight to the top of the class.

So I jump in my car and head for the $company offices. While on the way, $myBoss calls to get a situation update. The gist of the discussion is that it’s time to fast-forward the migration to the cloud-hosted environment. He heads off to dig through his archives to see if he can find an old license key for the correct version of $desktopDB Server. Turns out he can - we used to provide commercial hosting for that version until about 5 years before, so we have a valid and now-unused license available.

On arrival, I have a bit of a fiddle with the server, but it’s definitely beyond my skill set to deal with. After a brief discussion with $newOwner, he agrees on the cloud migration plan, so I set to work.

After about an hour, I have a new cloud VM running and updated, with the correct version of $desktopDB Server installed and happy, and we’re ready to load up the data. This is where it gets ugly. The office of $company has an extremely crap ADSL internet connection that gets 1Mbps uploads if you ask really nicely. The total database volume is 20+GB. This is going to take a while…

There was a happy ending. We worked out that $newOwner had a good 4G cellular data signal, so I hot-spotted onto his phone to upload the data. Some time later, all is ready, and the users log on. Everything works, and lo, there is much rejoicing. Well, some rejoicing. Performance sucks because (a) see above re. crap ADSL and (b) various inefficient aspects of system design that go unnoticed on a LAN but become \*very\* noticed when there’s a more latency and a slower connection.

Update:

1. There was a better internet connection already planned, and it arrived not long after this, so they weren't suffering for long.
2. We used the Christmas-New Year company shutdown to migrate them to the current, supported version of the $desktopDB platform, complete with properly-secure server-client connections.
3. In the time since, we have made some architectural adjustments to reduce the inefficiencies. It's still not great, but now it's less terrible.",238,0,1,"In which Our Hero saves the day because he thought to take a backup Newish user, first post. Enjoy!

No pressure...,"Here's another story from my time in Cash Register Service.

It's not anything extraordinary, just something that caused me an inordinate amount of stress compared to the actual level and nature of the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

We sold some cash registers to a canteen that sold various items to their clientele.

One day we get a call. One of the machines is down. They only have two so its a big deal for them.

&amp;#x200B;

I go out there and check out the machine. It has a slot in the printer that is usually used for check validation but they are using it for account validation. If any of their clients buy anything, the clients chit gets validated.

So, what happened was the clerks were stapling the chits to the receipts and then sticking them in the slot to validate. After a few months enough of the staples had been torn off by the dot matrix print head to start interfering with the mechanism. Fortunately this printer used a single side trace circuit board or else the staples would have fried the machine.

I clean out the staples and return the machine to service.

Did I mention who the client was?

This was a federal prison.

I had to sign a waiver saying the guards could shoot me if I became a hostage. If I had worn blue pants that day they would have sent me home because I could be mistaken for a prisoner.  I could see a door with a sign on it saying ""Death Row"" from where I was working. If I couldn't get this machine running and the other machine went down the prisoners cannot buy their ramen and cigarettes. No Pressure.

We made a deal with them after that so when it failed the next time they would bring the machine to the minimum security area so I wouldn't have to sign the waiver.

The Plastic Sword,"We got this printer about 3 years ago. Then I moved to a different city and my uncle took it, only to print merely 200 pages and to give it back in a non working condition. They said they got it checked and the person was charging them way too much for it to be worth it. They said it was better to just buy a new printer. And so this printer was just lying in my closet collecting dust for 2 years.

I came back home a few days back to spend some time with the family. I took this printer out today because I wanted to scan some old photos. And I was like what the hell,  I’ll check it once again. 

I started digging through stuff online, and I could only find out that the error code meant there was some mechanical issue. 

Then I started tinkering. First I reinstalled the toner. No luck. Then I picked up a screwdriver, and unscrewed the first few shiny looking screws on the printer. They were holding a metal tray at the bottom. This plastic sword came out of the bottom metal tray. 

The printer is working now. So much for the repair being “not worth it”.

"A tale of spelling, accents, and NATO alphabet","This happened about 5 years ago at my previous job.  I was providing tech support to external customers of $bigSoftwareCompany in Canada. 

A customer calls in to create a new support ticket, but he is not in our system.  

Not a problem, I just need his name and email address to add him, create the ticket and assign it to the appropriate support team.  

This is were the fun starts.  The  customer has an accent from the Pakistan/India/Bangladesh area.  I'm french Canadian so I have a french accent when I speak English. 

The phone conversation happens in English:

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: I need to add you in our system. What is your fist name? 

$Customer: John

$Me: And your last name? 

$Customer: \[Speaking very fast\] Gappabolupabolu (Not his real name obviously, but you got the idea)

$Me: I'm sorry can you spell your last name for me? 

$Customer: ""G""... ""A""... ""P""... 

$Me: ""G""... ""A""... ""P""... 

$Customer: No it's not ""P"", it's ""B""!

$Me: Oh sorry!  so  ""B""... 

$Customer: No it's not ""B"", it is ""B""! 

$Me: ...

$Me: I believe that is what I said. 

$Customer: No you said ""B"", but I said ""B""! Not ""B""!!!

$Me: You mean ""B"" like ""Bravo"" ?

$Customer: No no no, ""B"" like ""Papa"" !! 

(To clarify: he did say ""B"" like ""Papa"" and not ""B"" like ""Baba"")

$Me: Oh I see, so it's  ""P""

$Customer: \[yelling\] ARE YOU DEAF ?? It's not ""P"" it's ""B""!! 

$Me: ""B"" like ""Papa"" ? 

$Customer: YES,  FINALLY !! \[condescending voice\] Is this too hard for you? 

$Me: OK, so ""B"" like ""Papa""... 

I type: ""P""

&amp;#x200B;

This continues for the rest of his name and email. The system then automatically sends him a confirmation email... the longest 30 seconds of my life... 

But in the end I got it right, created the ticket and took a loooong coffee break after that call.

(To clarify: he did say ""B"" like ""Papa"" and not ""B"" like ""Baba"")

$Me: OK, so ""B"" like ""Papa""... 

I type: ""P""

TLDR: Tech support analyst and Customer can't understand each other's spelling because of their respective accents.  They both think the other one is a complete idiot."
Your backup service failed and now you have to pay for our data recovery,"TL;DR  
Customer ignores warnings (emails and phone calls) for almost a year that their backup service is failing and blames us when the server crashes.

Have you ever had a customer that refuses to read emails? We have a lot of them and sometimes it bites them in the ass - hard.

At some point this customer had emailed us asking how to move the software from one server to another, so we sent them links to our help site and offered to assist them since they have a support contract with us. We never hear back and the ticket it closed. A couple months later a technician reaches out to them because their backup service has failed a few days in a row and they hadn't responded to the automated emails that warn them there's a problem. Again, no response from the manager or the IT contact we have for them responded. However, a couple weeks later the backup services started working again. \*Looking back, we believe this is when they reinstalled the backup service.

Maybe a month later there's another problem and the backup result emails are now warning that the data in the backup isn't recent. It lets them know how old the data is and to contact us to troubleshoot, but if they know that no data has changed, not to worry. But just to cover ourselves we contact them several times but never get a response. \*Looking back we now believe that someone brought the old server back online and that the backup was now running on the old server. We can't explain why the new server wasn't also backing up but then again they never told us they actually got a new server and never let us have remote access to diagnose. Hell they never returned our emails or calls either.

And then it gets worse. The backup archives begin to drastically change in size from day to day and often a week or more goes by between successful backups, and those successful backups contain data that hasn't changed in more than 10 months. At this point the email warnings are also telling them the backup archives are broken. After a few more ignored emails from a technician they are called and warned. The manager was too busy to speak with the technician so all they could do is leave a message. The IT guy was also unavailable so a message was left for him as well. We never got return calls. We're pretty sure this is when the server hardware started to fail and incomplete archives were being uploaded.

Then the inevitable happens. The customer who won't address technical issues usually has poorly maintained hardware. Their server crashes when their hard drive fails. No raid? No problem! At least they saved the money for a second hard drive, right? They call and need us to help them recover the data. We ask if they have access to the external drive or NAS that they were backing up to and they tell us that it was just another partition on the drive that failed. So they ignored the warnings and popup box when they set it up. Fine. I check the cloud storage and they still have no valid backups. I'm able to  recover data for them but it's almost a year old at this point. We tell them they need to send the failed hard drive off to a data recovery company.

A week later, yes a WEEK later, the owner of this place calls us. He is pissed and has heard from his manager and IT guy how all of this is our fault and we need to pay for data recovery. We calm him down and explain what has been going on and send him tickets and emails showing how long this has been going on. He gets calls back the next day from the business with the manager and IT guy all on speaker and they each give their best CYA speech. The owner hadn't told them he had documentation yet so he asked why they never responded to emails or calls. The manager says that because we send so much spam that he had to block our email address. Backup results come from a unique address and only send you one message a day, but it looks scary when the backup is failing. He just didn't want to deal with it and flagged it as junk. The IT guy says since it's our service we should have fixed it for them long ago. That's hard to do from 1500 miles away without remote access, especially when you ignore our calls and emails, but, yeah, must be our fault. The IT guy also refuses to address the fact that every day he received an email telling him the backup had old data. 

The owner starts to get a picture of what's been going on and apologizes and asks what they can do now. We tell him that a data recovery service it probably the next step. After that they should follow basic reasonable backup procedures. Yes the manager still works there and the IT guy does as well. They cancelled our backup service though so I really hope they installed something else.",727,0,1,"Your backup service failed and now you have to pay for our data recovery TL;DR

Didn't have the heart to correct her,"This happened about a year ago while working as a level 1 help desk tech at a bank. User calls in stating the printer wasn't working.

I did the customer service bit where I ask about her day, and it was a pleasant conversation before getting to the issue at hand. While conversing I looked up the printer and it appeared to be offline.

Me: ""ok so it looks like the printer is not showing up. Let's go ahead and unplug it and plug it back in"" *insert power cycle fixes everything joke

Which report shows why we're missing so many cases of liquor?,"This was a local customer who, thanks to investors, had more money than brains and hired all his friends to manage some shops in a small high end community. Every month one of the bars is showing thousands of dollars in losses of liquor and they just can't seem to figure it out. Since they're using our software for inventory management, they want us to tell them where all that liquor is going. Unfortunately, all we can do is show them receipts, sales, adjustments and physical inventory. The losses all become evident at each physical inventory so to me the obvious answer is that the liquor is walking out that door in large quantities and nobody is paying for it. 

The money guy scoffs at me and insists that there must be a software bug because there's no way that much inventory gets stolen without him seeing it. He believes that the liquor is being sold but just not recorded. Which of course in my mind should leave you with massive overages in your cash drawer but sales from the POS very closely match the inventory numbers.

So I agree to come out on a busy night and observe things to see if I can figure it out. What I observe is money guy at the bar getting drunk and flirting with the really hot bar manager. He stays in a stupor for the entire evening and can't possibly be keeping an eye on things. I ask some of the other employees if they've seen anything going on that might account for large quantities of missing liquor. One girl tells me that the manager's son often comes in and takes a case or two out the back. This is apparently common knowledge to the employees and their understanding is that the manager's son is simply using the bar to get liquor at cost.

The next afternoon I call money guy and explain what I was told. He speaks to the manager who naturally assures him this isn't happening. I give him the name of the person I spoke with and when he speaks with her she confirms and gives the names of several other employees who also confirm it. The police are called and when this is all over both the manager and her son are arrested. The son managed a small bar and was selling the stolen liquor to his bar. We earned a lot of trust because of this and the money guy realized that getting drunk every night was probably making the liquor theft easier.",2654,0,1,"Which report shows why we're missing so many cases of liquor?

The numbers are off but we've been drinking.,"This honest revelation came from one of our customers who got an early start to a New Year's Eve celebration. They were trying to run the last payroll of the year and noticed that things weren't right and needed to call for help. Thankfully their payroll guy recognized that he was drunk and confessed to us that they had started drinking at about noon and were now too drunk to find the problem. Rather than completely mess things up they all decided they better stop and call us. 

Having pity on them, it was turned over to one of our accounting wizzes and she found that it was a simple matter of missing one of the steps. The payroll guy was able to successfully run payroll, says this is his last official duty of the year and is about to hit the hard stuff and thanks us for saving his butt. About a week later we get a delivery of a basket with wine, cheese, sausages, etc., along with a letter from this company thanking us for helping them even though it was their own fault for being drunk.

“Caller can’t”,"Nearing the end of my shift, it’s raining and I’m not keen to drive in traffic so I decide to work through some tickets sent our way by the global help desk.

A few tickets in, I run into one that looks like 1st line haven’t done their job properly, with a very simple description:

“Caller can’t.”

I’m ready to send it straight back and remind them we need specific details to provide 2nd level support, but decide to check the work logs first in case it’s in there. There are only chat logs for this case, and the user states that the software required to make/receive calls is missing, and our intrepid 1st line support analyst starts investigating but is unable to do much as the documentation isn’t clear.

Customer wants to save money == deletes local profiles off nearly 1000 devices,"TL:DR - Customer wants to save money, screws up badly and we can bill them a lot of money to help

I work for a MSP providing outsourced desktop support for a government agency

One of our guys has developed a script to safely remove old profiles from PC's. It's an advanced script that by default deletes profiles not in use for 90 days or you can specify a date. It  detects known profiles that aren't to be deleted (local PC accounts), detects if the profiles have any office documents or PST files and skips them if they are there and  also logs all the folders and profiles deleted with timestamps and who ran the script to cover our ass

We have been using it ad-hoc for a while but we proposed to the agency that we can package it up and get it to run every 30 days to remove profiles older than 90 days. They declined it due to cost (We would obviously charge them to create the package and for testing etc) and risk of data loss. Fair enough

Fast forward 6 months to last week, and we get a lot of tickets for users profiles being wiped while in use and missing data. They didn't want our script, but decided to get someone internal to write on up and deploy it. Instead of deleting profiles greater than 90 days old, the genuis used delprof to read the last modified date of ntuser.ini instead of ntuser.dat. Ntuser.ini is rarely updated so it didn't matter if you were still logged in actively using it, it deleted their profile based on the age of that file

Nearly 1000 PC's had all their profiles nuked, including ones still in use. Most of them had folder redirection so no major loss of data, but there are at least 100 that I know of that had locally stored data which is now all gone. This includes PST files stored locally, excel spreadsheets, PDF files you name it

"Yes, strawberry fluff is an acceptable payment for on site support.","We had a customer who's since retired and closed his restaurant, but he was one of our favorites not just because he was a nice guy, but because he was down the street from our office and he was an amazing chef. He was the kind of guy that would get stressed and want to see things happen immediately but he was always willing to pay.

The year this happened had been a particularly rough for him and we knew he was hurting financially. He always payed us something even if he was short on cash that month, but he always caught up. He had a grandchild that needed a lot of medical attention so he was spending his money helping his daughter so she didn't have to work while the grandchild was getting the help he needed. He wasn't a saint, but he was close.

His building is really old, in an historic part of town, and one of the older water pipes gets a leak and sprays on some of the computer hardware that's on the bar. He needs to replace this stuff but doesn't have cash on hand and doesn't want to wait for insurance. So he calls us. We have lots of demo hardware sent to us by manufacturers to test and ""certify"" and often they never ask to have it sent back. We offer to let him use this stuff until he gets his finances sorted out. He also requests that we help him get all this set up so we send him a proposal to sign with the estimated cost.

He calls back and says he appreciates the hardware loan but can't afford to pay for setup so he'll send his staff over and they'll pick it up and help him get it set up. We all feel pretty sorry for this guy since we know him well and we want him to succeed. I call him back and tell him that I'll do the setup for him for free since he's been a faithful customer for so many years. He won't accept free service and offers to deliver lunch for 10 with his amazing strawberry fluff desert as payment when we're ready for it. Strawberry fluff is all I needed to hear. I go straight to the boss and it took him about 5 seconds to agree to the terms.

I followed his employees back to the restaurant with the hardware he needed, set things up for them, and then scheduled our fantastic lunch for the next week. That strawberry fluff was the best payment we ever received.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I've had a couple people ask what strawberry fluff is and this is what it is to me.

This was a pie with fluffy graham cracker crust of his own magical design, sliced strawberries and sliced pecans in a heavenly filling. And it was so fluffy - like the clouds the gods must sleep on. It was an experience that's hard to describe with mortal man's words. It was just sweet enough to tickle your dreams but let you eat two slices without feeling guilty. That first kiss from a new love, the gentle cooing of a new born baby, that feeling that only grandma's hug can give - all rubbish compared to this. I dare say you'd sell your soul for another slice if that were the price being asked.",2857,1,1,"Yes, strawberry fluff is an acceptable payment for on site support. We had a customer who's since retired and closed his restaurant, but he was one of our favorites not just because he was a nice guy, but because he was down the street from our office and he was an amazing chef. He was the kind of guy that would get stressed and want to see things happen immediately but he was always willing to pay.

The year this happened had been a particularly rough for him and we knew he was hurting financially. He always payed us something even if he was short on cash that month, but he always caught up. He had a grandchild that needed a lot of medical attention so he was spending his money helping his daughter so she didn't have to work while the grandchild was getting the help he needed. He wasn't a saint, but he was close.

His building is really old, in an historic part of town, and one of the older water pipes gets a leak and sprays on some of the computer hardware that's on the bar. He needs to replace this stuff but doesn't have cash on hand and doesn't want to wait for insurance. So he calls us. We have lots of demo hardware sent to us by manufacturers to test and ""certify"" and often they never ask to have it sent back. We offer to let him use this stuff until he gets his finances sorted out. He also requests that we help him get all this set up so we send him a proposal to sign with the estimated cost.

He calls back and says he appreciates the hardware loan but can't afford to pay for setup so he'll send his staff over and they'll pick it up and help him get it set up. We all feel pretty sorry for this guy since we know him well and we want him to succeed. I call him back and tell him that I'll do the setup for him for free since he's been a faithful customer for so many years.

Locked File on Network Share plus tons of tickets,"Note: Posting this before I forget what happened today.

I got  several emails today about a file on a network share being locked out by about five or so users. I was told to work on this issue, but I don't have access to the user's share, so there wasn't much I could do. It took me few minutes to read through the email chain to get an idea of what was going on. I told the IT person above me on the account that there wasn't much I could do and that a server admin should get involved, which no server admin was on the email chain that I know of. So, with trading emails and IMs back and forth, I included our local server admin on the replied emails so they were in the loop and  to investigate further, since they have more ""powers"" than I do.

The ticket for the issue was not assigned to me, but was provided. 

After going through the above, I pull up the ticket and see what level 2 has done. Reading through the ticket, level 2 only did the common things on the user's PC/asset. When want needed to be done was for a server admin to see what the share location was and what file(s) were involved. Also to see if they could unlock the file. 

The server admin replied to the email chain, asking if the should go ahead do what needed to be done on the server side to unlock or release the file(s).

This has been at a stand still, so I won't have an update until tomorrow or Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides that issue today, I had two user's contact me with their issues, which their tickets were assigned to me, but due to the network share issue, those had to be put on the back burner.

Later in the day, more tickets starting piling in. So, just before I left for the day, with a ""hard stop"" (no OT), I put those tickets into pending status until I'm able to get to those tickets.",25,0,1,"Locked File on Network Share plus tons of tickets Note: Posting this before I forget what happened today.

Got a cheater busted,"So I do tech support for a certain technology company that is named after a fruit. (Names of company and products changed for obvious reasons) this guy called in stating his EyePhone was stolen. His EyeMessages weren’t showing up on his iTablet (your messages show up on all fruit devices including computers if you have fruit Message turned on under Fruit Cloud settings on the devices you want them to capture). So I helped him turn them on.

Had him go into fruit cloud settings and turn on fruit messages sync. They still weren’t showing up. Told him to turn off his iTablet. I sent a “verify” request to verify his identity so I could check on our end to see if his device was signed in and told him it would show up when he turned his iTablet on. He told me it came thru on his “other (fruit phone) that belongs to my girlfriend”. I then educated him on how it is not a good idea to share Fruit IDs and she should have her own. He insisted she did but it’s not possible for two Fruit IDs to be signed in at once.

He turns his iTablet on and notices that his girlfriend’s Fruit Message conversations are now syncing to his iTablet. Further evidence that she is signed in with his Fruit ID. I then reiterate that “these problems can occur when you share Fruit IDs” to which he snaps and insists she isn’t (controlling people tend to make their SOs share Fruit IDs so they can keep tabs so no shocker here)

Then I can almost HEAR the bell go off in his head: “Wait. If I can see her conversations... oh NO. That means she can see mine. I’m so screwed and you have no idea...(mumble)” I say “I’m sorry repeat that?” “You guys at (Fruit) have no idea how bad you screwed me!”

He then demands to know how to have only his messages sync and remove hers. I reply with the only correct answer: “your girlfriend needs to sign out of your (Fruit) ID and into her own”. To which he replied “SHE IS SIGNED INTO HER OWN F*CKING (fruit) ID”. At this point I could have hung up because of the swearing but I was enjoying it too much 😂 and this made it better. Now I get to say “well, if that is in fact the case, then I’m sorry I must speak with your girlfriend then. I can only assist the account holder of the (fruit) ID with Fruit Cloud issues”

He gets even madder. I had to put him on hold because at this point I could not hold back the laughter of him realizing he’s been long caught and his gf just hasn’t confronted him yet 😂😂 then transferred him to Tier 2 (we are allowed to self escalate if “unable to gain agreement” after 5 minutes)

Birthday Wishes,"I was just getting off work when my phone blew up with messages from my housemate. My housemate, $HM had dropped his phone and now the screen was black. It was his birthday, and he could see his phone going off with notifications wishing him happy birthday, but he couldn't access any of the texts to reply. I told him there should be a spare phone in my drawers, and that he should pop it on charge while I drove home.

When I got home we had a look at the old phone. The screen was busted, but it was still clearly working underneath. For most people this wouldn't be a problem, you could just sign in to the new phone and all your cloud saves would pull everything across, but for $HM, it was something else. $HM doesn't use ANY cloud backups. I've helped him recover a lost word file minutes before a due date three times this year, and he still isn't on OneDrive. We needed to find a way into his phone.

Since the start of this year I've been working from home. Pretty early on, I set up my home office to let me swap between my different computers using a USB A dock (which I was surprised to find out existed), and conveniently enough I still had a USB A to Micro USB cable. In one of the shonkiest workarounds I've ever pulled, we remotely installed the DisplayLink app on $HM's phone, and were able to hook it up to my dock. Now, his phone was displaying on the monitor, and he could use the mouse and keyboard to reply to all his birthday wishes.

After the messages were taken care of, we got to work moving the data across. I set $HM up with google photos and contacts, and we pulled across his mobile banking, but we hit a stumbling block. Microsoft and Google authenticators don't display over DisplayLink, as they think its a screen recording software. I started setting up SCRCPY when we ran into a hurdle. We needed to allow the phone to be used like a USB, but to connect the phone to the computer we needed to disconnect it from the display and inputs. In a feat of absolute barbarity topping the previous workaround, I ran downstairs and grabbed the Chromecast. I hooked it up to one of my monitors. Then, using the dock, we cast the screen to the Chromecast. Finally, we were able to disconnect the phone from the dock, but still see the phone's display using the Chromecast monitor.

I'd like to say that we then set up SCRCPY to let us access the phone, but it turns out android doesn't enforce the same security feature on Chromecast as it does on DisplayLink, and we were able to access the authenticators pretty easily from there.

In my last Post to TFTS, I recounted ‘fixing’ an aircraft with [just one hand](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/j0lys8/that_time_i_singlehandedly_fixed_an_aircraft/). Analysis of the Upvote percentage accrued by that post, combined with a perusal of the comments, has led me to take the (perhaps accurate, perhaps justifiable-but-inaccurate, perhaps preposterous - who am I to say which it is, I am not necessarily qualified) position that some readers took umbrage at my verbosity, with several opining that I could have described the events of that brief vignette somewhat more tersely than I actually did; rest assured, dear readers, that your correspondent (and also these stories’ protagonist, at least in most cases; for one of the “most liked” (for want of a better expression) posts I have submitted was my recounting of the tale [told to me by a Frenchman who spent a week in Flyover USA](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/f430vk/you_travelled_from_europe_to_do_what_now/) (and which, I want to make clear, was not in Idaho - “Bumfuck, Idaho” is just an expression used among several people of my acquaintance to denote a place that doesn’t see many visitors), so there is that) has heeded your criticisms - I undertake that, where once I may have been tempted to make a single long, difficult-to-read sentence as if I am being paid to write by-the-word or am endeavouring to create something for the American market replete with exposition others would find superfluous, I shall aim for pith; I shall be laconic rather than loquacious; I will not be garrulous, but rather shall strive for taciturnity; I will baldly state the bare facts where once I might have employed a...shall we say “Baroque”...writing style; I shan’t make cryptic-to-some and obscure-to-many-a-reader references as has been sometimes my wont, but rather - unlike Robert Underdunk Terwilliger Jr. - aim for clarity just like Mr. Odwin in the Wodeshead Retirement Home does (for who knows, maybe not doing so will result in me being one of the first up against the wall when the revolution comes, awaiting summary execution with all the mindless jerks from Marketing). 

&amp;nbsp;

I think I have [burned enough ants with a magnifying glass](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/j0lys8/that_time_i_singlehandedly_fixed_an_aircraft/g74ov6w/?context=3) now, on to the story.

&amp;nbsp;

The events I describe here took place last year. 

This story begins with my looking at the work package for an aircraft that had just been towed inside the hangar for a maintenance visit (the work package is a ring binder full of paperwork laying out what maintenance is to be done and some of the information we engineers need to follow in order to perform said maintenance - it never has everything we need in it). One of the Work Orders (WOs) in the work package said “Copilot Screen Blank” (this is verbatim - for the purposes of this Post I looked up the WO in the computerised maintenance records system that was designed for my employer and which was implemented about a dozen years ago, several years late and several hundred percent over budget).

“What is this ‘screen’ you speak of?” I hear you say. To quote Deane from *[The Curiosity Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curiosity_Show)*, “I’m glad you asked”.  The screen is part of the aircraft’s Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS, pronounced “ee-fiss”, because in aviation we love to convert our acronyms into words); this is a suite of processors and electronic displays that is found in most modern aircraft, which has taken the place of all the mechanical instruments that used to present all of the information to the pilots ([Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_flight_instrument_system)) (fun fact: many helicopters have a tuft of string attached outside the front of the windscreen; this is to show the pilot whether the helicopter is flying straight or yawing. But I digress). A single EFIS Primary Flight Display (PFD) now might have all of the information previously presented by a dozen or more separate ‘steam-driven’ instruments and indicators. In the old days, EFIS systems had small breathtakingly-expensive CRT displays; nowadays they have small breathtakingly-expensive LCD displays.

Anyhoo, as I am sure many of you have experienced in your respective IT careers - with your receipt of trouble tickets such as “printer won’t print” or “computer broken” - I was left wanting more details. As I am sure many of you have experienced in your respective IT careers, more details were unavailable, because the user (in this case the pilot) was now no longer at his workstation. A replacement PFD, if needed, would have to be shipped from overseas and would cost more than ten Northern Hemisphere [kilomonies], which would translate to even more Southern Hemisphere [kilomonies] due to the international currency trade, so it was important that I figure out what was wrong sooner rather than later. 

To this end, I entered the aircraft and powered it up. As the avionics systems initialised, I noticed that I could see information on the copilot PFD, but the display was very dim. I extended my right index finger and pressed the rocker switch in the corner of the display bezel; and the screen became fully bright. I pressed the rocker the other way and the screen returned to its erstwhile dim state. I pressed the rocker a third time until the screen was fully bright again, then I shut down power and exited the aircraft. The time elapsed between turning power on and turning it off again was about two minutes.

The PFD was only visible to me because the aircraft was inside the hangar and it was consequently quite dark in the cockpit. If the aircraft had been outside in full sunlight, the display screen would be too dim to see anything. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is the fun part (for values of ‘fun’ that include ‘fucking tedious and irritating’); once a WO is created in the computerised maintenance records system I mentioned earlier, it cannot be deleted. In addition, by Regulation, all aircraft maintenance has to be done in accordance with a documented and approved procedure; ‘how to adjust the brightness of an EFIS PFD’ was one of the pieces of required information that was not provided in the work package (we have a guy, who is paid less than an aircraft maintenance engineer, whose job it is to create the work packages). So, I then spent almost half-an-hour looking for something that told me how to press the rocker switch to brighten or dim the display; there was nothing in the aircraft maintenance manual, but I eventually found the requisite information - a single sentence in several hundred pages comprising the system’s Pilot’s Operating Guide. With more time to write up in the WO the ‘story’ of what I had done (“adjusted display brightness and system operation checked, found to be correct in accordance with [EFIS system marketing name] Pilot’s Operating Guide Section [Blah]”) added on, I ended up booking 36 minutes in the customer billing system. 

While checking the computerised system to refresh my memory for this Post, I discovered that $Colleague-who-had-nothing-to-do-with-pressing-the-switch had booked half-an-hour to the WO as well, which meant that the customer was billed 1.1 hours for me to press a button.

If all of this wasn’t done on a business jet that cost the owner several million dollars, I might be concerned about the overcharging. That’s not really my problem in the end, it’s my job to push buttons and use ink to make marks on rectangular pieces of dried wood pulp ~~while ignoring Zarniwoop making noise outside~~...

Analysis of the Upvote percentage accrued by that post, combined with a perusal of the comments, has led me to take the (perhaps accurate, perhaps justifiable-but-inaccurate, perhaps preposterous - who am I to say which it is, I am not necessarily qualified) position that some readers took umbrage at my verbosity, with several opining that I could have described the events of that brief vignette somewhat more tersely than I actually did; rest assured, dear readers, that your correspondent (and also these stories’ protagonist, at least in most cases; for one of the “most liked” (for want of a better expression) posts I have submitted was my recounting of the tale [told to me by a Frenchman who spent a week in Flyover USA](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/f430vk/you_travelled_from_europe_to_do_what_now/) (and which, I want to make clear, was not in Idaho - “Bumfuck, Idaho” is just an expression used among several people of my acquaintance to denote a place that doesn’t see many visitors), so there is that) has heeded your criticisms - I undertake that, where once I may have been tempted to make a single long, difficult-to-read sentence as if I am being paid to write by-the-word or am endeavouring to create something for the American market replete with exposition others would find superfluous, I shall aim for pith; I shall be laconic rather than loquacious; I will not be garrulous, but rather shall strive for taciturnity; I will baldly state the bare facts where once I might have employed a...shall we say “Baroque”...writing style; I shan’t make cryptic-to-some and obscure-to-many-a-reader references as has been sometimes my wont, but rather - unlike Robert Underdunk Terwilliger Jr. - aim for clarity just like Mr. Odwin in the Wodeshead Retirement Home does (for who knows, maybe not doing so will result in me being one of the first up against the wall when the revolution comes, awaiting summary execution with all the mindless jerks from Marketing). 

&amp;nbsp;

I think I have [burned enough ants with a magnifying glass](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/j0lys8/that_time_i_singlehandedly_fixed_an_aircraft/g74ov6w/?context=3) now, on to the story.

&amp;nbsp;

The events I describe here took place last year. 

This story begins with my looking at the work package for an aircraft that had just been towed inside the hangar for a maintenance visit (the work package is a ring binder full of paperwork laying out what maintenance is to be done and some of the information we engineers need to follow in order to perform said maintenance - it never has everything we need in it). One of the Work Orders (WOs) in the work package said “Copilot Screen Blank” (this is verbatim - for the purposes of this Post I looked up the WO in the computerised maintenance records system that was designed for my employer and which was implemented about a dozen years ago, several years late and several hundred percent over budget).

“What is this ‘screen’ you speak of?” I hear you say. To quote Deane from *[The Curiosity Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curiosity_Show)*, “I’m glad you asked”.  The screen is part of the aircraft’s Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS, pronounced “ee-fiss”, because in aviation we love to convert our acronyms into words); this is a suite of processors and electronic displays that is found in most modern aircraft, which has taken the place of all the mechanical instruments that used to present all of the information to the pilots ([Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_flight_instrument_system)) (fun fact: many helicopters have a tuft of string attached outside the front of the windscreen; this is to show the pilot whether the helicopter is flying straight or yawing. But I digress). A single EFIS Primary Flight Display (PFD) now might have all of the information previously presented by a dozen or more separate ‘steam-driven’ instruments and indicators. In the old days, EFIS systems had small breathtakingly-expensive CRT displays; nowadays they have small breathtakingly-expensive LCD displays.

Anyhoo, as I am sure many of you have experienced in your respective IT careers - with your receipt of trouble tickets such as “printer won’t print” or “computer broken” - I was left wanting more details. As I am sure many of you have experienced in your respective IT careers, more details were unavailable, because the user (in this case the pilot) was now no longer at his workstation. A replacement PFD, if needed, would have to be shipped from overseas and would cost more than ten Northern Hemisphere [kilomonies], which would translate to even more Southern Hemisphere [kilomonies] due to the international currency trade, so it was important that I figure out what was wrong sooner rather than later. 

To this end, I entered the aircraft and powered it up. As the avionics systems initialised, I noticed that I could see information on the copilot PFD, but the display was very dim. I extended my right index finger and pressed the rocker switch in the corner of the display bezel; and the screen became fully bright. I pressed the rocker the other way and the screen returned to its erstwhile dim state. I pressed the rocker a third time until the screen was fully bright again, then I shut down power and exited the aircraft. The time elapsed between turning power on and turning it off again was about two minutes.

The PFD was only visible to me because the aircraft was inside the hangar and it was consequently quite dark in the cockpit. If the aircraft had been outside in full sunlight, the display screen would be too dim to see anything. 

&amp;nbsp;

This is the fun part (for values of ‘fun’ that include ‘fucking tedious and irritating’); once a WO is created in the computerised maintenance records system I mentioned earlier, it cannot be deleted. In addition, by Regulation, all aircraft maintenance has to be done in accordance with a documented and approved procedure; ‘how to adjust the brightness of an EFIS PFD’ was one of the pieces of required information that was not provided in the work package (we have a guy, who is paid less than an aircraft maintenance engineer, whose job it is to create the work packages). So, I then spent almost half-an-hour looking for something that told me how to press the rocker switch to brighten or dim the display; there was nothing in the aircraft maintenance manual, but I eventually found the requisite information - a single sentence in several hundred pages comprising the system’s Pilot’s Operating Guide. With more time to write up in the WO the ‘story’ of what I had done (“adjusted display brightness and system operation checked, found to be correct in accordance with [EFIS system marketing name] Pilot’s Operating Guide Section [Blah]”) added on, I ended up booking 36 minutes in the customer billing system. 

While checking the computerised system to refresh my memory for this Post, I discovered that $Colleague-who-had-nothing-to-do-with-pressing-the-switch had booked half-an-hour to the WO as well, which meant that the customer was billed 1.1 hours for me to press a button.

If all of this wasn’t done on a business jet that cost the owner several million dollars, I might be concerned about the overcharging. That’s not really my problem in the end, it’s my job to push buttons and use ink to make marks on rectangular pieces of dried wood pulp ~~while ignoring Zarniwoop making noise outside~~...

Customer: “I’m a NETWORK ENGINEER”,"Finally have something to post. Head ups it’s a novel. Kinda fits in r/amitheantagonist, too IMO. I’ve been doing tech support for a few years now, but my new job is by far the most advanced networking I’ve had to do. That being said, I’m far from a network engineer but I know my way around a computer or two. This particular instance was nowhere near the scope of work we have to handle on a normal day. 

The company I work for now sells multiple small devices that have an LED on them. These small devices require an internet connection or they will not work. The main one has to be hardwired to the modem/mrc/ont in order to send out a signal to the other small devices around your house. Like most things in technology, the LED will change colors to tell you what’s wrong. We also have an app.

White = everything is fine 
Yellow = you pressed the reset button 
Red = something is wrong 
 
This customer was over email, not the phone. Which is already a challenge as it is. We’ll call him TB Answers are shortened. 

TB: I keep getting a red light. It keeps telling me it could not get an internet connection to my ISP. It happens a lot. I have to always turn it off and turn it back on to get it to work again. First it’s the main one and then the others go red too.

Me: thanks for reaching out and sorry about the delayed response. You stated that your devices are giving you a red LED. I checked your network history and noticed that there were some outages on your ISP side. (Proceeds to ask customer general questions we ask when someone says something like this, i.e how far apart are they, how does the power cord look etc). While I’m waiting to hear back from you on that information, please go ahead and swap the device that you currently have connected to your modem and use one of the other small devices there instead. Also turn your modem off for 3 minutes and then it back on. 

TB: (Answers my general questions). No. The issue is with the device. When the red light comes on it doesn’t respond. It happens to all of them. I don’t want wanna swap them. I like them where they are. Why are they becoming unresponsive? Can I run a test other than the app? It’s useless when the red light comes on. 

Me: Thanks for getting back to me on this. The reason why the other units display a red light when the main one does is because they need the main one in order to establish a connection to the internet. If the main one is not getting internet and is showing a red light then the others will also. Please try swapping them so we can determine if something is wrong with the main device, the location or the network in general. If you don’t want to do this on your own you can give us a call so that we can help. 

TB: i understand but why is the device becoming unresponsive? When the red light is on it’s not responding. 

Me: thanks for being so patient. The red light is causing the device to be unresponsive because it is not getting an internet connection. We can start eliminating possible reasons why once you complete the swap of the devices I mentioned earlier. 

TB does not respond for 2 weeks. 
TB: I swapped them and I’ll see how it goes 

Me: Thanks for keeping me updated on this! After a day or two please let me know the results. 

TB: so far everything has been good. Switching them fixed it! Can you explain why that worked? As a consumer, what options do we have as far as figuring out what’s going on with our devices? 

Me: (explains why that worked to cx). In regard to tools you can use, the only tool that we have on our end that you don’t have access too is network history graph that shows us where the outages are coming from. We use mostly process of elimination to figure out what’s going on. (Gives cx examples of questions we ask to determine what’s going on with someone’s devices). 

TB: (literally answers the questions even though they were just examples, fair enough. I kinda walked into that one). There are no outages from my ISP. 

Me: if all of your devices are displaying red that is an indication that there is a loss of communication coming from either the ISP down to the main device or an issue with the main device communicating with the other devices in the house. I checked your history from prior to when we fixed it and noticed over 14 outages during the last few days. It could be something small like maybe they were doing work on a nearby line. Next time you get an outage, try to hardwire something else to your modem to confirm that you are not getting an internet connection in general. 

TB: when they went down all had the red light. I tried to ping the device and it wouldn’t work. When the red light comes on, the devices do not respond. This is not normal. If there is an outage from the ISP why should I lose my network? The devices are crashing.

(At this point I felt like I was literally talking to a brick wall. I really decided to dumb it down this time and repeat myself 6 times in 7 different ways). 

Me: if there is a network outage on the ISP side, that means that they can not give you wifi. As a result, your devices can not give you wifi. Therefore, you will have no network to ping. We can only give you what we are getting. Our devices are a car and your ISP is the gas. A car can not run without gas. If your main device is not getting gas, it can not drive to the other devices you have in your house. I see that there are a lot of outages coming from your ISP. If you do not want to take my word for it, if you notice an outage again, I suggest hardwiring something to the modem to test this out. If there is no internet being provided, we can not give you wifi that is not there. If there is not wifi being provided, the devices will have a red light - starting with the main one and going to the others. Once you have contacted your ISP please let us know.

TB: I am not talking about my internet access. I am talking about the network integrity. A failure at pinging the device has nothing to do with the ISP. If I can’t ping from inside my network that is a problem. The devices are crashing. Why do I have to power cycle the devices when my ISP drops? I understand that no connection to the ISP means no internet but I’m not talking about that. My devices are crashing. Give the ISP argument a test and focus on why my devices are not recovering from an ISP outage. 

Me: thanks for getting back to me on this. I understand where you are coming from. (Explains how during the set up process when you initially get the devices requires them to power cycle their modem). This is why during an ISP outage, you have to power cycle your devices. The odds of all 3 of your devices being defective are incredibly slim. However, if you refuse to speak with your ISP or refuse to try any additional troubleshooting there is nothing that we can do. You are currently still within your warranty and can get a replacement if one is found to be required. However, due to all the ISP outages, the department that approves replacements will ask you to contact your ISP. As soon as you contact your ISP please let us know.

TB: First and foremost you have not read my responses to you. If we are going to flex intellect, per the tone of your email, then let’s go ahead and do so. I have been very patient. I have only asked questions about what I observed since i am a NETWORK ENGINEER. this is not normal. The device is crashing! Facts are facts. Our app is no longer available when they crash. You can’t ping any of the devices when they go offline. You have to turn them off and back on. IS THIS NORMAL???? You have not read my responses and I DO NOT APPRECIATE YOUR TONE. I need a solution to this problem and unless there has been a product update between when I reported this issue to now the problem still exists. So regardless of your WARRANTY threat if the issue is unresolved then you are obligated to resolve it.

(At this point I feel like I’m in the twilight zone) 

Me: thanks for getting back to me on this, I appreciate you taking the time to do what you can. I apologize if my tone is being presented in a way that is not appealing. I am not able to speak with you causally and have to use certain words or phrases in response to you. As a result, I may be coming off as robotic or callous. I do indeed want to resolve this problem for you or answer any questions that you have about the device. The answer is yes it is normal that if your ISP has a drop that the devices will need to be rebooted. I agree that this can be an inconvenience. However, yes. It is normal. I would also like to assure you that I did indeed read all of your emails. 

TB: I appreciate your response but when the ISP drops, it should not be normal to have to reboot the devices. If so, I would always have to reboot my computer. If this is the case, I want to return all of them if they do not fix this even though I have had them for a year.

I don't trust anyone who responds to emails at the speed of light.,"Working on a client request to upload some contacts into his account (CRM tech support). Pretty standard.

For some quick context, we can upload as many contacts as you want, but it obviously takes longer depending on how many are in your file. Also, to upload contact files from a spreadsheet, we have to assign the spreadsheet columns to fields in the system using our little upload program. Which means that clients are supposed to put their contacts' info in relevant columns - one column each for the name, phone number, email address, ect. 

This client in particular was feeling a little frisky that day.

* Had over 20k contact records. Thanks, I hate it.
* File was a mess. Names in the ""Phone Number"" column, random strings of text in the ""Email"" column, bits of address info just scattered throughout the entire thing. It was as if Jackson Pollock had a fight with Microsoft Excel and won. No way the upload tool was going to accept it.
* Half these contacts didn't have names or contact info, just descriptions. Contacts do have to have at least a first or last name in order to be uploaded. 
* Ticket titled ""URGENT"" (automatically puts you in my personal Sinner's Queue as last priority)

So I send a detailed email letting him know everything wrong with the file and what he needs to fix before it can be uploaded. Close ticket, X out of ticket, move on to other work.

Before I'm able to actually move on to anything else, I see a ticket reopened notification in my inbox. Guess who.

""Yes please upload the contacts as specified, it is very urgent thank you."" 

I squint at the timestamp on the ticket. 32 seconds between me closing the case and him responding. My dude either has some wild thumb speed or he responded with his mind. I wait about 30 minutes before replying back with the obligatory ""per my last email"" and copy/paste my response.

30 minutes in the Sinner's Queue didn't cool him off, as he responded around 25 seconds later.

""Contacts are exactly how I want them now please upload, it is very important""

I go to lunch for an hour. Return and reply back letting him know that I physically can't upload his contacts until he makes the changes I asked for.

44 seconds later, ""I looked over the file before I sent it, everything looks good, I want this uploaded immediately"" 

It's at this point that he goes into Level 2 of the Sinner's Queue while I get to other tickets/calls. Level 2 means you might get a reply from me by end of day, if not, I'll get to you tomorrow sometime. Please find something to do other than refresh your inbox every half second.

At some point, Speedy sent in three or four new tickets to the queue, all just 20-30 seconds to a minute apart angsting about his contacts not being uploaded. A coworker of mine finds them, and sees that I was already working with him. We chat a bit, and she figures she'll respond in the hopes of hearing the same thing from two different people might knock some sense into him. She also included a screenshot of my email, highlighting the bits detailing the changes we need and the reasons for them.

Shockingly, Speedy doesn't respond for *three whole motherfuckin' minutes.* Maybe the downs finally kicked in.

""I did not see that part I am sorry. I will look at this and get back to you.""

The first line of my email said something along the lines of ""Hi, \[Customer\], I was trying to upload your file, but there are a few changes we'll need you to make first."" I can only guess that he read this line and just stopped processing inputs altogether.

TL;DR: Chucklefuck prides himself in responding to emails faster than he can mentally process them.",2823,1,1,"I don't trust anyone who responds to emails at the speed of light. Working on a client request to upload some contacts into his account (CRM tech support). Pretty standard.

For some quick context, we can upload as many contacts as you want, but it obviously takes longer depending on how many are in your file. Also, to upload contact files from a spreadsheet, we have to assign the spreadsheet columns to fields in the system using our little upload program. Which means that clients are supposed to put their contacts' info in relevant columns - one column each for the name, phone number, email address, ect. 

This client in particular was feeling a little frisky that day.

* Had over 20k contact records. Thanks, I hate it.
* File was a mess. Names in the ""Phone Number"" column, random strings of text in the ""Email"" column, bits of address info just scattered throughout the entire thing. It was as if Jackson Pollock had a fight with Microsoft Excel and won. No way the upload tool was going to accept it.
* Half these contacts didn't have names or contact info, just descriptions. Contacts do have to have at least a first or last name in order to be uploaded. 
* Ticket titled ""URGENT"" (automatically puts you in my personal Sinner's Queue as last priority)

So I send a detailed email letting him know everything wrong with the file and what he needs to fix before it can be uploaded. Close ticket, X out of ticket, move on to other work.

"""I've used it on iPhones so i'm sure i'll get the hang of it""","It's a nice sunny Thursday morning in October. The birds are singing, the sun is shining, and the kettle is whistling...

Who am i kidding, it's pissing down with rain and we've run out of milk.

With the outside world, and my coffee, looking blacker than my soul, my boss turns around to bless us with good news. 

""Did you hear that Carys up in admin has asked for a Macbook?"" she asked me.

""No, why the heck does she need a Macbook?"" I reply, with a great  deal of skeptism.

You see, much like many other government-run establishments, we're very heavily invested in Microsoft, with an AD network, domain, and site-wide deployment of Windows 10. Macs are not on our RADAR, and i'm the only person in the IT department who uses one on a regular basis. There's no way in hell i want one of these things on the network though. I use a Mac so i'm not reminded of work. 

""Carys is struggling to edit videos on her iPhone, so she's asked for a Mac. Apparently it's all authorised and just needs ordering and picking up from Lewis John's"" replies my boss, with an equal amount of exasperation. 

""As long as it doesn't come out of our budget, and we're not expected to support it, sure."" 

My boss agrees, ""Yeh, we're not going to be putting it on the network, that's just opening a whole can of worms""

""I mean, we *can* put it on the network, but i don't think Carys will get on with it when we wipe it and put Windows 10 on it instead"" I reply, definitely not hiding the evil chuckle. ""where'd they get the money for all this anyway, i thought we were strapped for cash? How is it i can't have £3k to put into buying SSDs for all our deployed computers, but magically there's £2k to spend on a Macbook for one person?""

After resigning ourselves to the fact that we're going to be getting a Mac, something in the back of my mind reminds me of one i saw somewhere else.

You see, i was lying when i said we had no Macs. We did, indeed have one singular Mac Pro in one department, which has been languishing unused for the best part of a decade. I mention this to my boss, who then does the needful and informs Carys of the newfound fruitputer. 

Now this thing is positively ancient. It's an original cheesegrater Mac Pro, running Core2Duo era Xeons, and boots Mac OS X Lion, so this thing probably hasn't been updated since it was donated to the department it was found in. Buuut, crucially, it has iMovie on it, which is what Carys wanted to edit her videos on. 

I get the green light to move this thing up to Carys' office. But firstly, i want to quickly run updates on it, to at least get the Lion install somewhere close to up-to-date. I've not upgraded the OS out of fear of breaking iMovie. I put a reasonably modern browser on it, crack the administrator password, and run the updates, before dismantling the beast and sticking it on the trolley.

I lumber up the corridors, catch the lift to the next floor, being careful not to smash up this almost antique Mac, along with polycarbonate keyboard, Mighty Mouse, and an Apple Display with bezels the size of a childs forearm. I'm weaving in and around staff, door frames, multi-function copiers and random furniture like it's an obstacle course, before i arrive outside Carys' office.

As i'm setting this behemoth of aluminium and dispair, Carys keeps commenting on how it's such a nice machine and how it will make it so much easier to edit her videos. I'm just nodding and agreeing, thankful that i've save the organisation around £3k by repurposing this boat anchor. 

After it's all set up, i start explaining to her that it's a bit old and it might have a few issues here and there.

""Sorry to say, this thing is a bit older, and as such runs Mac OS Lion, but iMovie is there, so it should work for your purposes. Some things on more modern MacOS won't be there, but you should be fine"" 

""Oh that doesn't matter, I've used iMovie on iPhones,  i'm sure i'll get the hang of it"" she replies, ""I've never used a Mac before anyway""",1398,0,1,"""I've used it on iPhones so i'm sure i'll get the hang of it"" It's a nice sunny Thursday morning in October.

Amazing colleagues and technology,"Okay, I do have to clarify this first: I work at a small company without a dedicated tech support. Since I know enough about computers to fix small issues, my amazing colleagues and boss tend to rely on me for first line tech support, though I reiterate that technically I am paid for my regular work.  


That said, I recently had a real gem of a situation that I'd like to share. The thing is, my colleagues and boss are amazing, in that they are amazingly bad at computers beyond using a browser and basic office software like word. Good people, but they combine ignorance with an unwillingness to learn, so that even the simplest issues require me to fix it. Usually after hours as with the current pandemic I and a few others work from home. Not to rail on the office, but the work pc's there are old W7 upgrades over 5 years old and they are due for replacing asap.   


As part of the business, one of my office-working colleagues has to print a lot of invoices for even less tech-savvy customers. For this, let's call her Hannyabal as she has a similar personality and grimace.  Basically, the big printer was running out of ink so I went in and raided the storage for a fitting new toner cartridge... But we were out of that particular one. One quick order later I'm primed to install it at the earliest convenience, but Hannyabal had a bright idea: she could take the delivered toner cartridge and put it in herself. Without telling me ofc. Then:  


H: Hey you, the printer isn't working! You ordered the wrong ink for it!   
me: What are you talking about? I'm due to install the new toner later today.  
H: I'm tired of waiting, so I put the new one in. Its that crap \[housebrand\] ink. You need to fix it!  
me: Did you put it in correctly? You didn't throw away the drum? (again)  
H: Of course! But its not my job, you need to fix it, I've got a big run to do tomorrow! Order some proper ink or I'll complain to (overworked) boss!  


So, I went to the office, retrieved the printer (from the floor!) and looked in wonder. She had in fact managed to take the old toner out and put the new one in. HOWEVER: she had left on all the sealing/packaging materials. The connector ports to the printer couldn't rotate, the toner reservoir was still 'locked' with the seal tab and it had not pegged into the drum properly. Fixed in less than 3 minutes, 3 test prints made (the old toner had dripped on the ink-transfer a bit) and wahoo... its done. Literally, anyone could have done it had they bothered to take a look. Hannyabal was quiet for a while after I informed her of the need to remove these things.  


Frankly, it is times like this that I have the utmost respect for people who work tech support fulltime. They have to deal with this crap daily and with a multitude of weird/rude/idiotic people. I just have to deal with colleagues who are practically technophobes and extremely unhelpful when trying to be 'helpful'.

"Oh I think I found the problem, you have a bad last name.","So this is a fun one I got a few days ago. New hire calling in stating her starting password did not work. Usually these things can be user error from the end user or the account creation side. 

&gt; $me - Good morning. Thanks for calling IT this is #me how can I assist you?  
&gt; $Her - Hey I am a new employee with *our company* and I can not get into our system.   
&gt; $Me - Are you at the windows login screen or the citrix login screen?  
&gt; $Her - Windows.    

I pull up her account and find the new hire spreadsheet. It has each new hire, their email, and one time use password on it. 

&gt; $Me - Can you tell me which PW you are using?  

We can not give out passwords over the phone so I have them tell me their password. 

For this next portion, I will use fake company names and fake default passwords. 

&gt; $her - Parker4545%   
&gt; $me - Hmm. That is what we have on file. Going to open up AD and reset it back to that same password in case someone fat fingered it. 

AD gives me an error. Invalid password. 

&gt; $Me - Strange, it wont let me use that password for some reason. Trying again. 

Again AD tells me invalid password. Strange because this is just a variation of one of many password templates at the company. 

&gt; $Me - One moment while I reach out to an admin regarding this. 

I pull up teams and reach out to account admin. He tried resetting it himself and got the same thing. He pulls in another account admin and gets the same thing. We escalate up to the exchange admin in case its an issue with desynching. He checks everything and he cant figure it out either. 

This chat is getting larger and larger until the sysadmin joins in. 

&gt; $Sysadmin - Well you see guys, the reason you are unable to reset Ms Park's password to Parker4545% is because IT HAS HER LAST NAME IN IT!!!

The chat was silent for roughly 10 seconds and was quickly filled with gifs of people stating they are dumb or gifs of people smashing things into their heads. 

&gt; $Me - Ms Park? (Again fake name)     
&gt; $Her - Yes?  
&gt; $Me - We found the issue.   
&gt; $Her - Oh good. What was it?  
&gt; $Me - Your last name is park. We were trying to set your password to parker, which has your name in it, and that is why it wasn't working.   
&gt; $Her - *Cackling laughter* Oh my god. That is hilarious. How many people did it take to figure that out?  

She asked jokingly. 

&gt; $Me - Way too many.   

I said seriously.",1732,1,1,"Oh I think I found the problem, you have a bad last name. So this is a fun one I got a few days ago. New hire calling in stating her starting password did not work. Usually these things can be user error from the end user or the account creation side. 

&gt; $me - Good morning. Thanks for calling IT this is #me how can I assist you?  
&gt; $Her - Hey I am a new employee with *our company* and I can not get into our system.   
&gt; $Me - Are you at the windows login screen or the citrix login screen?  
&gt; $Her - Windows.    

I pull up her account and find the new hire spreadsheet. It has each new hire, their email, and one time use password on it. 

&gt; $Me - Can you tell me which PW you are using?  

We can not give out passwords over the phone so I have them tell me their password. 

For this next portion, I will use fake company names and fake default passwords. 

&gt; $her - Parker4545%   
&gt; $me - Hmm. That is what we have on file. Going to open up AD and reset it back to that same password in case someone fat fingered it. 

AD gives me an error. Invalid password. 

&gt; $Me - Strange, it wont let me use that password for some reason. Trying again. 

Again AD tells me invalid password. Strange because this is just a variation of one of many password templates at the company. 

&gt; $Me - One moment while I reach out to an admin regarding this. 

I pull up teams and reach out to account admin. He tried resetting it himself and got the same thing. He pulls in another account admin and gets the same thing. We escalate up to the exchange admin in case its an issue with desynching. He checks everything and he cant figure it out either.

A little background, I'm a social worker by trade and just got promoted to local admin because I know some stuff about networks and PCs. I work at a NGO that also operates a school at our location so we have a seperate network for the administration and a network for the schools computer rooms.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple weeks ago I come back from vacation and immediately get flooded by calls, that the schools PCs can't log into the internet and that this needs to be fixed immediately so the teachers can teach their computer science classes...

&amp;#x200B;

Alright, first I decide to take a look at the PCs. I walk over to the closest computer room, and check the cables there. Switch is blinking so I rule out someone tripping over the power cord or similar. I sit down at a PC and do the usual ipconfig and pings.

&amp;#x200B;

First day back at work and down into the depths of the broom closet to pay our server a visit.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here comes the scary part. Hold your breath, there was no server in the broom closet!

&amp;#x200B;

I panic a little bit and bolt towards the head office. My boss is there and she's relieved to see me. I ask her what happened during my vacation and tell her I just found out, there's no more server in the broom closet. 

Oh, right, the central admin was here last friday and did something to the server but he didn't tell me what it was...

&amp;#x200B;

So I make a call and get the assistant of the central admin who tells me that they set up the server in another room because fire regulations etc.

I get to the new server room and to my relief there it is, humming along and clearly connected to the network.

&amp;#x200B;

I ponder for a second and decide to take a closer look. I haul a monitor and some peripherals to the room and get greeted with a black screen. I boot up again and then I see the problem.

The boot sequence was set to boot from the external HD which didn't have any data whatsoever.

I set it to boot from internal HD first and unplug the external for good measure. Lo and behold the server is back up again and running. I connect the external again and all is well.

I told this story to my wife and made her laugh so I decided it might be worth sharing here.

A little background, I work at an NGO as a social worker. I also like building PCs and Networks during my free time, which got me promoted to local admin at work (came with a small payraise though!)

One day I get a call from a coworker. She's a really great social worker but not very tech savvy.

Call goes as follows:

Me = Me

Coworker = Coco

Coco: Hi, Nocuras8, do you know zoom?

Me: Yeah, I've participated in some meetings with this app so how can I help you? *(my mind starts going through common problems with these apps, like a deactivated camera or mic, connection issues etc.)*

Coco: Great, I knew you could help me. So there's this girl from a local university and she wants to do an interview with me over zoom. However I can't log in somehow. We tried troubleshooting it ourselves but when I try the steps she tells me to do it's not doing the same as on her PC. She even sent me a picture how it looks like on her end but I don't even get there.

Me: OK. We'll try and find the step where it goes south and try to find out why. So first you should have an invitation, a link probably in the first mail this girl sent you.

Coco: Yes there are some links. Which one should I click?

Me: Uh, it should be labeled ""invitation"" or ""join"" or something similar and look like ""\[link\]"".

Coco: OK I clicked it and a browser opened but nothing happens. You know what, it says I should not share the mail with someone else but I trust you. I'll send it to you.

Me: Ok I'll have a look. *(Get the mail, click the link, everything works fine)*

Me: Alright it seems to work for me so it might be your browser blocking a pop-up. Do you have any antivirus/anti-anything installed that could stop it from working?

Coco: I have Norton but nothing else.

Me: Good, let's check your browser. *(I navigate her to where she'd be able to see if there was any pop-ups blocked)*

Coco: No, there are no messages, no apps called adblocker or noscript...

Me: Alright, then we'll try it again but really slow and you tell me everything you see before we continue with the next step. First click on the invitation link again and tell me exactly what error your browser displays.

Coco: There's no error but it says ""your download will start shortly""

Me: Great, that's a step in the right direction. Do you see your download?

Coco: No, I pressed ""Cancel"". I don't want any untrusted files on my PC!

*Head meets desk.*

Me: Uh, you kinda need to download the app first to log into it.

Coco: Ah, I see. So the girl from university had a different screen because she already has the app?

Me: Yeah, you could say that. So You want this to work now or not?

Coco: Yeah the interview is scheduled for tomorrow and I even took a day off work to do this. So, I need to actually download this file?

Me: Yeah apparently you need to download the file to start the app.

Coco: OK I trust you, so what do I do?

Me: Click the link again but this time do not cancel. Just press ""save file"" instead.

Coco: Huh, it's doing something! Ah, there's the screen the girl showed me. Ok logging in. Aw, it's still not working. Says they updated their privacy form and...

Me: Just click accept and it should continue.

Coco: Ok I trust you, I clicked it but now there's a whole bunch of browser windows I don't know where they came from...

Me: Hm, were you able to click accept?

Coco: There is no accept just some links...

Me: Alright I think now I actually need a picture of your screen because I have no idea what is happening right now.

Coco: Oh, I know how to do this. My boyfriend showed me!

*So I get a screenshot with lots of clutter open and one clearly visible window from the app, that has the aforementioned text, some links so you can view the privacy agreement etc. in a browser and a big blue button labeled ""CONTINUE"".*

*I ponder for a while and then get back on the phone.*

Me: Yeah, so, do you still have your screen just like in the picture you sent me?

Coco: Yes, exactly like it.

Me: Then close the following windows *(proceeds to list about a dozen apps running that she definitely doesn't need at all)*

Coco: Will that make it work?

*(Me: No, but it'll make me feel better.)*

Me: Yeah, that and clicking on that big, bright blue button that says ""Continue"".

Coco: Oh my god! It worked. I can see myself on screen! I knew I could trust you!

Me: Always glad I can help.

tldr: coworker is confused why the app isn't working when she hasn't even downloaded it yet."
Your software allows me to enter the wrong numbers,"This customer had been complaining for months about incorrect numbers in our software concerning deposit amounts. They were always off, she tells us, and each time we call we ask for some specifics so we can investigate. She never sends us anything and just waits about a week and calls again. Finally, though, she's ready to speak with someone and I'm bored so I decide to call her back and deal with it.

After a few confusing minutes with her I realize that the numbers in question are the daily and monthly deposit variance numbers. She scans and emails be a few examples that have the ""Actual Deposit"" number crossed out and then a number hand written. She explains that the ""Actual Deposit"" numbers are wrong and that the hand written numbers are her corrections. She wants to know why those numbers are never correct and are sometimes off by a huge margin.

Her question is, where to the ""Actual Deposit"" numbers come from and how can we make them correct. This is where I explain that the person closing out for the day is the one that enters those numbers, right before this report prints. She tells me that she's the one who does that and that my explanation makes no sense because she'd know if she were the one entering those numbers. I have her do a test. If you reprint a report for a previous day you have the option of entering these numbers again and overwriting the originals.

She prints the report and I ask her what she entered when asked for the deposit amounts. She tells me that the numbers are different this time, though. I ask her to do it one more time and to stop at each step, selecting the report, selecting the date, entering deposit amounts, clicking the print button. She pauses for me at the report selection, date selection, and then I hear some keys quickly typed, and then she pauses before clicking the print button. I ask her what that typing was and she tells me she really doesn't know. A window pops up and she has to type a bunch of numbers and hit Enter a few times to make it go away. WTF?

For months now she's been flying by these fields without even reading the prompts. It turns out she was new to this position and nobody trained her, but seriously spending 30 seconds reading the screen would have solved this from day 1. I don't even know what to think of this because she didn't care enough to read a popup form asking for deposit amounts, but she was counting the deposits and handwriting the daily figures. She clearly cared about accuracy but not enough to read?

After I explain all this to her she gets a little upset and asks why our software lets her enter the wrong numbers every day. She tells me a computer should be able to detect that the numbers are wrong and warn her. It just never sinks in to her that the purpose of these fields is to allow her to hand count the deposits and enter them so that over / short can be calculated. We end the call with her believing the software is at fault and that she will have to continue hand writing the correct deposit amounts. At least she never calls back about it.",1453,0,1,"Your software allows me to enter the wrong numbers This customer had been complaining for months about incorrect numbers in our software concerning deposit amounts. They were always off, she tells us, and each time we call we ask for some specifics so we can investigate. She never sends us anything and just waits about a week and calls again. Finally, though, she's ready to speak with someone and I'm bored so I decide to call her back and deal with it.

After a few confusing minutes with her I realize that the numbers in question are the daily and monthly deposit variance numbers. She scans and emails be a few examples that have the ""Actual Deposit"" number crossed out and then a number hand written. She explains that the ""Actual Deposit"" numbers are wrong and that the hand written numbers are her corrections. She wants to know why those numbers are never correct and are sometimes off by a huge margin.

NEVER press the shiny red button!!! System upgrade turns into a robbery in progress,"TL;DR at bottom

Back again for another tale of insanity and tech woe’s that dances on the border between stupidly impossible and yet somehow plausible. I was on my way to work tonight and had a pair of cop cars goes flying past me and it reminded me of this story.

This was back around early 2005-6ish, at this time I have about 8 years of experience under my belt and I’m pretty confident in what I know and what I don’t and the difference between the two. I’ve installed/upgraded several network setups and phone systems by this point and I’m fairly confident I know how to pull cables and remove the old crap that has been dry rotting for years in the ceilings and walls. This particular job was a network upgrade to replace the old network drops and land line phone switch system and install IP phones along with a new network switch for the recent fiber upgrade they got. The network “closet” was a 4’x4’ graveyard filled with junk systems, two old phone punch down panels, dead battery backups, and the current systems I was replacing.

This customer was in a small strip mall area that had nice high drop ceilings so install and removal of the old garbage was fairly easy. Cut the old junk at the top of the wall yank it back to the closet, cut it up top, pull the loose junk away from the old systems. I get all the old crap off the wall and loaded into my vehicle to scrap/recycle and started pulling the new cables. I got all the new cables pulled and punched down out in the office.

I wanted to be out of the customer’s way so I decided to setup the new phones and run cables to all the new equipment before finishing the closet. I’m crawling underneath the counters and desks organizing the system cables, my OCD couldn’t let the rat nests alone, while pulling the new cables through.

As I’m under the front counter I come across a small box with a single red button….

*HMM, what could this be I wonder???*

I asked the owner if they knew what this curiosity was and they said they didn’t know. I said it looks like a panic button to call the cops if you were getting robbed and asked if they had a system like that. To the owners knowledge they did not and I had everything out of the closet and nothing I pulled looked like a system like that, they’re usually a wall mounted metal box that’s locked with wires running through metal conduit for protection. I asked if they wanted it left or pulled and they said pull it so I unmounted it, yanked the wires back up through the wall, tossed a wire nut on each of the ends to be safe, coiled it up, and zip tied it to a support beam.

*Obviously I had to press the big red shiny button before pulling it, it’s against the law not press it.*

I want to say about 10-15 minutes pass and I’m currently still under the last station, where the button was, tidying up cables when I hear the familiar sound of police sirens. My first thought was, that can’t be what I think it is… there was no system in the closet… The sirens are get much louder so I pop up from under the station just in time to see two cop cars come screeching to a halt in front of the store.

*OH SHIT!!! I’m in trouble…*

Luckily the owner was much more curious then I was and was already at the front door. She walked outside and one of the officers came over the loud speaker.

Cop=cop
O=owner

Cop: Don’t move!

O: OK!

The second cop had gotten out of his vehicle and was standing beside it ready to draw his side arm.

Cop: Who are you? We got a report of a robbery in progress at this address!

O: I’m the owner of this business, there is no robbery going on. Who called you?

At this point the first officer gets out of his vehicle and approached the owner, cop 2 still standing at the ready. The cop and owner talk for a few minutes and finally he signals cop 2 that it's ok. Cop 2 approaches and all three come inside.

At this point I want to crawl into my tool bag and hide because I know this happened because of that damn button.

Cop 1 explains that an automated system called 911 saying robbery in progress at current address and they needed to take a look around to verify everything was cool. Cop 2 takes a look around as cop 1 checks with dispatch. Apparently the system was calling ever couple of minutes stating the same thing. I explained what most likely happened and ask if it's ok for me to trace the wire I left in the ceiling. By this time cop 2 comes back with an all clear and cop 1 says he will contact dispatch and let them know he's remaining on site till we can find what's making the 911 call. Cop 2 takes off and I start tracing this wire, thank god for wire tone probes. I scamper back up to the wire, hook up my tone box and try and see exactly where this wire is going. Two ladder climbs later and I find the wire is going next door to another business, thankfully owned by the same owner but the other business was run by her son. A half dozen ladder climbs later I find the wire running to a locked metal box in the ceiling above the network closet in the second business. Thankfully the key was hanging in the lock, I know real secure, so I pop it open and hit the kill switch. Cop 1 checks in with dispatch about 5 minutes later and they say calls have stopped.

*THANK GOD!!!*

The owner apologized for the trouble and I do the same, I kept saying sorry the whole time I was tracing the wire, I think the cop was tired of hearing it as he verified with dispatch asked the owner to sign some paperwork, and took off.

The nightmare was over and I asked the owner what she wanted done with the ""alarm system"". She asked if I knew how it worked and how to reset it. I did not and said it looked like it had been here a while, I could try and find info on it but no guarantees. She opted to just have me pull it out. As I was removing it I got curious to  what phone line the system was even using haven been hiding in the ceiling for so long, how did it have a live number to use? So I grabbed my handy old fashion land line phone and dial my cell phone. Turns out it was tied into the line her sons business was using as a fax line. The system was plugged into an outlet above the ceiling, I'm guessing this was installed a while back when it was another business was at this location. Turns out the two offices were originally one large office and the owner had a wall installed in between. She kept the counters on her side so the button never got found.

I replaced all the loose ceiling tiles on both businesses, finished the last station I was under when we got ""raided"", finished up all the work left in the network closet, and called it a day. It was interesting explaining why it took so long to do the call to my boss, I was branded the ""office criminal"" for about three weeks...

*yay! -.-*

"Karen and the ""lost"" iPad","This story is about a call I just encountered while working phone support. I know what you must all be thinking, I must get these types of calls a lot, however, it is very rare to get these types of calls at my work. I work as internal IT support for $BigCompany. However, I am not employed by $BigCompany, instead I am employed by $TechCompany and work as a contractor for $BigCompany. (This is semi relevant to the story.)

Now, on to the story, to preface, $Karen, is our main subject. The type of person you hope never calls your support line as long as you shall live. She does not work for $BigCompany. She does not work for $TechCompany, either. And then there's $Me who is yours truly.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a nice calm Wednesday. For the most part, it's been calm, I've been watching YouTube and waiting for calls most of the morning, nothing has broken, so it's pretty empty in the ticket queues as well as on phones. While I was enjoying my video, I receive a call.

&amp;#x200B;

$Me: Hi, thank you for calling the $BigCompany service desk, how can I help you?

$Karen: Hi, my husband and I are scavengers and find things that we can fix up and sell. I found an iPad on the side of the road. It looks like it's brand new and hasn't been set up. It looks like it's managed by $BigCompany. Can you remove the software that manages this device?

$Me: Unfortunately, this is not something that I can do as that software is installed specifically to keep our information safe, and therefore, we are unable to remove this software.

$Karen: But I need to get into the iPad.

$Me: Do you work for $BigCompany?

$Karen: No...

$Me: Then I can not help you. This number is for $BigCompany employees only.

$Karen: But I need to get into this iPad! (a little bit angrier this time.)

$Me: Okay, and how did you find the iPad?

$Karen: Someone threw it away, along with their backpack and laptop and some other items that have the $BigCompany name on it, as well as the person's name that this belongs to.

At this point, I was a little confused because who ""throws away"" their backpack with their work belongings in it? I'm currently thinking that this was stolen by $Karen, so I try to get the name of who this belongs to.

$Me: Okay, can I get the person's name so that I can reach out to them and confirm what has happened?

$Karen: No.

$Me: Excuse me?

$Karen: No I can not give you their name, I just need to get into this iPad.

$Me: I'm sorry, but I can not do that. It sounds like this device was lost or stolen. I need to get the name of the person that appears on those items.

$Karen: I told you, it was thrown away, they don't need it anymore. Just remove the software already! Your story is bullshit. Someone threw this away. You need to be responsible. Somebody threw away a perfectly good iPad. What are you going to do to make this right?

$Me: Nothing? Like I said, I am unable to do anything here. I'm sorry. Even if someone did throw this away, we have well over 10,000 employees. I can't be responsible for each and every individual that works for $BigCompany.

Now, I'm interested because I know that I have a Karen calling in. Finally, after 2 years of working here, I get to hear how crazy people actually are.

$Karen: That's bullshit. You need to take responsibility. This is a perfectly good computer! Throwing it away is hurting the environment! $BigCompany needs to be responsible for this! To make this right, you're going to get me into this iPad so that I can keep it and use it for myself!

$Me: That still isn't happening.

$Karen: Listen here you little shit! This is not okay, you are responsible for this! You need to make this right! Your employee threw it away!

$Me: Ma'am, I don't even work for $BigCompany

$Karen: Yes you do! You said that this is the $BigCompany service desk

$Me: That is correct ma'am, however, I don't even work for %BigCompany. I work for $TechCompany. $BigCompany just contracts out $TechCompany to do their IT for them.

$Karen: You're lying! You just made that bullshit story up just to not give me the information! Give me the information now or else I'll be talking to your manager! $BigCompany is going to go down when they see how poorly they care for the environment!

$Me: Whatever lady, you're being incredibly rude and I don't need to be talked to this way. Have a nice day. \*click\*

Yes. I did actually hang up on her immediately after, and all I heard from there was screaming. I reported this to our security team, and Karen did call back a few times. I had informed my teammates what had happened, and one of them even told me she called back in telling him what I did at the end of the call, and telling him that she wasn't working for $BigCompany, but she needed to talk to my manager. Luckily, he saw what had happened, and just hung up on her. Another coworker got her again, this time he heard angrily say something along the lines of ""What the hell is going on with this support number?!"" He immediately hung up as he saw caller ID and my message explaining the whole thing.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Karen likely stole an iPad and then called internal tech support for the company it belonged to asking to get in. I tell her no. She begins to yell and scream at me, calling my ""stories"" bullshit and I end up hanging up on her.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Not too big of an update, but I did hear back the end result of this issue. She was contacted by our security team, they were able to arrange a pickup with her. She was noted to be nasty and vile in the security report as well. We ended up getting the assets but she wanted some sort of reward for her doings.

We've transitioned to purely laptops for users at our site, seemed like overkill when we started last year, but been a life saver for our staff since Covid, and now we have 3/4 staff working from home. We've sorted out our bandwidth issues and allowed users to use video during teams, they like it.

We brought in a new hire as we do sometimes, and i reimage the computer from her predecessor, install a bunch of specialized software for their position and hand it off. First hour of training i get a call, webcam is not working. \*smacks head\* I forgot to check if the camera is working, failure rate is high enough i should have checked.  

No worries, i get them a temp laptop so they can get through new hire training with a webcam, and start a ticket with Lenovo. Since it took so long to install on their software, i decide they can keep the busted computer and bring it for repair when we get the parts, instead of spending another 4 hours installing software on a second computer. They already need to come back in to get a headset anyway.

It look longer than expected but lenovo came back to me for contact information and confirm my diagnosis.  Is it in device manager, yes, i'm not an idiot. Did you try reinstalling the OS, yes, we started with a fresh install and ran all driver/bios updates. Are any privacy settings enabled, we don't pre-enable any privacy settings that would impact camera app or teams. Is the shutter turned off? Shutter, what shutter, there's not shutter, I say to myself. Erring on the side of caution i pull up the manual and learn there is indeed a shutter. I happen to have the same model so i look at it, and for the first time since i've had this computer i notice a shutter slide.

I reached out to the user, explained where to find the slide and ask if its enabled, they said it was, they slid it open, tested teams, and their camera works fine. 

Moral? Never too experience to make a mistake, never skip the simple shit.",211,0,1,"Never to experienced to make mistakes... This happened to me today.. 

My background.. I've worked tech support for the last 25 years, most of it in some senior role, I've trained people, been working helpdesk specific for the last 3 years after leaving the call center gigs.

Time for another story.

This is a recent one and I have retold it to alot of people.

So our company hosts alot from other companies and provide hardware/software/rdp/Citrix/office support and people mainly mail in their issues and orders to our ticket system.

I was bored and had a look over our order que and noticed one that seemed easy.

""My Citrix is really slow!""

Sure I figured I'll have a look soni went in to the profile on the host and clicked around checking folder sizes and whatnot.

Oh  600 MB space is what the customer has in the first 4 folders he has taken up space of around 2 Gigs.

I hook up my headset and call him up.

Me$: Hi this is $Merentis from $Techco I have had a look and I noticed you have alot of things stired in your documents pictures folder aswell as theese folders. 

$Client: okay? Fix it.

$Me: pardon?

$client: fix it remove what I dont need and fix it. *click*

I put my headset back down and ponder before grinning like a madman. 


Most of the time we dont dont do this since it'll take time and we wont be able to help out on other things and well you know what some people have on what they think is a private storage biy I had a plan to be an ass.



So I take a few moments prep a folder on the shared network drive and move everything there as a backup no real danger to fill anything up there.

And sit back sipping coffee doe a while before hitting the delete button.

As soon as I did I threw out a message on Teams to my team ""If $client from $Corp calls transfer him to me.""

It takes a short while and I get to work on a mother ticket closing down a few accounts before I get the number of someone flashing a callback to me.

$me ""welcome to $Itcompany this is $Merentis how maybe help?""

$client ""Where is my documents?! I had a bill for $largercorp""

$Me : well sir it's on the shared network drive and only with you able to access it. I removed it from your Citrix session so you wouldn't have issues with long login times.""

$client "" Why cant you just remove the things i dont need?!""

Me$ ""because if I did sir I would have to look at every file in all your folders and make a judgement myself. I know some folders are okay buuuuut the vacation photos 2008 is one I'd remove since it's not work related and I'm sure you have a better chance to see what you need and not.""

$client is silent for a short while ""thank you."" *hangs up.


I close the ticket and go about my day now we have a ticket grading system 1-10 on satisfaction rate from clients with the ability to comment.

I get a notification of him putting one 10/10 comment ""He helped me get alot of old family pictures I had forgotten about back.""

Feels good to be an ass at times.

I'd rather sleep under my car and face the bears.,"Sometimes, against our better judgement, we accept money from a customer and quickly regret it. Part of having a successful business is knowing when to say no, but sometimes we fail at that.

Things went well with the initial install and training, at least it seemed that way. The trainer said the owner was a little odd and that the general manager quit 2 days into the training, though she didn't know why. But overall she said the owner and other employees seemed to do well in training and things were running smoothly considering they had to find a new GM and several of the employees were also hired that week and not only had to learn new software, they had to learn everything else needed to operate a hotel. Things only got worse.

Within about a month all of the employees that had been trained had quit and the owner requested another few days of on site training with his new employees and the new General Manager he'd hired. During a night time training session they hear a ruckus down a hall and hear a woman yelling for someone to leave them alone. They see the owner, drunk, stumbling down the hall into the lobby and he leaves. An employee tells our trainer that the owner sometimes hits on women in the bar and gets turned down a lot.

A couple months go by nearly every week the owner calls with some sort of crisis that only the software can solve for him. We learn that everyone who had been trained, including the new GM, has quit, so the owner is on his own again and he is crumbling under the pressure. His calls to us get more and more angry to the point that a couple times we have to tell him to take a couple hours to calm down before calling again. We'll let a customer vent but we don't let them personally insult our staff.

We don't hear from him for a couple weeks and then we get a certified letter in the mail from his lawyer. This letter outlines all the ways our software has harmed his business, run off his customers, and cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost revenue. Before he takes this to court he wants to give us the chance to refund the money he's paid us and reimburse him for lost revenue. One of the admin staff hears it being discussed and asks who the customer is. She Google's them and this is where the fun begins.

The hotel has a website but the images are from the 1980's and look like they were scanned from old magazine ads. We're talking station wagons with wood trim, wood paneling in the rooms, etc. The trainer that had gone out there twice said that the hotel looks nothing like that now. Another thing that turned up in Google was reviews. 

Oh, those reviews . . . We read page after page of reviews from 2 major sites and they were a comedy of failure. The one that sticks out the most, and is still a running joke in the office several years later, went something like this, ""I'd rather sleep under my car and face the bears than sleep one more night in this place."" There were a couple themes to these reviews. The first is that the hotel was filthy and never seemed to get cleaned. I'm not sure how many rooms had wet smelly carpet stains but there were at least 10 reviews complaining about it. Of course there were complaints that the hotel pictured on the website, while clean, didn't resemble the current state of the hotel. And finally, the other common theme, the aggressive drunk man that always seemed to be at the front desk or the bar. There were many complaints about him making unwanted advances, following women to their rooms, getting in to loud arguments with people, etc. 

We didn't even bother to consult with our lawyers. We printed out about 25 pages of reviews, in color, and carefully highlighted the fun bits. We sent a copy of the letter they sent us, along with these reviews, by the fastest delivery service available and never heard back from the lawyer or the customer.",1754,0,1,"I'd rather sleep under my car and face the bears.

It was DNS!,"I literally just had this one happen. Never thought I'd actually see it, but here we are.

A customer came in complaining he couldn't connect to the corporate VPN at home. Typically when initiating the connection from the software, the user gets prompted for the credentials. This individual was not getting that prompt.

I take a look and first notice the laptop is not connected to any internet connection. I get it connected to the corporate wifi, attempt the VPN connection, and get the prompt. But something tells me to try another way...make sure. So I then connect the laptop to one of our hotspots that we use to test connectivity to the outside world only. Once that's connected, then I try to connect to the VPN. This time I do not receive the prompt for credentials.

I look at the VPN connection details while it's attempting and it just says ""Host Not Found."" I open up a web browser and try hitting the URL that we can use for the VPN. The page times out. I try hitting that URL from my phone while it's on mobile data and it gets there.

Back on the laptop, I go check the IP configuration. And there it is...he's got the addresses of the company's DNS servers hard-coded in there. I set the option back to ""Automatically Obtain"" for DNS and voila, he now gets prompted for the VPN credentials when trying to connect.

TL;DR - It was DNS.

UPDATE: The guy came back in today with the exact same problem. I checked the DNS settings and lo and behold, the DNS server addresses were populated again. This was a true WTF moment. I did  a little more troubleshooting and did a few reboots to try to replicate the behavior and determine how the addresses were getting set in the configuration.

I noticed he had the Cisco software installed for his IP phone that his group uses. I know this to be a problem for other things that are unrelated to the DNS issue. Things like when disconnecting from the VPN, it won't reconnect without rebooting the PC. But this software also doesn't allow for the reboot or shutdown...Windows will just go to the ""Restarting"" or ""Shutting Down"" screen and sit there indefinitely until a hard shutdown is enforced. I uninstalled the driver associated with the Cisco software that causes that behavior, rebooted, and tried again. On this and subsequent attempts, the DNS servers were no longer getting populated. That setting was staying set to ""Automatically obtain"" and was then allowing the VPN prompt to appear.",1279,0,1,"It was DNS! I literally just had this one happen.

That setting was staying set to ""Automatically obtain"" and was then allowing the VPN prompt to appear."
The tale of Norman,"Norman. My sweet sweet Norman. I work at a small IT company focussing mainly on small business and home users. Generally speaking, most of my clients are competent enough to help me figure out their issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's Norman. Norman is a man in his 70's, a retired University professor who I'm sure was a brilliant man in his day. Though these days...not so much.

&amp;#x200B;

A few days ago Norman calls me up with a few small computer issues. His typical issue is struggling to get into his email, or needing help reseting passwords. I've installed a permanent remote support software on his computer so I'm readily accessible when he inevitably calls. He tells me he's having trouble logging into his email, so I remote in with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, being a retired professor, he still has access to his University email. This university in particular uses Duo two factor authentication for login. So anytime he logs into his email, his cell phone gets a push notification which he has to allow the login. The last piece of info that's relevant is that Norm has an iPhone 7 Plus.

&amp;#x200B;

Norm and I are on his computer, and get to the point where a push notification is sent. The following conversation ensues.

Norm: How am I going to be able to do this now, while we are on the phone?

Me: It's pretty simple. First thing, just put me on speakerphone. Am I on speaker?

Norm: Yes, I've got you on speaker

Me: Alright, go ahead and hit your home button for me then.

Norm:....Could you remind me which one is the home button?

Me: Sure, the button all the way at the bottom center of your phone.

Norm: Oh, you mean the big red button with a phone on it!

Me: No no Norm! That one will hang up. The home button is right below that.

Norm: There are no buttons below the red button

Me: Did you get a new phone?

Norm: No

Me: Then there is a physical button at the bottom of the phone, not on the screen. Push that.

Norm: Oh you must mean this red button with the phone symbol on it.

Me:...Nope not that one. I tell you what, why don't you call me from your home phone to make this easier

Norm: That sounds great I'll call right back from my home phone.

At this point, I'm a bit frustrated because this is taking a much longer time that it should, though I'm a patient guy especially with a guy like Norm. In a few minutes, Norm calls back from the same phone number. It goes as follows.

Me: Hey Norm did you call me from your house phone?

Norm: Yeah I called you from my house phone.

Me: Alright, I was just confused because it came up as the same number as your cell phone

Norm: Thats because I'm on my cell phone

Me:...

Norm: Did I do something wrong?

Me: No, not something wrong. But why don't you go grab your house phone now and give me a call. 

Norm: Okay Ill go grab it!

Norm goes to get his home  and returns. 

Norm: Alright I'll call you now.

He dials a number, and his OWN phone starts ringing. He tries to pick up, but as he just called himself, no one is there and he's not sure what happened.

You don't know your passwords and you don't know how to look for a notification on your phone. I can't help you.,"I had a call once from a client with login issues. User was trying to reset their password and a quirk of our login system is that it doesn't work reliably on mobile web browsers and our app doesn't have the ability to change passwords.  And the official policy is we don't support mobile browsers.  It's stupid and I hate it, but that's the way it is. Anyway, the user needs to open the email link on a desktop browser to reset their password. But the user only has email on their phone, not their computer. So we go to login to Gmail on the computer. Surprise, the user doesn't know their password. So, even though it's outside of my scope of support, I try to help and guide them through the reset password options on Google. The only reset option the user has set up is a phone notification. Google says they sent it to the phone, but user swears up and down they don't see anything. Well that's the end of what I'm physically able to do. I'm polite over the phone, but in my head I am screaming.

Server! Application! Network! Server! App! Network!,"This is a story about an issue two months in troubleshooting, but longer in making.

Some quick background - I work as a Network Engineer for a company that manufactures and sells audio/visual equipment.  We have multiple offices around the world, but this story involves only two - our Corporate Headquarters (HQ) and our primary manufacturing plant (MP), which are roughly two miles apart from each other.  

At the MP our line workers use handheld scanning PDAs to update and track inventory from a server located at HQ.  These PDAs use a specialized wireless network with strict policy to allow them to communicate to only this inventory server.  Originally there was a dedicated fiber link between HQ and MP, but at the beginning of this year we switched all our offices to a SD-WAN solution and the fiber link was taken down.  This setup has worked great for about six months, and another 10 years prior on the dedicated fiber path.

In the third week of August the line workers started complaining about 'lag' on a subset of the PDAs.  They complained that it would take roughly 30 seconds for a scan to pull the information from the server, when previously is was near instantaneous.  After some digging, we found that so long as the PDA kept being used then scans would be perfect, but after sitting idle for a few minutes the lag would reintroduce for the next scan.  

Even more frustrating was that only some of the PDAs were impacted.  We use two kinds - Zebra and Android.  The Android PDAs worked flawlessly, and the lag was only noticed on the Zebra scanners.

We opened a case with the vendor of the server, thus starting the blame game.

The server team blamed the network.  

The network team blamed the application.

The application team blamed the server.

And round and round we went for two months.

At multiple points during the troubleshooting we ran packet captures to watch the traffic.  I found that the traffic from the Zebra PDAs were traversing the network and talking to the server on port 7654.  The server responds normally.  After two minutes of inactivity, the server sends a ""Session close"" request to the PDA, which is never receives acknowledgment of.  If a user tries another scan after that time, the PDA reuses the same source port but the server neglects to respond, as it has already shut that connection down.  After 30 seconds the PDA gives up and retries from a new source port, which then works.  We also found that the Android PDAs exhibited the same traffic behaviour, but on port 80 and with no lack of response to the session close request.

So now that we knew the source of the lag, but not its cause, we had sufficient ammunition to take to the application administrators and ask what they changed to break only the Zebra PDAs.

Application team said 'nothing' and blamed the server team.

Server team said ""Yes, we patched the server a few days prior to the first report, but it's not that and must be the network.""

Network team said ""If it was the network then other applications would be impacted, not just this one type of scanner, so must be the application.""

And again we start the blame game for another month.

Eventually, in mid October, my boss is upset and frustrated.  ""I don't care what the cause is, I just want it fixed!  We've lost 190 man hours to this issue already!""

We schedule a call between all three teams with executives present in an effort to finalize a plan to fix the problem.  During this call it is decided that we will clone the server with the previous updates prior to the issue.  We will watch all traffic again and see if the issue repeats.  If it does, then we definitively know it's not the server, and in that case we will take the \~$5K hit to migrate the server to MP.

We clone the VM, run the tests.  Lag is still present.

My boss is upset, since this amounts to a huge financial hit during a time when we are trying to save money.

I decide to pore through the packet captures taken.  I quickly stumble over something that all of the previous packet captures did not have:

\-----

14	210.692358	{SERVER}  {ZEBRA PDA}	TCP	54	\[TCP ACKed unseen segment\] \[TCP Previous segment not captured\] 7654 → 1150 \[FIN, ACK\] Seq=18815 Ack=16384 Win=64314 Len=0

15	210.770979	{RANDOM L3 SWITCH}   {SERVER}	ICMP	82	Time-to-live exceeded (Time to live exceeded in transit)

\-----

Wait - Why is a random Layer 3 switch in our old core telling the server that traffic it sent timed out?  Traffic should not be going in that direction, not since we took down that fiber link...

The thing is, that fiber link is still technically in place, just in a disabled state and it lives in the old core.  We merely disabled the ports and the routes in case we needed to quickly roll back to it.  We never had to roll back though, and with COVID pandemic we sort of forgot to clean it all up.

In the second week of August I did a major firmware update of our HQ firewall.  This firmware update re-enabled a single specific route that was in place for the dedicated wireless network of the PDA scanners, designed to route that traffic not through our SD-WAN but through the fiber link in our old core.  

So I delete the route and magically the lag goes away.  The Zebra PDAs now actually see and respond to the session close requests like they should.

What is baffling to me, and why I think this makes a good story, is how a static route for a /24 network will break ONLY a specific subset of devices in that network, and ONLY a specific type of traffic for those devices.

To the remedial class!,"I had to visit the accountants office today.

Remember when Homer Simpson went to work for Hank Scorpio? Remember the remedial class Bart was put in to? It's like going in there.

I name them Tina and Ralph, Tina Belcher from Bob's burgers becasue whenever you ask her anything over the phone you get 20 seconds of ""errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"". ""can you click on start"" ""errrrrrrrrrrrrr"", ""is the monitor on?"" ""errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"", ""are the lights on in your office?"" ""errrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"", and Ralph for Ralph Wiggum.

The switch had been looped and dropped them off from the rest of the network. I theorise it's another attack of Consuela the OCD cleaner plugging lose network cables into sockets, I fix that. internet connectivity returns, IP phones spring back to life, network volumes reappear.

Ralph needs to test sage as that wasn't working.

Sage is Ralph's acid test for everything, internet can't be down because sage works, building can't be on fire becasue sage works. The internet must be broken because sage doesn't work.

Today everything must be broken becasue sage wouldn't open. Despite being told that the issue causing sage not to work was clear  and the sage network volume was now connected Ralph needed to see with own little pudgy eyes. The fact that it opened where previously there was an error was not enough, no he needs to go in and start processing a load of accounts data. 15 minutes in after doing this weeks expenses he declares everything fine.

But wait, i know a common issue in here, the network printer, ""can we test printing"" i say.  The gods know the game they are playing with me, it's not about the result, it never was, it's about the dance.. it's schroedingers printer. If it test it will work. If i leave without testing the printing it will fail, and i will have to suffer a call from one of these two, and you all know the type of call, the one where the caller wants to spend more time talking about the fact there is a problem than actually doing anything resembling working towards fixing the problem. Oh how i dream about interrupting people and saying ""You have spent 10 minutes talking about something that takes 10 seconds to fix, your have two ears and one mouth, how about using them in that ratio and you let me actually do my job?"" but i've been in this game too long to make that mistake, that's just a flaming ball of HR funtime waiting to happen, instead you suck it up and let them prattle on while being polite.

Tina errrrrrrrrs at me. For me a test print is open up notepad, type hi, click print, 10 seconds on a slow day. But Tina is doing it. ERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. click on start, now which program, word or excel, she hovers the mouse between the two icons for 30 damn seconds. My Inner mononlogue is screaming ""Just F\*cking click one"", She opens word, but no, rather than just type test and hit print, she now has to choose a previous document, she sits there, motionless, for 30 seconds out of the minute of deciding i am unable to see her as like Drax the destroyer, she too has mastered the ability to be so incredibly still that she became invisible to the eye. Finally she opens the file, my heart drops, its 12 pages, she's going to read them all isnt she? Of course she is.

When two old folks come into a wireless retail store...,"You already know its gonna be hell. 

I work at a wireless retail store. 

Yesterday I had this woman in her 60's come in, with her husband who had lost his phone. They didn't want to do an insurance claim and just wanted to upgrade. I told them even if they'd got a new phone, there was no way for us to transfer the data from the old phone to the new phone since they didn't have the old one on them. Immediately they started throwing questiins at me, specifically if I was ""in training."" 

I have only been there four months, and don't have tons of experience, so I am still getting used to the sales part, but I know how to do the job and understand the basics of our systems. I responded and told her no. 

From start to finish she questioned everything I did and said, bothering my coworker every few minutes even though he was clearly busy helping some other customers because ""he knew how to do it."" At the beginning, she told me she didn't know much about phones. And then as we went on, she started telling me I didn't know what I was doing, that I had to do such and such first, and made negative comments about literally everything. 

She made it clear she was worried about her husband not being able to keep his number. I told her not to worry, and that it wouldn't be a problem. I went and got out the new sim card, and began to update it but our system was moving slow, it was just taking forever to load. 

While waiting for it to kick up, her husband asked me what he would need to do in order to make his old device inaccessible incase it was stolen. I explained he'd have to call customer care, explain it to them, and request they block the IMEI. Device blocking isn't something we can do on our end, per company policy. Immediately his wife chimed in, ""Yes you can! They did it for us last time!"", she turned to my coworker, and immediately lost her shit, ""Sir! Sir! Can you come over here and help her since you know what you're doing? Last time we were able to transfer the number and didn't have to call any numbers!"" 

Like, we weren't even talking about that? He explained exactly what I said to her, and she continued to pester him. 

The rest of the process went rather smoothly, but i could hear them complaining under their breath about everything. When they came in, they specifically asked for the IPhone 11. They kept making comments about how ""small"" the phone was, and how it always took 2 hours when they came to a store. I mean, Idk, don't come in then? Maybe buy a more expensive, and bigger phone next time? 

Its always a pain in the ass working with older people like this. Especially when they're never satisfied with anything.",1364,0,1,"When two old folks come into a wireless retail store... You already know its gonna be hell.

While waiting for it to kick up, her husband asked me what he would need to do in order to make his old device inaccessible incase it was stolen. I explained he'd have to call customer care, explain it to them, and request they block the IMEI. Device blocking isn't something we can do on our end, per company policy. Immediately his wife chimed in, ""Yes you can! They did it for us last time!"", she turned to my coworker, and immediately lost her shit, ""Sir! Sir! Can you come over here and help her since you know what you're doing? Last time we were able to transfer the number and didn't have to call any numbers!"" 

Like, we weren't even talking about that? He explained exactly what I said to her, and she continued to pester him. 

The rest of the process went rather smoothly, but i could hear them complaining under their breath about everything. When they came in, they specifically asked for the IPhone 11. They kept making comments about how ""small"" the phone was, and how it always took 2 hours when they came to a store. I mean, Idk, don't come in then? Maybe buy a more expensive, and bigger phone next time? 

Its always a pain in the ass working with older people like this. Especially when they're never satisfied with anything."
We're getting a message saying we're out of licenses.,"We had a customer once, actually we still have them, that tried to be sneaky and steal our software. The owner of the restaurant had, unbeknownst to us, 2 other restaurants in the same town. A couple years prior to this we got a call that their server crashed and they needed to reinstall the software and activate the license. This happens all the time so we think nothing of it. The next week we get another call saying the new server was having problems and they needed to reinstall again and needed another license activation. It happens sometimes and we have no reason to question them.

That's until a couple years later when we get a call from a new restaurant manager needing some help adding items to the menu. We don't recognize the restaurant name so we ask him for the license number so we can get a support ticket started. It comes up as another restaurant and when we ask the manager to clarify he tells us that's another one of their locations. The manager gets the help he needs but one of our sales managers contacts the owner about this and the owner blows it off and says the manager was confused and gave us the wrong name. We're getting suspicious and make a note in their account.

A few months go by and we get a call from a local IT professional who's installing some new workstations. When he tries to launch the app he's informed that the maximum number of licenses is already in use. We tell him we'll contact the owner to get some more licenses purchased and just have log off a couple other workstations to test. This is when someone finally, however unknowingly, spills the beans. He tells us that since they have a corporate license, can't he just reduce the licenses at another one of the restaurants that don't need them.

Hmm . . . Please tell us more. This IT guy tells us how they're running our software at 3 restaurants and that the owner tells him they have a corporate license and can install it as many times as they want. We don't have anything called a corporate license and we explain this to the IT guy who is sort of shocked by this and a little offended that the owner would have him help in stealing software. He then tells us that he helped with the 2 other installs and though it was odd that they didn't want him to call to activate the licenses. It looks like the owner was trying to fool him too. At the end of the call the IT guy gives us the names and addresses of the other restaurants as well as the number of users he thinks they have at each location.

We have a sales manager that lives for situations like this and he makes the call. The owner doesn't deny anything, though. The sales manager feels deflated because he was hoping for an epic argument, but he make a decent sale and add 2 more restaurants to their support contract, so that makes him feel better. It's like a spouse that cheats but comes clean when you confront them. They promise never to do it again, and they don't, but you still keep an eye out for anything suspicious.",2136,0,1,"We're getting a message saying we're out of licenses.

"Rude client with no SLA wants me to drop everything for them, calls me 'Rude' when he realizes that I follow my companies procedures.","Also on r/AITA

The company I work for specialises in installing and maintenance of Bio-metric and physical access (fingerprint readers, doors, etc) for all types of companies but we are mainly focused on Data Centres &lt;DC's &gt;(essentially big places that other companies rent space to host their servers), and a technician from a branch of a DC company emailed me on Tuesday afternoon saying that their 'visitor enrollment' system is down.

So I replied asking for Teamviewer details, passwords, etc, cc'ing our accounts people top prepare the quote. That was at 1pm. I left my office at 5PM with no response. At 6, the tech who logged the initial call called our emergency support number that is given to clients who have a SLA with us, conversation is as follows:

Me- Good evening this is me how can I help you?

P1- Why haven't you connected yet?

Me- I'm sorry who is speaking here?

P1- This is 'P1' from 'branch'.

Me- Okay I remember. I haven't connected because you haven't sent me any details.

P1- I haven't sent them because I thought you would have them.

Me- Well I don't have them (and never have stored them) as your company does not have a SLA (service level agreement) with us at all.

P1- I want it fixed NOW!

Me- We can only help you as soon as a 'slot' opens up.

P1- I'll pay once I get the invoice! When are you connecting and when will I get the invoice?

Me- 10AM tmw as I have meetings at SLA clients. Normally I'm done with them by 10AM and you will get the invoice at the same time as we send the Job card.

P1- Not good enough. I want immediate support.

Me- Well if I'm finished before 10, then I'll connect then, if I have the details.

P1- You'll get them.

Wednesday comes. No email from the client until 11AM where it includes all the details which took 2 hours to finish. Then I send the job card + invoice to P1 + P1 boss. I received the signed job card as I got into the office yesterday.

Today I get a phone call from 'P1' asking me why I sent him invoices when he wanted 'quotes'. I told him that ""this was a P1 support call + he also requested it when I send the job cards, + I have voice recordings backing me up on that.

P1- You're so rude!

Me- You're calling me rude, when you don't respond to my emails with the requested info to sort out your issue, use the emergency support number after hours demanding immediate service when you don't have a SLA with us and expect us to serve you at your convenience without paying us for that privilege, you call me rude. Luckily we record all of our conversations. I'll be sending your boss a email. We'll see who is rude.

I relayed everything to my boss who without a moment's hesitation said 'From now on no support to that company until the invoice is paid. They can go to (cheap competitor) for all we care. Email the complaint &lt;P1 boss&gt;, &lt;P1 CEO&gt; and cc myself. Include everything in it.'

Why did you sell us these flimsy touch screen monitors? Send us replacements.,"In the early days of online sales mostly dialup at this point, my company partnered with a distributor and we quickly became one of the largest online drop shipping companies of P.O.S. hardware in the US. This was short lived because our success was quickly noticed by other companies as well as the distributor and the business model was repeated so often that within a couple years it became difficult to make a profit that was worth the headache. I have lots of stories from this time and here's one.

An off the strip Vegas casino had ordered maybe 20 touch screen monitors from us. These were the Elo CRT monitors, not the now common LCD monitors we have today. After a few weeks we get a call that they want to return some of them because they're defective and their fingers have punched holes in them. They say the monitors are so cheap that their fingers just punch into the screen with normal use. Say what?

We contact the distributor to figure out what to do and the distributor is just as confused as we are. They provide the customer with return shipping labels and maybe a week later the distributor calls us. They say that it looks like the monitors have had things thrown at them or hit with hammers and that they won't be covering the replacements under warranty. We call the customer and explain what the distributor told us and they act like it's no big deal and order replacements. We still don't know what happened to them but maybe it was a bar fight or a disgruntled employee smashing things.

TLDR at the end

Obligatory „not a techsupport“, because i do not work in the IT-Department of my company.  
The reason I still will write this, is because I am something of an unofficial techsupport in my own department. I got this tasks because first I am a gamer and techsavy enough to do it and second because if you want some simple things done by our IT-Department it will take months. til they help you.

So yeah, I am responsible for things like assembling workstations for new workers or first level support when a program does not want to flow someone demands. Additionally I am tasked with the administration of our process management tool (which guarantees enough stories to post here).

Upfront my first language is not English so if my grammar is not correct or your find some mistake then, dear redditors, take them,print them and put them in a nice frame and on your walls.

Now to the story:  
Last year we moved from an old officebuilding to a new one. This meant that I was tasked with getting all workstations into boxes and then running again at our new office. I did not have the resources and also not the material to get all cables nice and tidy (we only had few cable ties and I had to work with duct tape) but I got the into one of those cable ducts that are mounted to the working table. 

This was ok until these events went down two weeks ago:

You see this construction of mine was okish but not very stable. This meant if someone tinker with this, there was a good chance that it will fall down and make a huge mess of the cables in it.

Enter Coworker (CW1) number one. I do not know how this went down but somehow she knocked everything down. She told me that this happened and asked me if I could fix it fast. Now the problem was I had no free timeslots and I was not motivated to spend some overtime to reassemble my construction on this day.

Therefore, I told her that I will look for an opportunity to fix it as soon as possible but it can take a week or so. The problem was that my construction included the cables of 2 workstation so there was also a second Coworker I will from now on call Sarah.  
 Sarah was and still is a typical entitled person that has no idea how to fix things, especially when it comes to IT, but gets salty when you do not make her problem your number one priority.

The following conversation ensued:

Sarah: These cables look horrible and they are in my way (Note: No they were not. She could only reach them if she really tried). Fix them fast

Me: I do not have time for this right now. I told CW1 that I will fix it as soon as possible, maybe ‘til next week

Sarah: No this is unacceptable. Fix it right now or I will not be able to work

Me (a bit annoyed): You are able to work! This will not stop you from working. You can hardly touch them

Sarah: You have no idea how hard it is to work with this at my feet. Now just do it!

Me (not in a mood for a long argument): Look if you want it fixed now please just do it yourself. If have some material right here \[points at my personal material box\].

I have to say this was the sentence I would regret afterwards. But for the time being, there was no more discussion about fixing it.  
When I got to work the next day, everything seemed normal. This was until Sarah come to work and bolted right to our Head of Department (let’s call him Steve).  
 She came out with him and the screaming started:

Sarah: Why the hell did you say to me I should fix it. Now my computer does not work anymore

Me: Wha … What did I do? (I had no idea what she is talking about)

Sarah: You destroyed my computer you damn Idiot 

Me: What … I did not … I did not even touch your PC

Sarah: Yeah you did. You told me to fix it and I fixed it

Steve: Can you please fix her PC so it will work again?

Not knowing what she did I went to her Workstation to look what she did.  
 Then I saw the horror of everyone who likes to work on PCs. You see next to my material is a little tool box with some standard tool (Pliers, screwdrivers etc.)

What she did was she took the pliers that have that thing you can cut cables with (don’t know how this is called). And she cut every cable that were “in her way), so frankly all of them.

Me: What. the. Hell. Did. You. Do?

Sarah: I did what you told me and I fixed it. Just the way you said me?

Steve: Fix her PC so that it is running again

Me: How should i? Why did you do that?

Sarah: This solved the problem … now I will not be held back by the cables

Steve comes over and looks at the crime scene

Steve: What the f-? Did you tell her to do this?

Me: Hell no. I did not tell her to go full-rambo on these cables.

Sarah: It is solved now, just fix the computer you lazy idiot. I need to work

Me: How should I do that? You just massacred 8 Cables that your PCS need to run.

Sarah: \[Confused look\]

Me: Don’t tell me you did not know that you need the cables to.

Sarah: \[turning away and getting fire-red\]

Me: F- me sideways \[sigh\] … ok Steve I need you to order some cables so I can fix this.   
Until then I will go to IT and ask for a spare Laptops or something.

Sarah: You told me to fix it… now it is destoyed. You are incompetent and lazy

Steve: Sarah shut it! We will talk about this later! Now let him get you something so you can work.

Two days later I got everything fixed and running smooth again.  
Sarah got a stern talking from Steve and our Head of IT about not to brutalize infrastructure and had to work on one of our shitty laptops for 2 days.  
I just felt sorry for CW1 because she also had to work on a shitty laptop for 2 weeks. 

And at the end I got to tell you this tale of the cable murderer in my office.

Open circuit? This little thing opens it.,"This is barely tech support, but I'll let you judge if it's close enough. Couple years ago, a friend of mine opened up a bar. Worked like hell, scrounged around for the necessary equipment / furniture/ etc., made rather a nice place.

About a month in, he gave me a call. ""Hey, do you have a multimeter? My dishwasher has a broken wire somewhere and the tech can't find it."" So, I head over, this commercial dishwasher is stripped of all its covers, the control board is hanging from its harness,  showing all the signs of a frustrated repairman.

The thing just won't start a cycle. He's explaining that the tech couldn't find anything wrong, changed the board, didn't help, as he clears a space for me to work. Must, therefore, be a broken wire somewhere, they conclude.

I reached out and pushed as I told him, ""try it now."" Surprise, there it goes! Running perfectly! Just half an hour of reassembly to do.

The problem? The door switch was bent slightly out of place. That little switch means I still can't spend any money when I go to that bar!

Son of backup adventures,"As a follow-up to my [previous tale of woe](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/jag7cf/nobody_cares_if_the_backups_work_only_if_the/), I have discovered another . . . quirk in the tape backup system.

The new server arrived with six tapes. We've only ever had four before, but OK, they're not that cheap, so great. They get labeled with a letter, A through F.

As noted before, the backup software won't overwrite (what it thinks is) the latest tape, so it keeps track.

The problem is, it's only aware of tapes A through D, because we've never had an E or F before.

Does it throw an error of some kind when confronted with this mysterious tape? No, of course not. Does it even respond *consistently*? You're an optimist if you expect that.

What it does is take tape E or F and assume it's tape A. It doesn't relabel it - if I read the tape label, it says E or F as expected. And it doesn't cause the backup to fail, it just logs it as being successful on tape A.

Unless, of course, the most recent successful backup was on the actual tape A, or E or F (recorded as A), in which case it just quietly ignores the whole confusing situation and pretends it wasn't supposed to do a backup at all, just like it would if we forgot to change the tape.

And don't get me started on switching from alphanumeric store numbers to numeric store numbers, only not really because the store field in the database is only one character long. That's a tale for another day.",157,0,1,"Son of backup adventures As a follow-up to my [previous tale of woe](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/jag7cf/nobody_cares_if_the_backups_work_only_if_the/), I have discovered another . . . quirk in the tape backup system.

The new server arrived with six tapes. We've only ever had four before, but OK, they're not that cheap, so great. They get labeled with a letter, A through F.

As noted before, the backup software won't overwrite (what it thinks is) the latest tape, so it keeps track.

The problem is, it's only aware of tapes A through D, because we've never had an E or F before.

Does it throw an error of some kind when confronted with this mysterious tape? No, of course not. Does it even respond *consistently*? You're an optimist if you expect that.

"Your software isn't working with our new cash drawers, help. Now with 100% more electrical shock!","Our software activates cash drawers by sending a message to a printer with a cash drawer plug in it. This is either a drawer 1 or drawer 2 message and you have to make sure your cash drawer is compatible with this method of activation when you buy one. Most are, though so it's rare that a customer comes across one that won't work.

I'm working with a bar manager who ordered these cash drawers and he's pretty eager to get them working since he's the one who ordered them - without verifying that they were compatible. We go through all the troubleshooting steps, we verify that the old drawer solenoid activates (it was too weak to unlock the drawer but you could hear it click), make sure the cables aren't broken or cut, etc. At this point I'm suspecting that the wiring is wrong for his Epson printers and suggest he find an old phone cable and try splicing wires together until he finds the right combination. These cash drawers used a standard 4 wire phone cable and this was in the days of dial up modems and businesses usually had a few of these spare cables around. 

He finds a cable and then we discuss how to determine which pair of wires the signal is coming from. I tell him I'll look up some schematics but jokingly say you can always put the wires to your tongue while hitting the ""Open Drawer"" button, similar to when you test a 9 volt battery with your tongue. A few seconds later I hear a scream and then some very vulgar language. This guy actually put the wires to his tongue. This is 12 volts with a respectable amperage. He told me what he did and I laughed and told him I was joking. He just responded with a sort of embarrassed, ""Oh . . ."" But you know what?

"The kitchen is on fire, can you login and fix that?","Second post (mobile)

Background: from the US. Been doing help desk support for ~6yrs. I worked as in-house IT for ~2.5yrs, and MSP help desk for ~3.5yrs. Certified engineer for a VoIP phone system. Most of my training was self taught [trial and error, YouTube, etc], and the rest was learned on the job.

Story time:

My first IT job was in-house IT for an entertainment facility (or rather a chain of facilities). I had worked in the facility for quite some time prior to being “promoted” to IT... started as cashier and worked my way to shift manager. Huge step up, I know [sarcasm]. I had experience with how the systems worked and how to interact with customers. The facility had a bar and small restaurant, and we often hosted large events from birthdays to corporate gatherings. There were arcade games and bowling, music and laser lights, the whole nine yards. I had become very familiar with various issues that occurred throughout the facility, and being a manager, I had to make sure things ran smoothly for the guests. An issue would arise and the cliché “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” became old. After an altercation with a sh*t faced drunken Karen (involving pitchers of beer being hurled at my head and a call to law enforcement at 3am), I had enough and was ready for a career change. The head of IT caught wind of this, and hired me on the spot (IT would only hire internal employees to save time with training and familiarizing with the facilities).

As mentioned in my last post, we had an on-call rotation. 

During my first week of “IT training” (more like Pavlov’s conditioning), I was asked to shadow my coworker and assist where I can. One night (maybe my third or fourth IT shift) we received a tech call around midnight. Our office was open 9-5, and afterhours calls went to voicemail. We’d get an email with a transcription of the message. The message read “Hi IT guys, the kitchen is on fire. What do I do? Can you just like login and fix that?”

It took a few moments for my brain to process whether this was a joke or a serious issue. Being inexperienced, I messaged my coworker and waited for his response. While waiting, I went ahead and called the client. Got voicemail, and heard nothing from my coworker. Fantastic [sarcasm]. We had remote access to the security system at the client location so I taught myself how to use our software and take a look. Again, this was my first week on the job so I didn’t know much about our software yet. Literally one second after I logged in, the client called me back.

EU: “Ya IT guy, the grill in the kitchen is on fire. Can you like just turn on the sprinklers or something?”

Me: “What?! No, I’m afraid I can’t. Did you turn off the gas to the grill?! Have you called 911?!”

EU: “Umm... no...”

Me: “Turn off the gas!! Grab the fire extinguisher and put out the fire!!”

There was a pause. I watched the security camera in the kitchen and saw flames shooting out like dragon’s fire from the grill as the client stood dumbfounded.

EU: “We don’t have a fire extinguisher...”

Me: *forehead meets desk* “I am looking at the security camera. On the wall behind you is a fire extinguisher. Next to that is the red emergency cutoff lever for the gas. Turn off the gas, and extinguish the fire!”

EU: “...how do I do that?”

One on-the-fly fire fighting lesson later and they managed to extinguish the fire. As the dust settled I asked:

Me: “So why did you call IT for a kitchen fire instead of calling 911?”

EU: “Well, I tried calling the shift manager but he didn’t answer. So I called the GM, but they didn’t answer... and I knew if I called IT you guys HAD to answer.”

Can’t really argue that logic...

"""Why won't the screaming stop?!""","Another short tale from Point of Sale.

Back in the day one of my customers was the cafeteria at a local hospital. They had several cash registers that connected via a proprietary network to a back office PC where they could run reports and authorize transactions using the patients ID number.

At the end of every shift they would run reports on those long folio folded perforated ledger sheets with the green and white stripes. If you are over 50 you know exactly what I'm talking about.

These were continuous feed via a tractor mechanism to a dot matrix printer. The sheets were 8 1/2 x 14 legal size so the printer was huge.

Screaming?

Yes Screaming.

In a hospital.

It was disturbing patients apparently.

So I go out there, run a report and damned if the printer didn't start screaming like it was a peacock being murdered!

I do all my checks and am about ready to pull out my screwdrivers ( machines fear me when I get out the screwdrivers ) when I look down the paper feed path and see...

An Aspirin.

As the paper went through the tractor feed it dragged along the aspirin and vibrated it against the plastic feed guide at JUUUST the perfect frequency to sound exactly like a woman's scream.

I removed the aspirin and it was just as quiet as you remember dot matrix printers to be.

40 years of Google spying,"I work for an ISP that provides cable tv, internet, and phone service as well as email. We’ve recently changed the email client we use to host our email accounts. Today was the day it took place. Many calls came in today about customers not being able to login, missing emails in various folders, etc. One issue with the new client is that if a customer tries to access  the email account on a smart phone the customer has to use a mail client app(gmail, Apple mail, etc.) 

One particular customer called today and was upset about having to use a client app to get her emails and the conversation went something like this. 

CL = conspiracy lady Me= me. 

CL: So there is nothing that can be done if I want to get my emails on my phone? I have to use an app of some kind.

Me: Unfortunately with the new email client we’ve begun using you will not be able to access emails from the web browsers anymore on a smart phone, you will have to use a mail app client. 

CL: well I’m not happy about this. I don’t want to use any app to access my emails from my phone because I have to download it from the play store and I don’t want to do that because I have an Android. Do you know who makes android? Google. Do you know that google spies on everything we do? I’m not going to use Gmail to access my emails. 

Me: We do have a (company name) app that you can use to access the emails. You won’t have to use Gmail at all if you don’t want to. 

CL:  But I still have to download it from the GOOGLE play store, won’t I? 

Me: Yes you will have to download it from the google play store.

CL: Well I’m not going to do that. I don’t want google reading my emails, spying on everything I do. It’s my right as an American to hate google so that is what I’m going to do. I used to be able to push one button on my phone and get my emails and you’re telling me if I want to access my emails on my phone again I have to be spied on?

Me: Unfortunately with a smart phone you will have to download a mail app of some kind, with the email client we’ve moved to accessing emails from the web browser will no longer be possible. Again, you don’t have to use google’s Gmail app, you can use (company name) app, yahoo’s mail app, you just need a mail app that will need to be downloaded from the App Store. 

CL: OP I’ve been using computers for 40 years! Do you know that google has been spying on everything I do for those 40 years!? I’m tired of being spied on, I’m tired of their harassment, and I’m tired of them invading my privacy. It’s my right as an American to hate google and I’ve been fighting them for 40 years. I just want them to leave me alone. 

Me: You can still access your emails on computers through the web browser if you have a computer. I apologize for the inconvenience bu.....

CL: But with a smart phone I need an app. I get it. Well I’m not happy. I really don’t like this and I hope you put that in my file or records or whatever. You have a good rest of your day. (End of call)

All of the kitchen printers failed. Why did you sell us junk?,"We once had a local customer who was one of those types who blows up under stress. Nobody would deal with him so we decided to sell him hardware as well as software. Great food, great chef, terrible business sense. They're closed now.

We get a call on a Friday afternoon that all of their kitchen printers have failed. He's given basic troubleshooting steps over the phone and says that nothing is helping. They're all connected to workstations via LONG ASS parallel cables and all of this is secure and it's unlikely 4 cables would go bad at the same time. He tells us the lights are on and nothing seems wrong. The receipt and expediter printers are fine so the operating system and software aren't likely the problem.

They don't have a support contract with us but because the hardware is still under warranty we tell him we'll order some replacements. He's desperate and has a really busy weekend and offers free dinner and alcohol as well as agreeing to a 6 month support contract if we'll send someone out right away. Being the top guy has its advantages and I snap this amazing opportunity up.

I get there and the owner is about to have a mental breakdown. He rushes me to the kitchen and starts yelling at me to fix the junk printers we sold him (industry standard Epsons). I look at the printers and see that there are no lights.  I mention this to him and he tells me it's just one more problem he's been dealing with because several of his fancy blenders aren't working either and he won't be able to make sauces and such fast enough to keep up with demand. It take me about 15 seconds for the light in my tiny brain to come on and I ask if all of these things are on the same breaker. He stops to think for a few seconds and that frantic look on his face turns to calm and he walks to the breaker panel and flips the tripped breaker back on.

Everything is working now and he sort of apologized for being an ass. He obviously didn't check much and when he told us the lights were on, he probably didn't even look at the printers. I get it, he was stressed and about to pull his own hair out. Anyway, I sat down to an amazing meal with a grateful customer. I don't drink wine but he gave me a bottle to take to the office as well as a giant bottle of some delicious seasoned olive oil and several loaves of fresh baked bread.

When computer repair gets dangerously close to terrorism,"This was the early 2000's, and I was working for a consulting firm that had a lot of contracts with local school systems.  I did everything from server setups and networking, to replacing the mouse balls the kids were constantly removing to play with.

I have a ticket that a classroom PC was not working on the 4th grade hall.  I wait outside the door until the teacher stops talking, then stick my head in and ask if I can fix the PC real quick.  It is on the other side of the room by the windows and out of the way, so I go over and quietly try to diagnose the problem.  I start running through the usual suspects and find the problem pretty quick.  The door off of a 3.5"" floppy has come off and jammed in the drive.  Back in the old days this was a fairly common issue, especially in computers that had a lot of traffic from different users all day.

The problem is that the kids would usually try to fix it themselves, and end up bending the door so that it was opened up even wider, which made it a pain to get out.  Luckily I had the perfect tool for this, a 5"" lockblade knife that would let you get up under the bent part, then slide back to hold the door closed while you fished the whole thing out.  Worked like a charm most of the time and was really quick.  You have probably already figured out the problem here, and I stress that I had *never* thought about this.  I didn't work in the school rooms much.  I was a server guy and my time was usually more useful somewhere else, so this was kind of a side-deal when they didn't have anything more important for me to do.  So I reach into my bag, pull out the knife, pop it open in one motion while heading for the floppy drive.

Behind me I hear an audible *gasp*.  I turn around and the whole room is staring at me.  It slowly dawns on me that I just pulled a pretty mean looking knife on 20ish 10-year-olds.  I apologized to the teacher and explained that this really was the best tool for fixing this particular problem, but that I probably should use the 2nd best tool from now on.  Lucky for me, this was a really rural school, so the teacher just laughed and let it go.  I didn't even get sent to principals office!

I can't help but think that with all the tension we seem to have these days, that a similar mistake might not get laughed off any more."
Excel expert required for map project,"I was job hunting. A local temp agency had this listed, so I applied. They called me that afternoon, and you could smell the desperation through the phone. Apparently I was the only Excel expert who had replied at all.

I interviewed the next day. Let the parade of facepalms begin!

The large company needed to update their emergency escape maps, so that in the event of a fire, employees and visitors would know where to run and where to gather. Doesn't sound much like an Excel job yet.

They had hand-drawn maps of some sites, architectural drawings from some sites, and pictures from a helicopter of one. And they had one electronic file! Some gifted employee had drawn a map in Paint, put it in an Excel file (for reasons never explained) and sent it in.

The project manager, a brilliant but non-technical guy, looked at all this and decided that Excel must be the tool to use. And they needed an expert, because, well, experts make them look better.

I have a policy to never visibly facepalm during a job interview. I followed my policy but the temptation was so strong.

I explained to him that Excel, while it was an awesome tool, was absolutely the wrong tool for the job. He was trying to drive nails with a CNC lathe. I recommended that he find somebody who was good with MS Visio. We shook hands and I left.

The temp agency called which I was driving home and asked me to spell 'Visio.' I did.

They called me back later that afternoon and asked if I knew how to use Visio? I do, it is really pretty simple. They told me that the boss had been impressed enough with my honestly suggesting he hire someone else that he wanted to hire me.

So I spent six months tracing Google Earth images of worksites and figuring out which escape routes fit our state's fairly vague rules for emergency escape maps. Easy work, nice people.  

The job could have been done in a fraction that time by a decent graphic designer, but they wanted me, I wanted the paycheck, and the work got done.",581,0,1,"Excel expert required for map project I was job hunting.

The only call that matters,"A few years ago I worked as tech-support for one of the largest tech companies in the world. I'd handled thousands of calls up to this specific one. Some are probably a great story of their own, but it doesn't matter. This is the only one worth telling. 

I actually really enjoyed that job. A lot of it probably was because I was rather good at it, not to sound full of myself, but it's rather important to the story. Most of the calls I received were not great technical mysteries you needed an engineering degree to figure out. They were about the people, and their lack of basic knowledge and understanding of the confusing technology, in their words. So I helped them. We reset passwords, restarted computers and plugged in chargers. All while keeping the conversation flowing and feeling natural, but always steering the conversation in the direction needed. It was smalltalk with a purpose, and I was great at it. I was always in control, except this one time. 

Not often but sometimes someone called in trying to get information that they had no right to. They were never successful. There are systems and procedures protecting against this, and they can't be argued with or broken. And I followed them to the letter. 

I received a call from a woman, which I early in the conversation believed were one of these calls. She asked me if I could help her get into her sons phone. My mind instantly went to that this kid had probably done something wrong, and the proof was on the phone, and I was suppose to help her get it. As it was not my job to judge bad parenting I asked her if she knew any of the passcodes he might have used. Since she probably wouldn't, my next step would stop her chances at getting access to what her son probably wouldn't want her to see. She of course replied she did not know, and that she did not want to completely lock the phone with entering the wrong code several times. This lead naturally into me explaining that to get access to the phone it needs to be restored and that this would also erase all the content. She quickly replied that she did not want to erase it, she wanted the photos on it. So my earlier suspicion was confirmed. 

I need to clarify that up to this point this have been a completely normal conversation, nothing unusual, other than the somewhat unusual request. With me wanting to end the conversation seeing we weren't getting anywhere, I told her the obvious solution she probably want to avoid. Just ask your son if he can unlock the phone for you. 

I have heard the expression that words can paint a picture, but I really hadn't understood the meaning up to this point. There was a moment of silence on the other end before she replied, I can't, he is dead. The way these words were said gripped me to my core. It was not the words themselves and it was not said while crying or with the intent to feel sorry for her. It was something bare and raw I had never experienced before. She showed me a piece of her soul in that moment, and my own welcomed hers and felt everything. For her something more precious than all else was just gone, and nothing could replace it, but she needed my help to treasure the memories. In this tiny moment I felt more connected to another human being than I ever have before. 

We both must have felt this moment and connection, because a moment later she told her story. It was as natural as talking to a good friend and in my heart I wanted to listen and just be there for her. Her son had been struggling for a while, and she had done all in her power to help him and make it better. Two days prior to her talking to me she had found her son in the woods behind their house. He had hanged himself from a tree. He was 15 years old. 

At this point my mind was not at work, following the rules and regulations. I was helping another human being, and I did everything I could possibly think of to help her get access to her sons photos. I probably would have been fired if my boss knew all the procedures I didn't follow that day, and I hadn't cared if I had. Unfortunately at the end I was not able to help her get access, the security at that point was just too well encrypted for my level of skill. Regardless she was very grateful for me trying to help in what way I could.

Well that's what cell towers are for!,"This happened a few years ago, but I just passed a sign that made me think of it.

So I manage a help desk for a not for profit agency that has lots of different types of workers, including staff with doctorates (psychology mainly). We tend to bend over backwards for them because they are fairly expensive and to have a Dr sitting on their thumb because tech isn't working is a huge money loss for us. So when tickets come in for them I often handle it personally.

So enough background. I get a call from a doctor that he just has a terrible time doing telemedicine from his home. He works with clients all over and it's easier and cheaper for him to work from one spot, instead of traveling and charging mileage and since doctor, he gets to pick the spot.

Issue boils down to his internet at home can't support his telemedicine in a high quality, no buffering format when his wife is working from home and his kids are watching movies/playing playstation. Well duh, you don't have enough bandwidth even though you have the best the sole ISP in the area can offer (according to him) So I offer a solution. Verizon Mifi, connect to his laptop and boom, he's on his own connection and things should be fine. A dozen other doctors use it not a problem. I order it, he stops in, I connect it test it and send him away.

Week later he calls, it's still not good enough and he really hates it on the laptop he wants an ipad because ""I want what I want and I heard they are the best"". So I grab a spare one and he comes in, I connect his mifi and send him on his way.

Another week same thing. It's too slow too slow. He tells me he has 4 bars of service so that shouldn't be the issue, it must be because it's a seperate device and not like another doctors that has a built in wireless card.

So I buy a brand new ipad from Verizon, set it all up test it and it still works beautifully and get it to him.

Another week, same problem. So I tell him I'm  coming out to his house to see what's up because they work fine from his work office on the days he comes in . Maybe he just happens to be right next to the microwave at home, or in his own personal farady cage idunno but I need eyes on. See the problem in person.


So I head to his nice affluent neighborhood with giant houses and see all these signs ""say no to the tower!"" ""No ugly tower"" ""cell towers bring down home values!"" and it dawns on me. He doesn't have cell service.

I get to his house and it's 1, maybe 2 bars of service (you know, it's always 4 when you ask them over the phone ) . I test every corner of his house with my signal app and it's garbage signal. I talk to him about the yard signs and he openly admits that his whole neighborhood is blocking a cell tower from being built nearby because ""it's an eyesore"". I explain that's why he has bad service but it's still not good enough. ""Can't you just use the cloud!?""

I end up finding a partial work around though. I tell him when he's at home and trying to work to TURN OFF THE TV that they have in the living room that they loop a youtube video , in HD, of calming oceanscapes and mountainsides. Rich people ambience I guess.  I also get his wife to switch to the Mifi for her work and music streaming since it's not video related AND I found out that he wasnt even on the 100mbps internet plan from the ISP, just the 50mbps because he just never called to switch it when it rolled out (they automatically shifted everyone after about 6 more months because a competitor was starting fiber in the area and they wanted to keep all the rich ~~suckers~~ clients)

"Student impatiently shoved floppy in upside down, destroying the drive and took PC offline","This was way back when I was in college working in the school computer lab, like back in late 1980's (or was it early 90's?). PC only has 3.5 inch floppy drives. Students have to save homework on them. To check-in, they go to the counter. We have a board with a little ID pocket for each PC available. Student gives the attendant (me) his or her ID, I slide it to the appropriate station's slot. They go to the PC. Our PC's have NO storage and boots off the network ROM, if you remember that far back. 

it was project time, and the lab is full, every machine is occupied, even the older ones with only 5.25 floppies. I know which students needs which. I send the students who were only logging into the local Mini computer to the 5.25 stations, to save the 3.5 stations for the other students doing homework on floppies. 

I had an ES (entitled student) coming up to the counter, slightly surly attitude. I swear I only checked her in minutes before. 

Me=Me

ES=entitled student

Me: Can I help you?

ES: I can't get my floppy out of the computer. 

I looked at the counter. There were like 4 people lined up for stations, but none were available. And I was the only staff on duty (I was a student, the lab supervisor is out to lunch).  I got one of the regulars to watch the counter (they can't move IDs, but at least they can tell students to wait), then I went to check the station. 

Sure enough, the disk is jammed tight. The eject button won't bring it out. 

So I use the tip on a pen cap to prop the slot flap open and look inside. 

And I see a silver thing. 

If you remember what a 3.5 inch floppy look like, you can see where this is going. If not, please refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk#%E2%80%8B3_1%E2%81%842-inch_disk) and look at the picture, then read the caption. 

WTF... 

Me: What happened? 

ES: Well, I put the disk in. 

Me: And? 

ES: it won't read.  And I can't get it out. 

I already understood what happened. She had shoved the disk in upside down. 

But I can just hear you exclaim, ""but that's impossible! It won't go in upside down!"" 

And indeed that won't happen if you are a NORMAL user. But ES was not a normal user. She shoved the disc in so hard, the pin that was supposed to prevent this from happening was bent 90 degrees.  Remember on the 3.5 floppy disk, right side up, the top left corner was clipped? That's where the pin was. She broke the pin. (I found this later, but I already guessed what had happened)

And there is no way to retrieve her disc without taking the PC apart, remove the floppy drive, then remove the cover of the floppy drive to access the disc. The drive is probably f(bleep)ed. 

Remember, 4... no wait, now 6 people are waiting for PCs, and 2 people are trying to check out. 

Me: I am afraid you'll have to come back later. 

ES: But I need the disc for my homework! 

Me: Sorry, nothing I can do. 

I go back to the counter and checked out the two that are leaving, and checked in two more.  The third guy (TG) asked:

TG: What about that one? (pointed at the one ES broke)

Me: Sorry, it's out of order. 

TG: But she was just using it.    (Yep, he's been here a while)

Me: She broke it. 

TG gave ES a death stare, but otherwise did nothing. It took another 15-20 minutes for another machine to open up. I was about to ask TG for his student ID to check him in when ES approached. 

ES: I was here first. Aren't you going to give me another machine?

Me: What are you going to do without your disc? 

ES sputtered. Apparently, she forgot about her floppy. 

ES: Can you lend me one? 

TG gave her the death stare again, but ES ignored it. 

Me: Nope, don't have any.  Try the student union, maybe? 

I got TG checked in, made another PC available, then checked in the guy behind him. The line is still a couple students deep. 

ES: Well? 

Me: Well what? 

ES: What about my disc? 

Me: What about it? 

ES: Aren't you going to get it out for me?

Me: I'm not allowed to open up the machines. I'm just the lab assistant. 

ES stomped her feet and walked out. 

Me: ""You forgot your ID!"" 

She came back, snatched it from my hand, and marched back out.  I had to make an ""out of order"" sign on the machine AND the ID holder board to stop students, desperate for machines, from asking me ""why can't I use that one"". Though when one of them said he just need terminal access, I let him get on that machine. 

We did get her disc out later that day. As I explained earlier, it was shoved in upside down and bent the blocking pin sideways. We had to replace the entire floppy drive. 

She never came back to reclaim her disc.

"Newbie solves a months-old head-scratcher problem in minutes, gets his victory dance","Or: the importance of a fresh pair of eyes on a problem.

During the team Zoom meeting earlier today, right at the end of the meeting in the 'any other business?' section, one of my colleagues (who's been there years, knows the datacentre inside out etc.) raises an important issue. Actually, two of them.

So we have a trio of Dell rack servers that are randomly shutting down. No rhyme or reason to it - during OS installs, under normal load, while doing nothing, 2 days, 2 hours, 2 weeks, totally random. Even more curious, the OS (RHEL) is shutting down, but there is absolutely no reason given - the system logs acknowledge the shutdown, but nothing before indicates what the reason is. They don't reboot, they shut down cold.

At this point, I've been with the company for 6 months as a Linux sysadmin, passed probation this month, but haven't really contributed a lot due to starting during COVID lockdown. So I offer my input, as I know Linux fairly inside-out by now. The boss acknowledges and offers the task to me.

I learn that the problem has been ongoing since August. There are two internal tickets involving several people, all trying different things - reinstalling the OS, dialling up the monitoring, upgrading the OS to the newer release, changes in the BIOS. Nothing seems to help. One of the trio came back immediately and has been fine since, but the other two continue to fail randomly. Tickets are raised with Dell. Dell request we run hardware diagnostics and send them the output. Dell draw a blank. They keep poking us asking if the machines are stable yet, clearly wanting to close the tickets, but we keep the tickets open and the servers keep crashing unpredictably.

So the first thing that springs to mind, me being fairly experienced with hardware as well, is that random shutdown problems are frequently temperature-related. One of the people involved in the problem also suggests temperatures. But there's nothing in the OS logs to suggest thermal shutdowns.

Well, they're rackmounts, let's go a level higher. Figure out which machine is which, then jump on the iDRAC (iLO) interface. Logs in it are equally sparse - the logs indicate shutdown occurred at the same time as the OS, but doesn't give a reason, just Reason SYS1003 for shutdown. Okay, how about temperatures?

There's a Thermals/Power tab, so that's my next stop. On the temperature monitor, everything looks normal. Interestingly, it logs the readings from the Intake Air Temperature for over a year. I download the complete logs as a CSV. Opening in LibreOffice, I see 3 columns - timestamp, average and peak degrees C for 1-hour intervals.

Without even scrolling down on the first machine, the problem is instantly visible. Line 1 after the headers:

`-128 -128 Thu Apr 21 10:01:05 2016`

Well that sure as heck doesn't look valid, does it.

Scroll down to the times indicated in the ticket. Right around the time the machine shuts down, guess what.

`-128 -128 Thu Aug 20 10:01:21 2020`

And there's hundreds of these readings. Scattered over 4 years of logs, but there, clear as day. Sometimes just once, sometimes for 12 hours straight.

So just like that, mystery solved - faulty temperature sensor. I open up the other two machines, and it's the same story. -128 degrees C right around each time the machines shut down. Evidently the iDRAC is receiving the faulty temperature signal, calculating that it's below the minimum threshold and sending an ACPI shutdown signal to the server.

I report my findings, update the tickets with the logs and sit back as people respond with surprise, both that Dell couldn't figure this out, and that they didn't notice. My total time spent for all 3 machines: &lt;15 minutes.

The original investigator goes back to Dell on the email thread and copy-pastes my diagnosis straight to them, cc'ing me, so I'll get to watch them squirm as well. I took a look at the hardware diagnostic file we sent to them - picking apart the .zip, sure enough I find Thermals.zip in one of the folders... and for reasons science cannot explain, the files within are *encrypted* \- I mean, what? Logs are all in plaintext, all the machine specs are in XML or JSON... but the temperature diagnostics are encrypted?

So for anyone wondering why Dell support is particularly hit and miss... and also how satisfying it is to jump in and solve a problem in minutes... I now know both pretty well...

Edit: Platinum?! I am humbled, kind Redditors, thank you!",3347,0,1,"Newbie solves a months-old head-scratcher problem in minutes, gets his victory dance Or: the importance of a fresh pair of eyes on a problem.

During the team Zoom meeting earlier today, right at the end of the meeting in the 'any other business?' section, one of my colleagues (who's been there years, knows the datacentre inside out etc.) raises an important issue. Actually, two of them.

So we have a trio of Dell rack servers that are randomly shutting down. No rhyme or reason to it - during OS installs, under normal load, while doing nothing, 2 days, 2 hours, 2 weeks, totally random. Even more curious, the OS (RHEL) is shutting down, but there is absolutely no reason given - the system logs acknowledge the shutdown, but nothing before indicates what the reason is. They don't reboot, they shut down cold.

At this point, I've been with the company for 6 months as a Linux sysadmin, passed probation this month, but haven't really contributed a lot due to starting during COVID lockdown. So I offer my input, as I know Linux fairly inside-out by now. The boss acknowledges and offers the task to me.

I learn that the problem has been ongoing since August. There are two internal tickets involving several people, all trying different things - reinstalling the OS, dialling up the monitoring, upgrading the OS to the newer release, changes in the BIOS. Nothing seems to help. One of the trio came back immediately and has been fine since, but the other two continue to fail randomly. Tickets are raised with Dell. Dell request we run hardware diagnostics and send them the output. Dell draw a blank. They keep poking us asking if the machines are stable yet, clearly wanting to close the tickets, but we keep the tickets open and the servers keep crashing unpredictably.

So the first thing that springs to mind, me being fairly experienced with hardware as well, is that random shutdown problems are frequently temperature-related. One of the people involved in the problem also suggests temperatures. But there's nothing in the OS logs to suggest thermal shutdowns.

Disaster strikes!,"So while I am not technically IT, I help our IT guy out from time to time.  I am one of the only 2 system administrators on our network.  I work in CNC in a manufacturing plant that makes plastics fasteners and our work system is an Oracle based database system.  One month ago, all hell broke loose.

A Monday evening, our IT lead gets a call from the second shift Quality Assurance lady.  She tells him that our system is acting funny and wont let her log in. He tries to remote into the server and is unable.  That's odd. So he remotes into another computer on the network and sees that someone has gained access to our server and is actively encrypting all our data.

Cue ""HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!""

I arrive the next morning and go to clock in and am told the server is down as is the entire network.  Cue me running to his office and find out that he has been there all night long.  He had arrived and immediately unplugged our modem and had spent most of the night figuring out what happened.

Turns out, one of our sales ladies fell for a phishing email and the first thing the outsiders did was delete our offsite backups and encrypt our on site ones. So we go into disaster recovery mode. Luckily our IT manager had a second offsite backup that was only a few months old.

Final tally, 30 computers wiped, 8 had Ubuntu installed and were raffled off once all company data was gone, 10 new PCs ordered and set up (including 2 in our CNC department), our domain controller and all users completely rebuilt from the ground up, an onsite backup to 2 2tb USB SSDs that are unplugged when its done, possible on site training for all employees for security, and about 3 and a half weeks of pure insanity.  Also my liver. We also tightened down user rights and severely limited user control over ANYTHING.

But the company bought me a good bottle of bourbon since IT isn't even my department! Also I may have acquired some hardware to build my wife a gaming PC.  I can neither confirm or deny anything.

"Nobody cares if the backups work, only if the restore does","We have a server that is, for all practical purposes, the company. It runs our point of sale system, tracks inventory, handles orders, keeps all the accounting records, everything. In short, it is Very Important. There are many quirks to this system (""We recommend you don't run this function, even if we told you to""), and it's a horrible mish-mash of contradictory ideas bolted together over the decades, and it's the worst system out there - except for all the rest. It's the only one that scales up enough to meet our needs that is designed specifically for the type of retail we are. All in all, it does what we need it to do, even if we want to light it on fire occasionally.

The old server was at the end of its life cycle, so we replaced it. The new server cost More Than My Car, not surprisingly. Because it is Very Important, we do nightly backups (with provisions to recover stuff that occurs to the day if we have to, but that's not part of this tale). The normal backups are to a network device, which, in turn, transfers an encrypted copy to the cloud run by the vendor we got this Very Important server that cost More Than My Car from. Sometimes, it doesn't work quite perfectly. So we have a backup tape drive. Normally, the tape drive is left turned off, but if we have issues, or think we might possibly have issues, or someone driving by on the street said the word issues, it's easy to turn back on. We're a little paranoid (from painful experience) about backups, so it is not optional.

So we replace this Very Important server that costs More Than My Car, and the new one, of course, includes a tape drive, and even included enough brand new tapes for a weekly cycle, plus a spare, and not one but *two* cleaners!. Very generous of them.

Except that when I start to label the tapes, it will label one, but not be able to read the label. And after that first time, it won't relabel the same tape, either, but will label another brand new one (but not read it afterwards). Various errors appear on the little tiny LED display on the front of the drive, including asking for the cleaning tape several times in the space of a half hour. Sigh.

Well, it's brand new, and we have the highest level of warranty available from the manufacturer, and a service contract that also costs more (per year) than my car. They'll make it work. Eventually. (And it's the backup to the backup, so to speak, so it's not exactly an emergency. So far.)

So our vendor remotes in and logs into the iDRAC system, and pokes and prods, and does tests, and consults with the tea leaves, and perhaps sacrifices a chicken to the Elder Gods, and decides that it is not, in fact, the wrong tapes (as they had originally thought), but just a bad (brand new, major brand name) drive. So they consult with the manufacturer, and do some more poking and prodding and reading of tea leaves, and perhaps move up to sacrificing a goat to the Elder Gods, and the manufacturer sends out a tech to replace the drive. This is basically what we expect, though it took longer than it should have (which is to day, it wasn't the same day).

I'm in the field at another location when the tech arrives, and my boss (bless his black heart), while more tech savvy than most, does not think to *test the drive* before the tech leaves (he, the boss (bless his black heart) that is, that is, was anxious to get the server back up and running, and the stores back online). I get back, and go to start labeling the tapes, and . . . they won't even go in the drive. No power LED on the front, nothing. Like it has no power. Sigh. I felt the odds were that the tech didn't get a cable plugged in quite right, but I wasn't going to open the case of a Very Important server that cost More Than My Car that was brand new with a factory warranty that was less than a week old.

So another call to the vendor, who calls the manufacturer, who arrange to send out another (different) tech. Just in case it was two bad drives in a row, they ship another replacement directly to us, which gets delayed in shipping, and is scheduled to arrive . . . half an hour after the store closes (which is to say, 9:30 PM), on a Friday, when weekends are the busiest days of the week. So I reschedule the tech's arrival with the dispatcher for early Monday. Ten minutes later, the tech calls, wondering if I knew that his arrival had been rescheduled, and why. Communications is a wonderful thing, and they should try some.

So Monday arrives, as does the tech (and 8:00 AM had become 11:00 AM), and I spend half an hour trying to track down the package that the shipper confirmed was delivered that morning (with a signature that matched one of our employees) - remember that 9:30 PM Friday delivery time? We're open both weekend days for longer hours than the shipper works - and we tell the stores to go offline for a short time for what should be a simple job.

A short time, indeed.

The tech opens the case, and sure enough, as soon as he touched the cable, it came off in his hand. The first tech hadn't plugged it in right (or, really, at all). Button the case back up, fire that baby up, and we have a power LED on the front of the drive! Whoopee! It takes a good ten minutes for it to go through the hardware checks and actually boot up, but the drive takes the tape. The tech agrees to hang out long enough for me to label a tape and read the label back to make sure everything is working. Except everything isn't working. The labeling program gets to where it's starting the process and . . . just sits there for *way* longer than it takes to label a tape. No error, no timeout, just sits there. Sigh.

We manage to deduce the new password (don't ask) for the iDrac and get logged into it, and we find no evidence of any tape drive anywhere (though neither of us really knew where to look), nor do I see it in the hardware configuration screen in the admin panel of the live server. So the tech calls for backup, an engineer of some sort at the manufacturer's internal support desk. And he's very knowledgeable. Perhaps too knowledgeable, and easily distracted by brightly colored objects (like the computer screen in front of him), and every on-topic thing he says leads to an aside to a tangent to an interesting factoid and so on. And he talks at . . . about . . . half . . . the . . . normal . . . speed . . . for . . . human . . . beings. But he knows where to look for the tape drive in the iDRAC.

Another reboot later, we can clearly see the drive in the iDRAC, so the hardware appears to be working correctly. But there's still no evidence of it in the admin panel on the live server. OK, I'm not actually all that surprised. It's not uncommon to have to manually reinitialize the drive within the backup software, which is well beyond my skillset (and the passwords I have), but something our vendor will handle with ease. Not the factory tech's problem, at any rate, and he has other calls. So after listening to the engineer give us the complete history of goat sacrifices, with an aside on the personality profiles of the Elder Gods and why the color purple is superior in all respects to the flavor of lima beans, we wrap it up and I let the tech go.

Within a few minutes of him leaving, I find the tape drive listed in the admin panel. Apparently, it will automatically recognize a hardware change, but requires a reboot afterwards to use the new setting, and still takes some time to get everything set up. (It's frustrating when I have no idea why something's not working, but it's terrifying when I have no idea why it *started* working again.) But it will now label the tape, and read the label. Victory over the Forces of Chaos at last!

So I turn on the tape backup for the final, real, only test that matters that night. Will it actually perform a backup? Come in the next morning, and . . . there's no backup in the log, not even a failed attempt. Sigh. This is becoming tedious.

But, before I spend a half hour digging through the logs, and bother our platinum account rep when I don't understand what I'm seeing, I notice that the backup history has transferred over from the old server, and that the last tape backup was on tape A. Which happens to be the same tape that was inserted. And, like any good backup system for a Very Important server that cost More Than My Car, that is the heart and soul of a multi-state retail chain that does many millions of dollars a year of business, it won't do a backup over (what it believes is) the most current tape, even if the actual tape in the drive is blank (and a different, and completely incompatible type).

So in the end, the backup failed *because* everything was working right.

(And now the main backups are failing sporadically because we're using the old server for training, and every time we plug it into the network, it messes up something relating to the network backup. Even though we have a) turned off the service, b) changed all the settings for the service to point to places that don't exist, and c) de-licensed the backup software.

The tale of the mysterious keyboard and the yoga ball mat,"This happened a few summers ago when I was a desktop support temp just trying to learn the ropes. Some users had desktops and others had laptops with docking stations depending on their role(important for the story). It doesn’t matter we support both.

This user had been having trouble for about a week(as far as we know) where their keyboard would mysteriously type random letters and numbers for no reason. She would be typing and random letters and numbers would show up too. The only way for her to fix it was for her to restart her computer and it would come back soon after. 

With this information from the user we started trouble shooting. There isn’t much you can do but reinstall the drivers or replace the keyboard. So that’s what we did, the drivers were replaced and it kept happening. That’s when I was sent with a few others to investigate this super weird issue on site.

This user had a standard setup with a laptop and docking station where a normal user would close the laptop and work off of the separate monitor and keyboard. She decided she liked the laptop keyboard better and the ability to use it as a second screen. 

When we approached it was difficult to keep from laughing since it was apparent what the problem was. The user had just bought a half yoga ball mat to rest her legs on. She had also decided since she didn’t like the separate keyboard that she would put it on the ground WHILE KEEPING IT PLUGGED IN. Which is how the yoga ball mat ended up on top of the keyboard.

Here is the theory: She would work and want to rest her legs so she would put them on the yoga ball mat which would press the keys when she moved it. Then she would get frustrated take her legs off the yoga ball mat to restart the laptop fixing the problem. And then restart the process.

Client: It's the printer's fault!,"One of the clients that I had in the past used a customized database system to create/track invoices.  One day I get a call from one of their offices from a client complaining that something is wrong with their printer.

Me: What issue are you having with the printer?

User: It's printing the wrong information on the invoices that I'm generating.  It has the wrong date and address.  We moved to a new office about a month ago and it's still printing our old address! You need to fix the printer!

Me: Ok.  What is the invoice number that you are having issues with?  Also, I will need your new address so I can update it in the database.

User: It's the printer.  The printer name is CompanyX/Printer1234.

Me: That is not what I asked for.  I need the invoice number to see if there is a data entry error and your new address so I can update the database with it.

User: No! It's the printer that is the problem!  Fix the printer!

Needless to say, I had to go around this user to get the information I needed.  Checking the invoice, it was a data entry error by that user and after fixing that and updating their office's address in the database, the invoice printed with the correct information.

"It's not your alarm, man!","Hey, guys! Back with another fun security tech story. This happened just last (Sunday) night, and will be filed under my more interesting on-call memories. This is also posted in r/talesfromsecurity. 

Received a service ticket for a house the company monitored which was sold last year. The alarm monitoring account was deactivated by the new homeowner. He's been using it as  a glorified door chime. But, for some reason which was never really made clear, he needed the disarm code. 

Prior to contacting the homeowner, I was told by one of our dispatchers that he was calling the previous owner for her code. After allowing him time to do this, I called... with him claiming he was not aware that was even an option. I allowed him more time to do this, and he promised to call back after he gets the code.

We managed to silence the system, but he tells me that every 10-15 seconds there is a sequence of four long beeps. It's hard for me to hear over the phone, but I did catch it every so often. He's convinced it's one of his smoke detectors, but all of my records show that they are hardwired, so there would be no low battery warning.

I asked if he is using the same type of phone as I am, so we can video chat, as the audio and video together might be helpful. He agreed, and we spent nearly half an hour troubleshooting every possibility. Nothing works.

Finally, in utter desperation, I happened to mention that I have had calls in the past where the issue is completely unrelated to our alarm system. He said, ""wait a minute, I think it might be..."", as he walked back to where the beeps were the loudest.

I heard a cabinet open. ""I think it's my microwave!"" I am floored. It took everything in me to not burst into laughter. He repeated, ""Yeah, I think it's my microwave."" I just heard some beeps, as all I could see was the ceiling and the very top of his head. Internally, in that moment, I am both laughing and screaming. I apologized that we did not realize this earlier, and I ended the call politely and professionally, wishing him a good night.

I immediately began laughing so hard, my lungs hurt and I feared I might pass out from oxygen deprivation. My wife, sitting about six feet from me, and had heard the entire video call, began to laugh along with me. I called the dispatcher to advise that the issue was resolved, and that we ended up troubleshooting his microwave.

All in all, it was a good night.

EDIT: We confirmed that the smokes which were installed are indeed hardwired to the panel, which runs off the household electrical service, and the only battery involved is a 12V brick inside the panel.

Your software is making all of our computers beep. How do we make it stop?,"We received a support ticket from a customer who stated that our software was causing all of their computers to beep and they needed to know what to do to make it stop. We went back and forth a few times with them trying to diagnose things via the support ticket system but nothing made sense . Out software only produces a sound when an error or alert appears and you'd only hear it if you had a sound card and speakers. We decide it's time to call them so I get on the phone.

I give them a call and sure enough, you can hear loud beeping. It sounds familiar but I can't quite identify it so I start asking basic troubleshooting questions. They tell me there's no speakers and that the computers have never made sound before so just to be sure I ask them to look at the back of the computer and see if there is a sound card and if anything plugged in to it. 

Well, well, well, this is where I finally get my answer. She tells me that she can't see behind the computer because the power is out and it's really dark. That's when that familiar sound finally makes sense! Their UPSs were beeping at them. What the heck? We're almost 30 minutes into this from the first support ticket and this is the first time I'm hearing that the power is out. How did they not think this would important information to share? I never even thought to ask because I just assume it's something you share right away. One I told her what I thought was making the sound she laughed and admitted to me that she felt really dumb.

"My laptop vibrates, even when it’s off. You must send a technician right away!","In the mid-90s I did Mac tech support for schools and businesses in Chicagoland. Our biggest clients were the public school systems. I had to dispatch our technicians to some pretty awful school environments, but today’s call came from one of the wealthiest school districts.

She called me in a panic early Monday morning to say that her PowerBook (that’s a laptop, kids) was vibrating, and she didn’t know why.

“Is it making unusual noises?” “No.”

“Is the hard drive spinning wildly?” “No.”

“Does it happen when you shut the lid?” “Yes.”

*Hmm.*

“Does it happen when you shut it down completely?” *”Yes.”*

“Is it on a desk, table, or podium?” “A table.”

“Is the table pushed up against the wall?” *”Yes.”*

*”Does it stop if you pull the table a few inches from the wall?”* **”Yes!”**

*”Does it stop if you pick it up off the table?”* **”Yes!!!”**

I looked at the calendar on the wall. October. 

I checked the temperature outside. 50s.

Floppy Disk Mail is as good as Email.,"We had a customer once who couldn't get one of their workstations logged into the software. It's urgent, they need to prepare for a busy weekend and they need to get this resolved  as soon as possible. They're unable to tell us what errors, if any, are appearing. Why? Who knows, sometimes customers are stubborn and want you to fix it without any effort on their end. They don't want to provide us with a remote connection so we ask them to email us some information about the application launcher settings, and they promise to get it to us right away. 

We didn't hear from them again so we assumed they solved the problem on their own. Until about a week later when a padded envelope arrives. Inside this envelope is a 3.5"" floppy disk that had just a little bit of dried food on it. But that's all there was, just some dried food, no note, no label, just dried food and a return address we don't recognize. We stick this in our electronics junk yard to be tossed out.

A few days later we get an angry call from the customer wanting to know why their workstation isn't working yet. We explain that we never received an email from them or a call saying they still needed help. This is when we're told that their tech guy got the information we needed and emailed it. When we tell them that we didn't receive anything from then they call the tech guy and discover that rather than email us, he put the info we needed on a floppy disk and mailed it.

So here we are almost 2 weeks after the initial issue that had to be solved before that weekend. We get an OLD computer, unplug it from the network, and put the floppy in to see what's going on. The tech guy copied the shortcut onto the floppy disk and that's all. When we tell them that they haven't provided us with the information we need and that the fastest way to help them is to provide us remote access, they call the tech guy back in. He shows up the next day and to get us connected, he had to connect this computer to the network so it has internet access. I'll say that again, HE HAD TO CONNECT THE COMPUTER TO THE NETWORK. 

Yeah, the only problem they had was that the network cable had been unplugged. In all these years I've seen just about kind of person claiming to be an IT professional.

Sales Tax... of DOOM,"This story happened shortly after a major natural disaster in my area. Not related to the disaster itself but the event set in motion the events of this story.

In the aftermath, the state I was in decided to add a half cent ""temporary"" sales tax to fund infrastructure repairs (side grumble, 30 years later that temporary tax is still in place). 

Since I was working in Point of Sales, I had the ridiculous job of going to ALL of my companies customers to reprogram their machines for the new sales tax. Our customer base covered most of the north part of our state so it was a huge job.

This one in particular stands out. 

As I walk through the door the store owner is already yelling at me. He's mad because its been a week since the tax change went into effect and we are only just getting to him. On top of that he's livid that my company is charging him for the call.

Well, I can't help the first part because we had to do some triage. Our big store multi register clients got priority. His little two register mini mart just had to wait a bit.

The second part, I kind of agreed with. The company should have at least been giving discounts. As it was it came across as gouging even though we didn't raise our rates. But maintaining the one hour minimum for a five minute service call was kind of a dick move. In any case that wasn't my call.

So with the owner glaring over my shoulder I enter the new program and save it. Then I print out the program to confirm its in correctly. The receipt printer starts up and then ""POOF"", the machine dies and all the magic blue smoke comes out.

Owner was beyond livid. Blames my program entry for destroying his cash register, and since I had just exploded his machine as I was programming it I really couldn't refute the argument!

So I get my kit from the truck and open up the machine. Turns out that the printer motor was on its very last legs. Brushes had worn down so far that they eventually shorted out. Lucky me it happened just as I started my print!

I explained this to the owner and showed him the failed part. Then I replaced the printer and got the machine running again. Didn't even charge him for the part. 

Even so the owner refused to believe my programming didn't kill his machine and wouldn't let me program the second machine. I later discovered he eventually called in a competitor from the neighboring service region to finish the job.

So that's how my malicious programming skills lost us a customer. I only WISH I had that power!",362,0,1,"Sales Tax... of DOOM This story happened shortly after a major natural disaster in my area. Not related to the disaster itself but the event set in motion the events of this story.

The laser sharp Spec (ft. the world’s most comprehensive KB),"So, at my work there’s a department with manufacturing equipment and so there’s a specialist there to keep them running &amp; help people using them. This is a newly created role for that year as the former department head (HoD) used to do it themselves. The department is quite small, 2 core staff (now 3) with several hundred other users each month. I won’t give specifics about why there’s hundreds of users needing a specialist and 2 other core staff as I don’t want to blow my account &amp; it isn’t risky enough for a throwaway or alt.

One piece of equipment is a laser cutter made by an Austrian based international manufacturer of, believe it or not, laser cutters, laser engravers and laser markers, whose name rhymes with turtleneck. This cutter uses a program to control jobs to be cut and lay them out on the plate to make best use of the material. You import a job into this control software by printing it from your design software to a software printer that converts it to a the control format.

On this fateful day the specialist (Spec) calls in a ticket to our fabulous onsite IT helpdesk to let us know about the computer that drives this laser cutter is slow to log on/off (site wide problems atm) and generally lethargic plus unusual problems with the control software. Requesting it to be rebuilt.

I swing by towards the end of the day and get to work finding out what is wrong specifically (why do people never tell you specifically what’s up in the first place?). After dropping by his office ( material store room) I find out it is flagging an error about not being able to fit a single job on the plate. He say’s that he used this machine type and the design software in his last place, knowing both inside out. So I log on with a fresh (factory new) test account, turn on the laser machine and sit in the wind tunnel produced by 4 140mm fans blowing onto the laser driver engine thingy (where laser is made laser), someone really needs to make a baffle to protect you from that jet blast, but I digress.

I am able to replicate the error, so do what any tech worth their salt does when faced with an unfamiliar error, consult the greatest knowledge base known to mankind - Google. 1st result is the manufacturer’s website with a list of common errors and causes. Guess what it’s there, that fault code. ‘Workpiece is bigger than space available on plate, check workpiece size’. I know my beautiful drawing of a small circular is way smaller than the 300 x 450 plate, possibly 10x10mm?. Like I said above it is imported by printing it into the software - I vaguely remember the old HoD showing me where you adjust the print size while testing after I migrated this box over to win10 last year, the print properties. You see it defaults to 500x500, all you do is tick the box to match the size of the work piece to the size of the design an click ok. So I do that and lo and behold it works. I communicate this over and log off.

I am chatting to the DepHoD (other core staff member) a week later about troubles with MS teams and the damned WIFI, when I ask if there’s been any other troubles with the laser cutter since. And no there haven’t, I tell him I just googled it and he remarks that the Spec does have a tendency to claim to know everything there is to know about everything. I’m sure we’ll meet again some day, probably when complaining about the router not working (not the internet router, but the CNC one. And fellow brits, this one is pronounced the American way (ra-oww-tor) instead of  proper way (root-er).)

Ridiculous Expectations,"Received a call today from a customer who recently purchased software (Office365) through our online store. They wanted to know when we’d be installing the software. I explained I could assist with downloading and installing the application but that we don’t actually do it for customers. The guy seemed like this was unreasonable and actually expected us to install the Office applications on 60 computers in their office. 

He was like “what am I paying you $900 a month for”? I explained that’s for email, office applications, and other collaboration tools like Teams. His response was “well how do I use them if you dont install them?!?”  

Where the hell do these people come from? What software do you buy and the reseller come to your office and install it? Except expensive specialty software that’s requires thousands in professional services to get up and running. If he bought office from Walmart would he have expected them to install it for him?",273,0,1,"Ridiculous Expectations Received a call today from a customer who recently purchased software (Office365) through our online store.

Your software caused a fire and we need you to pay for damages.,"A customer who uses our software had never ending network issues called us threatening legal action if we didn't reimburse them for damages resulting from a fire. This was a small restaurant and one workstation was always freezing, needing to be rebooted, its connected printers never worked, etc. We always recommended they hire an IT professional to come out and check the computer and network connection and one day they finally did.

The only problem was that this IT professional was the restaurant owner's brother and was neither knowledgeable in IT nor professional. In the course of his troubleshooting, a fire started inside the wall near the network jack and they had to smash the wall to get to it and put it out, at least that's the story they gave me. In his professional opinion, our software had sent several high voltage pulses through the network and caused the fire. 

I tried explaining to the restaurant owner that what she was telling me was impossible and she got irate and I assume started yelling at me in Hindi and after I tell her I can't understand her she tells me she'll have her brother call me and hangs up. A few minutes later her brother calls and he starts yelling at me and wanting an apology for calling him a liar and that he has a PhD and he knows exactly what happened. He gives me the same story, that our software sent out this high voltage pulse and started a fire. I'm not even sure where to begin with a rebuttal so I just use my standard question when speaking to a incompetent IT guy, ""Have you consulted with an IT professional?"" This set him off in the most glorious way and after yelling and cussing at me for a bit he hangs up.

About a week later the restaurant owner calls and says she has a new computer and wants our assistance installing the software on it. No mention of the previous incident at all, it's like it never even happened I guess. I wonder if she got a second opinion and realized her brother is a failure.",3309,0,1,"Your software caused a fire and we need you to pay for damages.

Your software's security flaws cost us thousands of dollars!,"This customer used one of our software packages and when they added another workstation, they chose to do it themselves and rather than deal with an IT professional, they shared out C: on each computer to everyone. By the way, they were using very old all in one touchscreen machines running Windows 98. Summer comes along and they decide to offer free internet to their guests via WiFi and so they put an unsecured access point in a common area and attach that access point to their network. That same network at isn't in the least bit secure. Shortly after this we get a call wanting us to figure out why their software has stopped working. They're a pretty close drive for one of our employees so they head on over the next morning and discover that not only is our software missing, but so is nearly everything else. In the root of C: there's a new readme.txt and it explains that the person who did this was just driving by looking for unsecured WiFi and wanted to teach them a lesson. 

The owner of this business had a lawyer send us a really nasty letter explaining how we were negligent in allowing our software to operate like this and that we were responsible for the costs of having an IT Professional recover this data and for loss of business. We sent the lawyer back support ticket notes and emails showing that the customer chose to install on their own and also that we had provided installation instructions that clearly state how important data security is and to never do the things they did. We also recommended the layer contact an IT professional and get their opinion on giving guests unrestricted access to an unsecured network of outdated computers running operating systems that had reached their end of life years prior. 

We never heard back from the lawyer but the business owner called us to have us do the software install on all new, up to date computers. He had also hired an IT professional to oversee things. That was an expensive lesson for him.",598,0,1,"Your software's security flaws cost us thousands of dollars!

They're a pretty close drive for one of our employees so they head on over the next morning and discover that not only is our software missing, but so is nearly everything else. In the root of C: there's a new readme.txt and it explains that the person who did this was just driving by looking for unsecured WiFi and wanted to teach them a lesson. 

The owner of this business had a lawyer send us a really nasty letter explaining how we were negligent in allowing our software to operate like this and that we were responsible for the costs of having an IT Professional recover this data and for loss of business. We sent the lawyer back support ticket notes and emails showing that the customer chose to install on their own and also that we had provided installation instructions that clearly state how important data security is and to never do the things they did. We also recommended the layer contact an IT professional and get their opinion on giving guests unrestricted access to an unsecured network of outdated computers running operating systems that had reached their end of life years prior. 

We never heard back from the lawyer but the business owner called us to have us do the software install on all new, up to date computers. He had also hired an IT professional to oversee things. That was an expensive lesson for him."
"Your software keeps uninstalling itself, we want a refund.","This customer refused to get training after purchasing almost every product we have. We provide a certain window of free support just to make sure they get running smoothly even if they don't want proper on site training, which isn't free so the cheap customers never get it.

About a month after the free support ends we start getting calls that the software has uninstalled itself. We connect remotely and reinstall, get them set up, restore the data from a backup, etc. This goes on for a couple months, almost every week. That's when the owner calls and wants a conference call with management to discuss a refund.

I'm on the call and this is my first time hearing about it so I request remote access to check some things out. When our software uninstalls, it logs all the details and takes screenshots. And there, in a folder that isn't the install folder, I check the logs. Their ""IT Professional"" who was the owner's nephew was logging in and uninstalling, clicking all the ""OK"" and ""Are You Sure"" buttons. The owner yelled at us for snooping and being unethical but they didn't get a refund.

Got waylaid by vampires...,"An earlier post reminded me of this...

Back in the early 2000's I worked for a hardware manufacturer as a field service flunky.

We used early Blackberries to receive service calls and send messages to our call tracking system when we arrived at a customer location, and when we left. I would also include such nuggets of information as ""replaced thus and such component"" to jog my memory when closing out my service calls.

One day I was visiting one of the locations for our largest customer, and they were having a Red Cross blood drive in one of their conference rooms. So when I was leaving, I stopped and gave blood.

In my offsite message I mentioned that I'd been waylaid by vampires on my way out.

The following week I was talking with one of the managers at the corporate headquarters about something and he said ""what did you mean last week by being waylaid by vampires?""

That's how I found out that at least one person would read the contents of the notes on service calls. It didn't stop me from putting in things to amuse myself, though. :)",245,0,1,"Got waylaid by vampires... An earlier post reminded me of this...

There's a flashing orange light and a strange smell.,"This customer had a workstation that may have been a gaming PC at one time because it had a clear panel on the side. One of the employees calls us saying they can't get the computer to turn on and that every time they press the power button there is a weird orange flashing light that sparkles a bit and then it turns off again. She also mentions a strange smell but can't quite describe it. We provide software only, not hardware services so we advise them to contact their IT professional and to not touch that power button again.

A couple hours later we get a call from someone who tells us that the computer is fried and they need to do install the software on a new computer. That flashing orange light was apparently some chip getting so hot it was glowing. The smell was both that chip burning and the massive layer of sticky dust catching fire. I hear they perform regular maintenance on their equipment now.",233,0,1,"There's a flashing orange light and a strange smell.

Excel and printing.,"Back when I did field service on desktops, laptops, printers, and other computer related equipment, I got a service call about a printer at one of our biggest customers.

The issue was that this one person, when printing a specific Excel worksheet, the shaded cells would no longer print the text inside the shading.

The printer in question was an HP LaserJet 5si, and was usually pretty bulletproof for these kinds of things.

Since it would only reproduce with the one person, with one Excel worksheet, it shouldn't be a hardware issue (thus appropriate for me), but I dove into it anyway.

The worksheet was huge (at the time) and pulled data via ODBC from many varied sources and then massaged the data.

I did the trick of copying the data and pasting into a new spreadsheet file. Issue reproduces.

Created a new spreadsheet, shaded some cells, added text, prints fine with no issue.

I installed the LaserJet 4si printer drivers, and printed the problem spreadsheet, and the issue was gone.

So the work around of using the driver for an older model of printer was the fix, but it took a couple of hours to get there. We billed the customer anyway, for something their own desktop support folks should have done.",101,0,1,"Excel and printing.

One Excel workbook crashed my PC...,"So, I'm not tech support, I'm just a regular desk jockey. However, I'm not an idiot. I've got an A+ and a Network+ and had a couple of old MS certs that have expired. Since I'm one of the few people that have some tech skills, I sometimes get to fix stuff that's broken. Sometimes I fix stuff if it annoys me enough. I have a co-worker who is 15 years younger than I am and has two college degrees that has no idea how a computer works. I got my first PC after I graduated from high school in the early 90's. I should be the old man that doesn't understand computers.

Well, we're all working from home and doing our duties. I get to be backup for those duties. Simple things that are less than one person's job but easy to do. Plus, somebody has to do these type of things while people take PTO. Backup duties get handed around. Several of us cover for each other. Today, my co-worker asks me to cover for her on the big client. She's had PC issues. A lot of PC issues. Her friend is coming over at lunch to figure them out.

One of them is easy to diagnose. (Bad inverter cable or bad inverter board itself.) Her friend is coming over to figure out why it flickers and why it runs so slowly. She asks me to run the big client today. No problem. Make some support tickets if any show up, check on the current support tickets, and keep the big client informed. Keep the big client happy. So, I check my folders in Outlook and download yesterday's Excel workbook. The workbook is the daily report that we send them. Sure, it's simple, but it works. Then I open the workbook...

It takes four minutes and a GB of RAM. I have no idea why. I keep poking around trying to figure out if it's infected. Is it running some weird formula? Some crazy reference? I don't really know Excel as well as I should. I complain to her about the workbook in Teams. By this time, her friend has showed up, she's going to lunch to get her PC inspected, and I start working on this stupid Excel workbook.

She comes back from lunch. She's getting a new screen and he removed some bloatware. I ask, ""Do you use these tables?""

""What's a table?""

This workbook has seven total sheets. Two for current issues, and the rest are past five months. All months before that have been moved to a second workbook. Of course, both of them combined are too large to email, so they have to be zipped up to be sent every day.

I look at the sheets and each one has a table maxed out. About 65,000 rows and the columns go to triple letters. I message the boss about this workbook. He says, ""Actually, that's probably just the one that I made for her. She's probably still using the same one."" He clearly just clicked the upper left corner and tabled the whole stupid thing.

So, I go to the last two sheets and un-table them. The file gets bigger. As I un-table the third sheet, Excel freezes. I watch in task manager as it slowly climbs up to 2.5 GB of RAM. My fan sounds louder than I've ever heard it. Force reboot. Tables are pretty good at storing formatting according to the Googles. Having infinite formatting without tables is quite hard on Excel, I guess. That also explains why the file got larger. It explains why it was worse even though I was saving it in between edits.

At that point, a friend of mine comes up with the simplest solution. Make a new workbook and copy\\paste the data over. I'd been wrestling with this thing for hours. I'm an idiot for trying so hard. I do just as he advised. I format the cells out to 500 rows and about a hundred columns and freeze the top row. Whole thing takes about a hour while doing my regular work. At most, this thing has 166 rows of data. This thing is so sloppy that I realize there are actually about 200 worthless columns hidden in the middle of it.

In the end, she's excited that I kept her ""easy to read"" formatting and added back the old months. Even with the added five months of data, I reduced the size of the workbook from 91 MB to 818 KB. I should know better than this. When trying to fix a problem, it really can boil down to one simple Excel workbook screwing up the whole PC.

EC: yeah uhm yer device ain't connecting to my internet.

Me: ok maam so your device will not connect to your wifi is that right?

EC: did I stutter?

Me: no maam i am just checking if i understood your concern correctly, now where was this device purchased?

EC: I bought it at *shopping center* 

Me: ok maam now just to check what message is displayed on your tv screen right now?

EC: It says ""incorrect password cannot connect.""

Me: ok thanks so...I think we can easily get through this by typing the password to your wifi

Cue EC entitlement and ....

EC: So whats the password?

Me: confused pause, I'm sorry maam I don't quite follow

EC: look poindexter I'm paying for internet connection and I AM A VALUED CUSTOMER so don't waste my time and give me my damn password

Me: uhh maam that password would be what you and your family uses to connect to your wifi, we do not set that as our support is only for the roku device not your internet service.

EC: Don't give me that, just give me my damn password and stop wasting my time! I don't need to know my password coz I paid for it and have always been connected to the wifi in my own house so if this is some type of ploy to get me to fork over more money for a g¥$$amn password you got another thing comin.

Wild teenage daughter appears

TD: Mom! Put the phone down now!

EC:But this little poindexter is tryin ta get me to pay....

TD: No he is not now put the phone down.

EC: But...

TD: Now mom or I'm calling Dad

Apparently I'm polite but useless.,"Years back, I was working for a small, struggling company. We made software that helped nonprofits track, thank, and encourage their donors, so our clients were generally small nonprofits with limited tech skill but real passion for whatever their organization did. This was the one tech job I've ever had where nobody swore at me.

This is the story of my worst caller.

Neville (not his name, of course) ran a small museum in an eastern state (of the USA). He had a fairly small donor database, which he used once a year. Every year, he would call us up to complain that the FLOPPY DISKS that he stored his database on had failed. Again. Which was of course our fault.

Did he have a backup? Oh, you sweet summer child.

His organization's record was populated with annual complaints that we had lost his database, followed by our begging him to burn a CD, or send us his data, or use decent backups. Each entry was signed by the tech who worked with him, and a heartfelt plea to never talk to him again.

I was new that year, and didn't know what was coming. It **was** a bit odd that all the other techs were hanging out at my cube door watching me. I think I saw a few exchanging money- bets.

Neville spent ten minutes explaining how useless our software was, with a few jabs towards my intelligence and education. I made interested noises as I mostly ignored his ranting and read the file.

I knew what he was going to want before he even finished griping. And I was right.

""So I want you to fix this data thing!""

Floppy number four of seven had failed (as they do) and the only copy of his datafile was corrupt. Our software had no tools with which to recover a datafile with a big bite taken out of the middle. He had no backup, despite four recorded pleas in his file to back things up. I don't know if he stored his floppies in a magnet co0llection or what, but this was what he called about every year.

I talked him through the basics. Try a different computer, maybe that drive is faulty. I could hear him not moving out of his chair and not trying another computer as he assured me that he was doing that.

I asked if there was another copy somewhere? (didn't use the word 'backup' because I was trying to speak his language). He snorted.

I asked how many donors he had added this year? He had, after all, sent the data file to us (every year) so we had last year's file. Nope. He wasn't sure if he had added any new donors but he wanted THIS file, not last year's.

I was trying to figure out how to walk him through undeleting the file on his hard drive, where he thought he might have worked on it some months ago, when he lost patience.

""You are useless! Polite, but useless."" SLAM goes the phone.

The lead tech ostentatiously looked at her watch and held out her hand to her junior, who passed over a ten. Apparently I had kept him from hanging up for longer than the rest had expected.

I documented it and added my plea to never, ever talk to Neville again to his file, and closed it for this year.

"Mam, that's a faraday cage.","This one happened to me today and I can not stop laughing at it.

Phone call regarding wifi not working in a lady's room but works everywhere else in the house. 

&gt; $Me = Zach from campfire stories (look it up)   *People keep asking, I am not him. Just read my lines in his voice.*
&gt; $CU = Clueless User  or some snooty art girl

&gt; $Me - Thanks for calling IT may I have your name please?  
&gt; $CU - Its Clueless User.  

I input her name into the thing and it pops up red indicating a VIP who expects to be given whatever she wants. She usually gets it too. 

&gt; $ME - So how may I help you today?  
&gt; $CU - So this will sound really weird and crazy, but I swear my wifi does not work right. Everywhere else I can work just fine, but as soon as I bring it home, it just stops working.  

Oh fun one of THESE calls. Probably an all metal house or an old as dirt house. 

&gt; $Me - So is it everywhere in your house?  
&gt; $CU - Yes... NO actually last night I worked while watching netflix on the tv in the living room and had zero issues.  
&gt; $Me - Well thats a good place to start. Lets go into your living room and test the wifi.  
&gt; $CU - Sure thing. 

We test the wifi in every room in her house and find that the signal degrades significantly the instant she steps into her room. 

&gt; $Me - OK this is going to sound like some James Bond scifi stuff but I bet something in your room is causing EM interference. Have you moved anything new into the room? I mean anything. A lamp, a microwave, coffee maker, mini fridge, or even non electronic stuff like metal?  
&gt; $CU - Who has a mini fridge in their room? (Laughs)  
&gt; $Me - I actually keep drinks in mine by my desk while I work.   
&gt; $CU - Oh. Well there is nothing like that. Plus the router is in the other room. Only thing over there are my art projects.  
&gt; $Me - OK. I am reaching WAY out there now. Is there a lot of metal content in that wall?  
&gt; $CU - No but there is a lot of metal on it.  
&gt; $Me - How so? You do metal work for your art?   
&gt; $CU - No I use it to hang my art.  
&gt; $Me - Its probably not it, but lets go ahead and send me a picture of it. I doubt that is whats causing it but might as well send me a picture.   

She takes the picture and sends it to me. In a roughly 6x8 foot section of her wall is a mounted chain link fence with these little cut up coke cans as art hanging off of it. It took me a full minute looking at the absurdity of the picture in front me when the light came on. 

&gt; $Me - Mam, that's a faraday cage. Well... sort of.   
&gt; $CU - What is a faraday cage.   

I hear from the background. ""I TOLD YOU!"" 

&gt; $CU - Ignore that, thats my son. We keep yelling at him to move the modem and router into our room but he says the fence is the problem.  
&gt; $Me - Well to be honest, it kinda is.  No its not kinda, it definitely is.  
&gt; $CU - Huh?  
&gt; $Me - So a faraday cage is what is used to block signals. Basically any linked metal cage can create a field where signals have trouble passing through.  
&gt; $CU - This is that James Bond crap you were talking about?  
&gt; $Me - I mean kinda? Its not a full faraday cage because its just 1 side. Its why your wifi works but constantly cuts out and stays at half strength. A faraday cage has to actually enclose something to properly shield it from radio and em waves. But that chain link fence is in direct line of sight with the router.  
&gt; $CU - I... don't see how that is possible. It makes no sense. But you, my husband, and my 16 year old son all say the same thing. They all say moving that to the garage will solve my problems.   
&gt; $Me - I agree with your assessment.  
&gt; $CU -  Are you willing to put your job on it? 

She had me stay on hold for 30 minutes as she got her husband and son to move the art and fence to the garage. 

&gt; $CU - Ok I am back. Pulling the ethernet cable... Huh that was fast. It instantly connected to the wifi.   
&gt; $Me - OK lets get connected again.   

Ran ping test with -t -l 1400 and had zero dropped pings. Before it was every 3rd one. Speed test gave her the full speed for her area. 

&gt; $CU - That was strange, well it is working now. How often you think this happens?     
&gt; $Me - I can legitimately state that I have never once run into this issue in my entire career.  
&gt; $CU - Seriously?  
&gt; $Me - Yup. Now I have run into weird things before.  
&gt; $CU - Like what?  
&gt; $ME - (All true stories.) In my parent's house, if you stand in the laundry room on wifi and I open both the fridge and freezer door in the kitchen, your phone will lose wifi connection. I had a friend who had to move his router 5 feet because a new lamp his mom loved was causing line of sight interference with his laptop. And my uncle decided to build an all metal house. Metal beams, metal roofing, and metal doors. He gets zero reception inside his house and has to run ethernet cables all over his home.   
&gt; $CU - So would running this ethernet cable through the wall be a better solution?  
&gt; $Me - Infinitely better. 

I thanked her and immediately shared the picture with everyone on my team. Only 3 had to be told what a faraday cage was. I am so proud of my team.",3710,0,1,"Mam, that's a faraday cage. This one happened to me today and I can not stop laughing at it.

And then they scattered.,"The year was 2012. I was working in mobile device sales at a large retailer. I also had a side gig doing freelance PC and home/consumer network support. One of my coworkers, a middle-aged man, caught wind of this and sought my assistance. 

Coworker: I just have the one computer at home and it has been turning off randomly. 
Me: As in, black screen, full shut down, no warning while doing ordinary stuff? 
Coworker: Yes - no specific program or anything that I’m running, happens at random. 
Me: Sounds like a hardware issue unfortunately but I’ll have a look at it. 

We agreed that he would bring the PC to the workplace since it was convenient for both of us. 

Typically I was doing this kind of work for upper-middle class suburbanites. In this instance, knowing roughly what my coworker was making, I offered to attempt a diagnosis and repair for free. I had spare parts around with minimal resale value. Unfortunately, no amount of payment could justify what I was to encounter...

Coworker: I brought the PC today, it’s in my car. 
Me: Ok, I’ll move it to my car.
(Go to coworker’s car - there is a thick black garbage bag in the back)
Coworker: the PC is in that bag. 
Me: Why is it in a bag? 
Coworker: I have a little roach problem and didn’t want to spread them in case any are inside.
Me: Ok, that makes sense. I’ll open it outdoors. 

I took the PC tower (still in the bag) home, put it at the end of my driveway, and cut the bag away. A couple roaches were indeed loose in the bag and scurried off. A couple more dead ones were in the bag with the tower.

Thinking the worst was over, I put the tower on its side and removed the side cover.

And then they all scattered. Hundreds. Tiny and medium sized roaches. Their exodus spread in a circle around the case like the shockwave of some organic explosion. I danced and jumped to avoid them. All escaped - except for the dead ones that had been shorting various components out and causing the black screens. They stayed behind and were delivered back to my coworker still in the case, in a fresh garbage bag, along with my recommendation to throw the whole thing away and buy some Raid for his home.",361,0,1,"And then they scattered.

Client's Complains of Sudden Internet Instability/Dropped Connections.,"I had a client who has been working from home since the COVID lockdowns began.  For the most part, her internet connection has been fine but for about a week, it kept dropping on her laptop.

Me: Are other members of your household having this problem?

Client: No. Just me.

Me: How far are you from the WiFi router?

Client: Usually, I'm right next to it as it is in my home office but I started letting my kids use the office for their classes and have been working from another room.

Me: Did you start having connection issues around the same time you made this switch?

Client: Why yes.  How did you know?

Me: It's likely that you are too far from the router for the signal to get to you.

Client: But that's impossible.  My husband bought and set up a repeater to boost signal.

Me: Where is the repeater?

Client: Right next to the router.

Me: (Face palm) Move the repeater to an area about halfway or so from the other room you are working in.  It can't extend the range of the signal if it's in the same room at the router.

Client moves repeater and viola....weak WiFi issues go away.

We don't do anything specific, we're simply in charge of all the technical stuff, from help desk to network management and installing hardware on the client side, mostly level 1 work.

Because of that we don't always have time to answer requests, and we ask them for a ticket while we work on more pressing matters. Users found a trick though - if they claim its urgent, we have to comply. It's just the rules.

Travel Agent Likes Her Mailbox Broken,"Disclaimers: English is my native language, but without Grammarly, I'm hopeless. This happened in 2007 so some of the little details are hazy. I've long moved out of Technical Support, but I supported hardware and software for years before moving into software testing.  


I worked for a virtual server company between 2006 and 2010 and I really loved the job most nights. We had a variety of products for different levels of users. There was something for everyone. Our smallest servers could handle 3-5 email accounts and a basic HTML website. Putting Wordpress on these was not a great idea. And we had beefy VPS that supported robust websites with shopping carts and 100s of users. They also had an enterprise side but we didn't deal with those. Our Dovecot installations were mbox by default, but we could always convert them to maildir if needed and we frequently did. I'm never quite sure why they decided to do it the way they did, but the company had been in business since the late 90s and was owned by a Japanese company by the time I got there.  


Anyway, I worked the midnight shift so I rarely got calls from US-based users that didn't know what they were doing. My customers were mostly Asian resellers and web developers.  One night, I got a call from a woman who ran a travel agency. She was irate that her email stopped working. Her mail client isn't accessing her mail anymore. Even webmail is choking. After double-checking her settings, I go into her directory and see a 1GB mbox file. I wasn't even sure how it had managed to work at all at that size.  I then politely explain that her mailbox file has gotten too large and that I had a couple of options. I could break apart the file into smaller parts and put the oldest emails up for her to backup if needed later. I could then convert the last two years of emails to maildir, thus restoring her email and preventing this from happening again. And I could show her how to configure her Outlook to use IMAP instead of POP.  (There was no way I could do the whole 1GB file, because there were so many emails that the mail system would choke on them all.)  


Oh boy, you'd swear that I suggested sacrificing a fluffy kitten on a high holiday. She didn't want to lose any emails for record-keeping. I explained that she wasn't going to lose them. She could download the file(s) and I could get her back up and running, but that it wasn't possible to just convert the whole file. She obviously knew nothing about computers outside of Microsoft Office and just wasn't hearing it. She was screaming, swearing, calling me stupid. I kept cool and tried desperately to give her workable options to get her up and running. Nope. She didn't want to me to touch her emails. Even when I find out 95% of them are just spam and she refused to delete them. I've never known someone more who wanted a magic wand and didn't want to get at least functioning while other options could be explored by higher-level techs. She ended up cussing me out one last time and hanging up. As there were only six of us on the shift, we all sat together, and calls were light, my coworkers heard the exchanged and for the next hour she got the same canned responses from my coworkers. She even asked for the supervisor and the only Tech II we had. When the day shift came in, we warned the supervisors about what had happened. I have no idea what eventually happened, I'd like to believe she returned to snail mail.",212,0,1,"Travel Agent Likes Her Mailbox Broken Disclaimers: English is my native language, but without Grammarly, I'm hopeless.

Oh boy, you'd swear that I suggested sacrificing a fluffy kitten on a high holiday. She didn't want to lose any emails for record-keeping. I explained that she wasn't going to lose them. She could download the file(s) and I could get her back up and running, but that it wasn't possible to just convert the whole file. She obviously knew nothing about computers outside of Microsoft Office and just wasn't hearing it. She was screaming, swearing, calling me stupid. I kept cool and tried desperately to give her workable options to get her up and running. Nope. She didn't want to me to touch her emails. Even when I find out 95% of them are just spam and she refused to delete them. I've never known someone more who wanted a magic wand and didn't want to get at least functioning while other options could be explored by higher-level techs. She ended up cussing me out one last time and hanging up. As there were only six of us on the shift, we all sat together, and calls were light, my coworkers heard the exchanged and for the next hour she got the same canned responses from my coworkers. She even asked for the supervisor and the only Tech II we had. When the day shift came in, we warned the supervisors about what had happened. I have no idea what eventually happened, I'd like to believe she returned to snail mail."

Just to be 100%,  I wont give you any names.

I work now for about 3 years in Customer Service. In this time, i worked for 3 Month as a Tech Support Agent for a huge streaming company.It was this classic "" did you try turning it off and on again "" typ of job. So yea, it was pretty easy.... But the customers.... oof.

I have so many storys from my time as customer service agent.  But this one especially gave me the biggest oof effect.

One day, a lady called claiming she has log in issuesShe used a smarttv and i thought she probably just had a  typo ( which is pretty common if using a remote )So I asked her:Me: ""Can you tell me what kind of message pops if you enter your login details ? ""Her: "" Yes, E-Mail is already taken ""I realized she must have clicked on register instead of log in ( fun fact: this too happens alot, mostly with older people )Me: "" Ok I see, you must have clicked on the wrong button, just go a few steps back to see the main menu again ""In order to help the customer as good as possible, we had guides of each possible device. So I knew she had to go like 3 steps backMe: "" Go back ""Her: "" yes ""Me: ""Again one step""Her ""ok""Me"" And go back again""Her:"" i cant""Me: "" why ? did you receive somekind of error message ? ""Her: "" no, but i am already at wall of my room, I cant go further ""It took me about 30 seconds to realize that she literally moved back from the tv.

Thank god this is over. Dont get me wrong, the job WAS pretty easy but I had calls like this on a daily basis. 45 mins calls explaining an old lady how to reset her passwort or explaining a guy why he cant get a refund for a missing day after he locked his account.

"User forgot to log off after she went into the homeoffice mode because ""that's what the others told me""","This is a fresh one.

So, this user called our service desk. Four times today, I was the fifth one. Basically, the Outlook was prompting the password, the user typed it in but it didn't go further. I looked through the today's tickets to see what my colleagues did. One of them reset the password because it expired. And from then, the problems with Outlook happened. The reason for this was a locked GROUP\ account in all of the tickets before. So I unlocked it and asked the user to try again. Ten minutes later, the GROUP\ account got locked again – by itself.

Strange I thought. So I asked our second level if they have some time and if they could check what's happening with the automatic lockouts. A few minutes later, I got an answer with the screenshot that there were several lockouts today and for all of them, the reason was another computer. I looked that computer up and it was a desktop PC belonging to the user.

So I asked the user for more info. They told me they work from home (and 95 % of the users work on Citrix remote desktops). Aaaand just to confirm what our 2nd level told me, I asked if the user was logged before. They told me that when they left work to go into the homeoffice mode, they just (I cite word by word) ""lock the screen because that's what the others told me"". There. Just there, I facepalmed really hard. Of course, the office desktop was logged under the old password which was continously blocking the GROUP\ account after the today's pwd change.

Can you turn our smart boards into a 20 foot monitor?,"A fun one from about 9-10 years ago. The business I worked for not only did office equipment repair we also offered a variety of tech solutions. One of the tech solutions I loved was Sharp brand interactive smart boards, aka a huge ass touch pad TV/monitor. We sold a couple of these to schools and various businesses, one such business was an investment broker who had a nice mid-large sized office that included two conference rooms and a training room. They ended up getting three 80 inch smart boards, one for each of the conference rooms and one for the training room, and a nice surround sound system with wireless mics for the training room.

The owner’s son (Who I’ll refer to as J) was their resident tech for basic computer stuff and also worked on the investment end of things. Over the course of setting everything up and testing/instructing on the new “toys” he and I got to talking about tech, gaming, etc. and we end up talking about how cool it would be to use the displays for gaming. I mentioned that they could get upgrade kits for the displays that would make them mobile stand-alone stations that didn’t need a dedicated desktop hooked up and would allow them to put all of them in the conference room if they needed more than one screen and could be set as clone displays.

I could see the wheels turning in his head and he said he’d talk to his dad about getting the upgrades. Cut to two days later and my boss is asking me to order the upgrade kits for all the displays. These kits included hydraulic legs on nice wheels so you could adjust the height and move the system with ease. It also had a dedicated PC mounted to the stand to run the touch displays. After about two weeks I went over and setup the new kits and showed the added functions. After going over everything and his father had left the room J questioned me about auxiliary input on the displays and how to setup multiple displays using a single system, I explain how to do it if his video card supports multiple displays. J then shows me a freshly built gaming rig he had in his office, I’m sure you all know where this is going, that had a very nice video card for the time with multiple displays outputs. I show him how to set it up after hooking everything up and give him my cell number in case he has questions for his after hour’s hobby.

Two weeks later I get a call on Friday night from J saying he’s running the multiple displays but can’t get the resolutions to look right across all three screens, two look ok but the third throws everything off. I’m intrigued and also very curious to see this monster setup so I drive over, only a thirty minute drive, and take a look at everything. I have to say three 80” displays side by side hooked up to a gaming rig looks AWESOME. After some tinkering in the settings and playing with the available resolutions I come to the conclusion that due to the sheer size of everything that we’d have to use a wide screen resolution that didn’t quite go corner to corner but still maintained a proper ratio for display. J is a little bummed and asks if there is anything I can think of because he wants to game on all 3 displays on the weekends and also wanted run cable through the setup to watch football. I told him I’d do some research and get back to him.

I poured over a ton of different video controllers and display setup information, I was a man on a mission I wanted this to work so much my inner geek was having a meltdown. After hunting all weekend I finally came across a series of controllers made by Sharp that is designed to be used for wall display setups ranging from 2 up to 24 screens. It could be set to auto adjust the output depending on what resolution you wanted and how many displays you want to use. I gave J a call and told him I found a solution but it was a bit expensive, He said he’d talk to his dad and see about getting him to foot the bill so they could watch football on the setup, his dad was a huge college football fan and J was using that as a selling point to get him to sign off on it.

The next day we got a go ahead to get the controller and get it set up. After it came in I went over and installed it in the training room with J chomping at the bit to try it out. His dad also poked his head in once or twice to see if we had it running yet, pretty sure he was just as excited as J but was trying not to act like a little kid at Christmas. After some tinkering I had it set and it looked good on the PC, then we connected to cable box. Had to do some tweaks again but got it looking real good. Almost a complete fill across the displays and it looked amazing. Being the geek I am I also brought the necessary connectors to hook up the audio to the surround sound system in the room. We did a quick test at low volume and then looked up a touchdown run on the YouTube and proceeded to crank to volume almost to max, it sounded like a stadium. His dad jumps in the room with a huge grin on his face and proceeds to stand in awe of the glorious triple wide display running football footage and hearing it through the surround sound system (he didn’t know I planned on hooking it up to do that), after the clip he proceeds to *yell* at us to turn it down all the while still grinning ear to ear.

In total for all the displays, hardware, setup, and extras it cost roughly $12k for a very nice business system that doubled as a killer entertainment system. They definitely got their money’s worth as J sent me a few photos of them on the weekends after hours with their big comfy office chairs in the training room with the table’s setup with a tailgate buffet and coolers as foot rests. He also sent me a couple shots of him gaming, a couple racing games (which looked insane) and some shots of him playing WoW.

The same old customers,"Way back 2013 or 2014 I used to work  as a customer support rep for roku(this was just the start of the internet tv box) before android TVs and such, I had a lot of customers call in and be d×cks from the get go but most were senior citizens who did'nt even know they needed a password to connect to their wifi so you had to walk them through getting the password and typing it on the screen

"So, I took out our 802.1x authentication servers by mistake","PSA: double and triple and quadruple check your code. Scratch that, just copy paste lines that work and edit info to create new lines!

I don't post much, but I figured you guys would appreciate this.  I am a sysadmin for a medium sized manufacturing company.  We are a 3 person IT team, so we try to automate as much as possible.  One of the automations we use is Puppet for server configuration.

Anyway, we have 802.1x set up so only computers with domain accounts can get an IP address.  One of the ways to bypass that to allow networked printers is to use a Mac Address Bypass configuration file with Puppet to push devices we want to allow to the Radius server.  We rarely get new network printers since most of our multi-function copiers are leased.

Last week we got a new copier in and I forgot the tech was coming to install and remove the old one.  I am hurriedly trying to get the new copier authenticated in DHCP because the old one was already removed and an entire department was down.  I had my laptop in the room with the copier when I realized DUH, I hadn't added the MAC to the mac address bypass configuration.  Normally when I do this I copy the last line, paste it into notepad, change the MAC info, then copy and paste back into the Puppet config file.  This time I decided to write a new line manually because I hate copy and paste using a touchpad.  

So here I am, just created the new MAC entry in the bypass list, and am twiddling my thumbs and swearing because the printer still will not get a valid IP and is continually sitting there with a private IP.  I think to myself, OK, it is a new copier and maybe there is a setting inside that needs to be changed.  As the tech and I are poking around in the printer, my phone starts buzzing.  Someone can't log into a conference room PC.  That's fine, they usually can't remember a password or use the wrong syntax the first time they enter a username.  I leave and go check it out.  The computer will not authenticate on the network.  Well crap, looks like it lost it's authentication settings from GP.  I take it back to my test bench to re-sync the GP and re-add it to the 802.1x authentication group.  Take it back, and same issue.  OK, let's try another conference room PC, maybe this one is just having a case of the Mondays (on Thursday LOL).  Same issue with the other PC.

Then my phone starts buzzing repeatedly with people not able to log into their computers or access the network if they do.  Poke around in syslog, well crap.  802.1x authentication is failing across the board.  At this point network connection is completely gone for around 2/3 of the company.  Something seems to have hosed our primary RADIUS server.  Oh look, the fail-over has errors out the wazoo too. As well as the third and final auth server.  

WTF.  Maybe the patches last week?  Maybe it didn't reboot cleanly and just decided to quit?

No.  Finally something clicks and I decide to check the MAC address bypass config again.  Everything seems to be fine, the format is all the same until.... BOOM.  I see it.  A semi-colon where a colon should be.  In the single line of code I added.  That can't possibly be the cause, can it?  It is one line of code in a MAC address bypass config.  That can't possibly affect all of our RADIUS servers.  

WRONG.  It did.  And when Puppet pushed the new config to the RADIUS servers, they went down and stopped authenticating one by one.  A silly semi-colon just staring me in the face and giving me the finger.  Needless to say I promptly ended it's existence and replaced the bugger with a glorious colon, pushed the config to Puppet, and all the RADIUS servers were once again happy and authenticating as they should.

TL;DR:  Watch those colons people, they're IMPORTANT!"
DotNet shenanigans,"Background: this was a huge worldwide company, industry leader in the field, and it was basically 100% dependent on IT.

There was upon a time, fairly recent, a top company that had 10! CTOs in the span of 4 years. (None got fired).

And this marvelous company, fully dependent on IT specialists and programmers decided to outsource everything and not even keep a skeleton crew on board.

This is where my dumbass comes in. Some middle management smart guys got together and decided that they actually need and IT department, so they hired specialists and programmers under different departments. This should've been a red flag but I took it as an opportunity.

Now back to our story: there was an old ancient cluster of servers dating back to when humanity first discovered binary. It was unmaintained for well over a year. Why you ask? Because all outsourcing was done for desktops and laptops, not one clause specified servers.

So this ancient beast served well over 1000 people and secured their livelihood. 
I take a look into the abyss, and boy do I get a chill on my back. I ask:

""Erm, is there a replacement and migration plan and a new cluster on the way?

""Of course not, why would there be one?

""Was there a replacement plan before the it apocalypse?""

""Well yea, but it was too expensive and it got shelved, we bought all these new laptops instead""

Okay, my alarm starts going off, I need to save that poor cluster before it dies.

6 horrific months later, the replacement is approved and finally we can move up from server 2003(Tm).

The outsorced company receive instructions to take care of the new cluster, and we have to work in tandem for a veeery fast migration.

The first and most important in the order of business is to migrate the main database and push it on live, along with about 10 of the 300 clients.

I make my case, strongly, very strongly: ""migrate smaller clients in the first batch, in case of problems when can quickly fallback and save everything"".

You can guess what management decided: migrate the largest, most important clients first. 

""Oh boy, can we at least do them on our terms?""

""No, the outsorcing company will take care of them""

Needless to say, it was such a clusterfuck that not even one of the clients was migrated successfully.

Anyway, we passed that moment, the server was live for 2 weeks, some 50 clients now enjoyed it, about 40% of the load, and the rest would follow soon. Hell, even some new and important clients were on it.

When the new cluster was approved there was a very important document drafted by some IT guru, and it said that the main database server should be configured such as the database could not be stopped by anything else than human input. This meant that any command to the server that stops the server will be ignored, be it a windows update, software installation, software update, etc. So that they would never influence the uptime.

The only way to stop the server was to first stop the database service.

A second file contained details and policies on how, and especially when such operations could be performed.

So here is me, Monday morning, chilling, when I get informed that the server is down.
Console is outsorced, so I try to rdp in: the server is up but I get disconnected, I try again, and again, and again, until an error pops up stating that the rdp service is not responding.

I take all the info from that error and start a frenzy trying to find out a cause.
Everything points out to a .NET framework update.

Basically the server is telling everyone and everything that it wants a restart.

I hurry along and get this info to the company that does the outsorcing, I inform everyone that the server is stuck on a .net issue and needs a hard restart.

Turns out that the outsorcing company decided to perform a .net update with the database running, because they weren't allowed to stop it. This caused every other service on the server to stop, except for the one that it could not stop.

It took 6 more hours to get the other company to restart the server.

Edit: the update should've been planned by them and approved by us. They should've also respected the steps agreed in the procedure, but they just ignored everything and pushed the update.",237,0,1,"DotNet shenanigans Background: this was a huge worldwide company, industry leader in the field, and it was basically 100% dependent on IT.

There was upon a time, fairly recent, a top company that had 10! CTOs in the span of 4 years. (None got fired).

And this marvelous company, fully dependent on IT specialists and programmers decided to outsource everything and not even keep a skeleton crew on board.

This is where my dumbass comes in. Some middle management smart guys got together and decided that they actually need and IT department, so they hired specialists and programmers under different departments. This should've been a red flag but I took it as an opportunity.

Now back to our story: there was an old ancient cluster of servers dating back to when humanity first discovered binary. It was unmaintained for well over a year. Why you ask? Because all outsourcing was done for desktops and laptops, not one clause specified servers.

So this ancient beast served well over 1000 people and secured their livelihood. 
I take a look into the abyss, and boy do I get a chill on my back. I ask:

""Erm, is there a replacement and migration plan and a new cluster on the way?

""Of course not, why would there be one?

Wholesome story ( During covid season),"So I am new to tech support and I don't have many stories, but this one just happened a few minutes ago.

I don't understand. It was running fine and then I happened.,"I work in a very specific industry so I will remain vague about a lot of product details.  80% of the work is troubleshooting over the phone with our dealers located all over the country.  The other 20% is showing up in person to an emergency where we explain the chain of command to the inanimate machine refusing to work.  That is we get a chain and beat the machine with it until the it understands who is in command and starts working again.

My coworkers were some of the most excellent people I have ever had the pleasure of working with.  There was the old timer whose employee number was a single digit and had likely broken more things over the course of his career than I will ever fix.  There was Deadpool, a semi chaotic super genius who engineering wouldn't let look at the source code because he might get ideas.  There was the boss man who inspired confidence in everyone because he did the same work as us and had been around long enough to have a double digit employee number.  There was Captain America who looked exactly like Steve Rodgers and could have been a male model if he could stomach dealing with useless people.  Instead he worked with us and used a mix of mind reading and Fonzie style juke box banging to resurrect every machine from the dead.  Lastly there was the guy from El Salvador who spoke excellent english, but had a bad ear for accents so I would have to sometimes translate southern english to regular english for him.  We'll call him the Swede.  Since I want a cool name too, I'll call myself. . . Myself.  

So no shit, there I was 2 weeks after getting hired, trying to figure out if I'm holding one of the the manuals upside down or maybe sideways when the old timer comes over to my desk.  

Old Timer:  The neighbor called and can't get his machine to run.  He wants one of us to sneak away from the phone and fix it for him.  Why don't you take the intern over there and show him how to remote start it and check the error codes.  Take my truck.  Tools are in the back.  

Boss Man:  Don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  

Deadpool:  One of us will come collect your bodies in about half an hour.

The intern and I drive half a mile to meet the neighbor and get some details on why the machine won't run.  

Neighbor:  I don't understand what happened.  It was running fine this morning and now the motors won't move more than a few inches.  I don't know if we fried a sensor or maybe lost VFD communication.  He keeps coming back to how it worked earlier and he can't understand what went wrong.

He couldn't think of any more important information (this is important for later), so I proceeded to show the intern how to start the machine remotely without incurring maiming, injury, explosions or anything else fun.  There were no error codes but the tension compression switch had killed the machine.  I grabbed a wrench and showed him how to manually let the tension off.  Then we started the maching again.  The motors revved up and got faster and faster before there was a loud unsettling CLANG and it shut down in tension again.  

Since it only made scary noises and nothing actually broke, we decided to do this 3 or 4 more times to see if we could learn anything new.  And we did.  The controls and sensors were all working perfectly.  Unfortunately sensors are only as good as the inputs they are given and we noticed two motors that would always spin the opposite direction from the others.  The sensors would see tension build and have the VFD increase the frequency of the offending motors to make them catch up to the others.  Unfortunately this just makes the problem worse when the motor isn't even spinning the right way.  

I gave the intern a quick lesson on changing direction for 3-phase motors which involves swapping some wires.  We hit the go button and waited for the start up sequence to reach the spinning motor section.  While we were waiting, Captain America arrived to see if we were still alive and or collect whatever remained if we somehow came into contact with 480 volts worth of angry pixies.  The machine started running like a dream.  Captain america went on his way and I went over to talk to the neighbor.  

Myself:  We fixed it but I don't understand how it was even working earlier.  We had to actually move some wires to get all the motors spinning the same direction.  

Neighbor:  When I said it was running earlier, I meant before we took it apart, replaced the spindles, and wired the motors back up to it.  

Myself:  OK.  Bye.  (Screamimg internally)  

Back at the office I told my story to the team and they didn't seem surprised at all.

School district saves a couple $ and almost costs me my sanity.,"This story involves the same school district I mentioned in a previous post. Amazingly enough it wasn’t the elementary school who had issues this day, no this time it was the high school’s turn to challenge my sanity and patience.

We got a call saying that the main copier in the high school was having intermittent jamming issues. Lucky me! Being the only tech available I get on the road to see what issue was causing headaches for my favorite group of ladies at the high school. I get on site and take a look at the reports, nothing to major just random jams out of tray one. I pop out the feed unit and replace the rollers, slap it back in the machine, fire some test copies through the machine, write up my paperwork and call it a day. Cut to the next day and again, high school is having jam issues… what the hell???

On site again and again the machine report lists random jams out of tray 1…

*Ok machine, time to fix you for good.*

I swap feed units with another tray and run some test, no jams in tray 1. Ok now let’s check the unit I swapped and… no jams… o.O? Ok, maybe it’s a timing clutch being prissy, so I change the clutch on the original feed unit and put it back in tray 1, again run test prints through the machine, write up my paperwork and head out. Cut to the next day and AGAIN the high school is having jam issues.

*Ok machine… NOW it’s personal -.-*

I grab drive motors, complete feed units, a variety of feed timing clutches for the various sections, sensors, and drive belts for the multiple sections that have them all from a machine in the shop that I know works fine (it’s one I had refurbished for resale and we had been using it for months as our spare printer).

When in doubt *SHOTGUN* the problem, aka replace everything you can think of related to the issue at hand and then figure it out later in the shop. Again I get on site swap out all the parts I had brought with me. I asked the office ladies for anything and everything I could get my hands on to run test prints/copies I ran over 10 reams of paper (5000+ sheets of paper) through that machine and not a jam. *Finally VICTORY!!!!* Write up my paperwork specifically noting the amount of testing I had done and called it a day.

That’s the end, no more issues were had and I could stop worrying about that account for a while is what I REALLY want to tell you dear readers but alas…. NO I cannot say that.

The next day AGAIN they call in and say it’s having jams.

*NO!!! HEAD DESK! HEAD DESK! HEAD DESK! While quietly sobbing internally. Why tech gods, why have you forsaken me???*

My boss is not happy, this is day 4 of the same issue and the third recall for the same thing. I get on the phone and tell the ladies at the school to not touch the machine, leave it as it is, TOUCH NOTHING!!! At this point I am stumped, the ONLY thing I haven’t replaced is the tray itself. So I pulled the tray our of our office machine, grabbed my tools and what remained of my sanity and headed to the school figuring I’d be on hold with dealer support trying to figure this out for the next couple of hours.

I get on site, pull out tray one, toss it on the table, and slap the other tray in place. I fill it full of paper and again ask for anything I could make copies/prints of. Again no jams… I’m at a total loss there’s no way it was the tray causing the issues, I had used said tray the three days prior and ran a case of paper out of it What the hell is going on here?!?! Feeling utterly hopeless I take a 5 minute break and just put my head down on the desk looking at the tray sitting beside me.

I need to note that tray 1 on this particular model of machine was a large capacity tray, designed to hold 3 reams of paper at a time to help cut down on the need to refill the tray all the time.

*The layout of the paper in tray 1 is what's know as Letter where its sitting 11"" top to bottom and 8 1/2"" side to side. There's another layout know as Letter R(Letter Rotate) where the paper is in the machine 8 1/2"" top to bottom and 11"" side to side this is important later*

*blink blink* What the hell???

Looking at the paper sitting in the tray from the side… What the HELL???

I immediately take a VERY close look at the paper I left in the tray, there was about a ream of slightly poorer quality paper sitting on top of the normal nice bright white paper that I was getting from the cases of paper in the office. This duller paper also has a very small repeating gap along both edges of the stack (side to side the 8 1/2"" side) if you look at it from the side. Top to bottom on the 11"" side there was no such gaps. I rifle down through the paper and discover that about every 15 sheets there is one sheet that is about a cm shorter than the others. I pull the paper and ask the ladies in the office where this paper came from. 


M: our just short of clinically insane technician
S: Secretary
P: Dic... I mean the principal of the school and board member.


S: Oh that’s the teachers stock, they use paper out of that closet. *pointing to a closed closet behind them* 


M: Teacher’s stock???


S: Yeah, the Principal got a good deal on cheaper paper for the teachers to use for classes. We use the stuff stacked by the copier for everything else in administration.


M: May I?


S: Sure


I pull out a fresh ream of the teacher’s paper, take off the outer wrapper and proceed to look down the outer edges of the ream and sure enough the exact same repeating gaps along the edges. AHH HA!!! I proceed to fan through the paper and pull out the ONE short sheet every fifteen or so pages, stick it in the copier and no jams for an entire ream. I then put a “fresh” ream of teachers stock in the machine and start getting jams as soon as the copier runs a couple of the shorter sheets. FINALLY!!! *angelic voices sounding victory in my head*

I asked the secretary if the jams only occurred when teachers were making copies.


S: Now that you mention it I think so.


M: Why is this the first time I've seen this paper?


S: Oh, we knew you'd run test like always with our stuff so we took it out and put it away.


*Eye twitching* M: That's so thoughtful, I'm guessing you left it in today because I said dont touch anything?


S: Yeah, ""insert secretary 2's name"" was going to take it out but I told her you said dont touch anything.


I honestly did the following: I walked over, calmly clasped her hand in both of mine, looked her dead in the eyes *cue romantic background music* and in a soft voice I said ""Thank You!""


S: *taken a bit back by my reaction* Um, what?


I proceed to show her that the cheaper paper had occasionally shorter sheets in the stacks and explained that that tiny bit of difference in length was causing timing issues and said If secretary 2 had taken the paper out I may not have found the issue at all.

At this point the principal had come out and started huffing and puffing about how this is unacceptable and we're never using your company again even if we're the lowest bidders on the service contract. These machines are junk we're always having problems, etc.


M: Sir, I finally have the issue resolved. I know exactly what has been causing the problems. Turns out it was the cheaper paper the teachers were using.


P: Oh that's a load, there's nothing wrong with that paper. I got it at a discount from our supplier.


M: There's a reason it was probably discounted.


I proceed to show him the sheets that are cut shorter than the rest of the stack and explain that even though minor it's enough to cause timing issues in a machine running at high speeds.


P: *Scoff* Theres now way that's causing the issue!


M: Ok! I can prove it. I'll take a ream of the cheap stuff, pull out all the short sheets and run the entire thing with no jams. Then I'll try one as is and it won't get 50 sheets without a jam.


At this point this was either going to work or I was going to say F it and let my boss deal with this guy. I was done dealing with this nightmare, especially since I finally had it figured out and knew exactly what the issue was.

Folks, you'll never guess what happened. It did exactly what I said. Fixed ream has zero issues, the ""as is"" ream was jam central. *Shocker*


P: So you're saying we have several pallets of paper we can't use in the machines without having to manually go through and remove the short paper. How am I going to explain that to everyone? No! I need this to work no matter what.


Pretty sure he didn't want to tell his teachers they'd have to waste time pulling paper or explain to the board why said teachers were wasting time pulling paper.


M: its actually not that big of an issue. You'll just have tell the teachers to only use tray 2 for their paper.


Tray 2 on the machine was setup as Letter R, as mentioned above. Because the paper was short on the 8 1/2"" side running it out of tray 2 would mean the unaltered 11"" edge would be used for timing and would cause no issues. If you were copying/printing to the very edge it would cut off a bit but for their purposes it worked perfectly fine.

My solution was simply keep tray 2 stocked with only the teachers paper and when the teachers needed to make copies simply pull tray 1 out about an inch to force the copier to use tray 2, being a digital copier it would automatically rotate the image and do its job normally.


P: Really? That's all we have to do?

M: Yes.


I then explained what I typed above and that it would work with no issues as long as they only use the paper in the Letter R trays.


P: Well ok, you're sure it will work fine.


*REALLY DUDE!* 


M: Absolutely! Here I'll run an entire ream from tray 2 and it won't jam.


Proceed to do the above without a jam. *BOOM Mic drop bitch! Honestly if it had jammed I would have just packed up and said I quit! send someone else to deal with this shit.*


P: Ok then, this will work.


M: *No shit Sherlock internal monologue * Yes, now you may still have the occasional jam if the feed rollers wear out but they last for about 150k sheets so you shouldn't see me for a while.


*Yes in hindsight I should of just shut up and left, but my scrambled brain was in CYA mode*


P: I'll hold you too that! Laughing


*Shit*

P: Sure, just make sure you comp me the prints.


*you cheap ass.....*


M: I'll let the boss know that's what you want.


I FINALLY make it out of there and get back to the shop. I then proceeded to explain what the hell happened to my boss and do a quick show and tell.


M: the tech guy who's sanity at this point is barley being held together by chewing gum.
B: Boss


B: Well that's a new one for the books.


M: Yeah... Oh by the way the principal wanted comped for the paper on his contract bill.


B: Sure thing, with all the test prints you made figuring this out it covers the cost. It was all stuff they needed and kept right?


M: Absolutely, you know I hate wasting paper doing tests so I ran nothing but stuff they'd keep/use.


I need to note that service contracts were set on a cost per copy basis where you had so many copies a month and me running  all those prints put them over their monthly limit so they'd be getting an extra charge that month. If we ran garbage prints we had to keep track to deduct it from customers totals. I was notorious for only doing about 25 junk prints when testing a machines and always asking for things customers needed prints copies of.

May my fellow techs have a great, calm, stress free day. Sadly if you're working, especially with remote users, that's probably not going to happen.",2050,0,1,"School district saves a couple $ and almost costs me my sanity. This story involves the same school district I mentioned in a previous post. Amazingly enough it wasn’t the elementary school who had issues this day, no this time it was the high school’s turn to challenge my sanity and patience.

We got a call saying that the main copier in the high school was having intermittent jamming issues. Lucky me! Being the only tech available I get on the road to see what issue was causing headaches for my favorite group of ladies at the high school. I get on site and take a look at the reports, nothing to major just random jams out of tray one. I pop out the feed unit and replace the rollers, slap it back in the machine, fire some test copies through the machine, write up my paperwork and call it a day. Cut to the next day and again, high school is having jam issues… what the hell???

On site again and again the machine report lists random jams out of tray 1…

*Ok machine, time to fix you for good.*

I swap feed units with another tray and run some test, no jams in tray 1. Ok now let’s check the unit I swapped and… no jams… o.O? Ok, maybe it’s a timing clutch being prissy, so I change the clutch on the original feed unit and put it back in tray 1, again run test prints through the machine, write up my paperwork and head out. Cut to the next day and AGAIN the high school is having jam issues.

*Ok machine… NOW it’s personal -.-*

I grab drive motors, complete feed units, a variety of feed timing clutches for the various sections, sensors, and drive belts for the multiple sections that have them all from a machine in the shop that I know works fine (it’s one I had refurbished for resale and we had been using it for months as our spare printer).

When in doubt *SHOTGUN* the problem, aka replace everything you can think of related to the issue at hand and then figure it out later in the shop. Again I get on site swap out all the parts I had brought with me. I asked the office ladies for anything and everything I could get my hands on to run test prints/copies I ran over 10 reams of paper (5000+ sheets of paper) through that machine and not a jam. *Finally VICTORY!!!!* Write up my paperwork specifically noting the amount of testing I had done and called it a day.

That’s the end, no more issues were had and I could stop worrying about that account for a while is what I REALLY want to tell you dear readers but alas…. NO I cannot say that.

The next day AGAIN they call in and say it’s having jams.

*NO!!! HEAD DESK! HEAD DESK! HEAD DESK! While quietly sobbing internally. Why tech gods, why have you forsaken me???*

My boss is not happy, this is day 4 of the same issue and the third recall for the same thing. I get on the phone and tell the ladies at the school to not touch the machine, leave it as it is, TOUCH NOTHING!!! At this point I am stumped, the ONLY thing I haven’t replaced is the tray itself. So I pulled the tray our of our office machine, grabbed my tools and what remained of my sanity and headed to the school figuring I’d be on hold with dealer support trying to figure this out for the next couple of hours.

I get on site, pull out tray one, toss it on the table, and slap the other tray in place. I fill it full of paper and again ask for anything I could make copies/prints of. Again no jams… I’m at a total loss there’s no way it was the tray causing the issues, I had used said tray the three days prior and ran a case of paper out of it What the hell is going on here?!?! Feeling utterly hopeless I take a 5 minute break and just put my head down on the desk looking at the tray sitting beside me.

I need to note that tray 1 on this particular model of machine was a large capacity tray, designed to hold 3 reams of paper at a time to help cut down on the need to refill the tray all the time.

*The layout of the paper in tray 1 is what's know as Letter where its sitting 11"" top to bottom and 8 1/2"" side to side. There's another layout know as Letter R(Letter Rotate) where the paper is in the machine 8 1/2"" top to bottom and 11"" side to side this is important later*

*blink blink* What the hell???

Looking at the paper sitting in the tray from the side… What the HELL???

I immediately take a VERY close look at the paper I left in the tray, there was about a ream of slightly poorer quality paper sitting on top of the normal nice bright white paper that I was getting from the cases of paper in the office. This duller paper also has a very small repeating gap along both edges of the stack (side to side the 8 1/2"" side) if you look at it from the side. Top to bottom on the 11"" side there was no such gaps. I rifle down through the paper and discover that about every 15 sheets there is one sheet that is about a cm shorter than the others. I pull the paper and ask the ladies in the office where this paper came from. 


M: our just short of clinically insane technician
S: Secretary
P: Dic... I mean the principal of the school and board member.


S: Oh that’s the teachers stock, they use paper out of that closet. *pointing to a closed closet behind them* 


M: Teacher’s stock???


S: Yeah, the Principal got a good deal on cheaper paper for the teachers to use for classes. We use the stuff stacked by the copier for everything else in administration.


M: May I?


S: Sure


I pull out a fresh ream of the teacher’s paper, take off the outer wrapper and proceed to look down the outer edges of the ream and sure enough the exact same repeating gaps along the edges. AHH HA!!! I proceed to fan through the paper and pull out the ONE short sheet every fifteen or so pages, stick it in the copier and no jams for an entire ream. I then put a “fresh” ream of teachers stock in the machine and start getting jams as soon as the copier runs a couple of the shorter sheets. FINALLY!!! *angelic voices sounding victory in my head*

I asked the secretary if the jams only occurred when teachers were making copies.


S: Now that you mention it I think so.


M: Why is this the first time I've seen this paper?


S: Oh, we knew you'd run test like always with our stuff so we took it out and put it away.


*Eye twitching* M: That's so thoughtful, I'm guessing you left it in today because I said dont touch anything?


S: Yeah, ""insert secretary 2's name"" was going to take it out but I told her you said dont touch anything.


I honestly did the following: I walked over, calmly clasped her hand in both of mine, looked her dead in the eyes *cue romantic background music* and in a soft voice I said ""Thank You!""


S: *taken a bit back by my reaction* Um, what?


I proceed to show her that the cheaper paper had occasionally shorter sheets in the stacks and explained that that tiny bit of difference in length was causing timing issues and said If secretary 2 had taken the paper out I may not have found the issue at all.

At this point the principal had come out and started huffing and puffing about how this is unacceptable and we're never using your company again even if we're the lowest bidders on the service contract. These machines are junk we're always having problems, etc.


M: Sir, I finally have the issue resolved. I know exactly what has been causing the problems. Turns out it was the cheaper paper the teachers were using.


P: Oh that's a load, there's nothing wrong with that paper. I got it at a discount from our supplier.


M: There's a reason it was probably discounted.


I proceed to show him the sheets that are cut shorter than the rest of the stack and explain that even though minor it's enough to cause timing issues in a machine running at high speeds.


P: *Scoff* Theres now way that's causing the issue!


M: Ok! I can prove it. I'll take a ream of the cheap stuff, pull out all the short sheets and run the entire thing with no jams. Then I'll try one as is and it won't get 50 sheets without a jam.


At this point this was either going to work or I was going to say F it and let my boss deal with this guy. I was done dealing with this nightmare, especially since I finally had it figured out and knew exactly what the issue was.

Folks, you'll never guess what happened. It did exactly what I said. Fixed ream has zero issues, the ""as is"" ream was jam central. *Shocker*


P: So you're saying we have several pallets of paper we can't use in the machines without having to manually go through and remove the short paper. How am I going to explain that to everyone? No! I need this to work no matter what.


Pretty sure he didn't want to tell his teachers they'd have to waste time pulling paper or explain to the board why said teachers were wasting time pulling paper.


M: its actually not that big of an issue. You'll just have tell the teachers to only use tray 2 for their paper.


Tray 2 on the machine was setup as Letter R, as mentioned above. Because the paper was short on the 8 1/2"" side running it out of tray 2 would mean the unaltered 11"" edge would be used for timing and would cause no issues. If you were copying/printing to the very edge it would cut off a bit but for their purposes it worked perfectly fine.

My solution was simply keep tray 2 stocked with only the teachers paper and when the teachers needed to make copies simply pull tray 1 out about an inch to force the copier to use tray 2, being a digital copier it would automatically rotate the image and do its job normally.


P: Really? That's all we have to do?

M: Yes.


I then explained what I typed above and that it would work with no issues as long as they only use the paper in the Letter R trays.


P: Well ok, you're sure it will work fine.


*REALLY DUDE!* 


M: Absolutely! Here I'll run an entire ream from tray 2 and it won't jam.


Proceed to do the above without a jam. *BOOM Mic drop bitch! Honestly if it had jammed I would have just packed up and said I quit! send someone else to deal with this shit.*


P: Ok then, this will work.


M: *No shit Sherlock internal monologue * Yes, now you may still have the occasional jam if the feed rollers wear out but they last for about 150k sheets so you shouldn't see me for a while.


*Yes in hindsight I should of just shut up and left, but my scrambled brain was in CYA mode*


P: I'll hold you too that! Laughing


*Shit*


M: Do you mind if I take some of the paper with me to show my boss, since this was such an odd problem?  *again CYA mode*


P: Sure, just make sure you comp me the prints.

New monitor deployment and the ensuing fights over empty boxes,"I actually enjoy this story, its pretty wholesome compared to the other shenanigans you read about on this sub.

I am in the middle of deploying 70+ new monitors for exsisting desktops and recycling (taking out back and recreating 'Office Space') the old 4:3 that somehow we were still using.

These monitors are coming in, what I have been told, are very nice boxes that are very useful for storing crafts or other items. Most of the women that work in this office are older (think very nice grandmothers) and they have been ""fighting"" over the empty boxes as they want to take them all home. Since we have so many of them, there is plenty to go around.

We have finally come to an agreement that there will be a rotation on who gets the next boxes (I am the only one doing the deployment so it takes some time between this and my other daily duties) and they are all lined up to get as many as they can take.

Videowall cost cuts,"This is a continuation of my previous posts, especially ""check where you pay for your software"".

This post will address some questions from the comments and hopefully leave you more bewildered.

One sunny day in hell some spawn of Satan decided that people should be able to see a TV screen from space. Thus the videowall was born. There are many variations on the concept but it's basically a huge TV screen.
Now the most modern take on it in the mid 2010s were fullhd plasmas 3-6-9-12, the sky is the limit, all connected to a proprietary device.(a very expensive one)

Now techs were, at that time, obsessed over a cute little kitten called raspberry. And they had so many dreams and plans with it that they considered it a solution to every problem. Someone even made a server with those puppies.

Anyway, in our story, some smart guy decided that a videowall could work very well with an rpi and some basic splitters. This basically cut the proprietary device out and cut the cost tenfold. Good job.

Now back to our little story. We had a few of these things at first, and apparently clients loved them, they loved them so much in fact that we had to install as many as we could.

Now installation is simple and straightforward, configuration is complicated but straightforward. And at about no. 10 in, we found out that the first ones were failing.

A bug? Not really, everything worked as intended, except once we left one running, it was at the mercy of power outages. And the power outages had a very bad habit of resetting the signal source. So after a while they would all turn to a black screen.

A fix was already in place, we left remote controls so they could all be set to the proper source. Yet nobody was able to do so, for some reason.

Well, you see, professional screens have two identical hdmi inputs + an extra display port and newer models even had built in videowall feature using display port output and input ports.

And so the story of fixing the videowalls begins: 
first order of business, go to all videowalls and place the hdmi on input no. 1. 10.000 km and an oil change later -done

Now they should be fixed, right? Technically yea, you would use a remote and set the input to hdmi 1. Voilla. Except, randomly, and without proper cause, one, two ore even 3 TV's would not respond, and you got a videowall working with a missing piece.
This was so bad that we went to order of business number 2: discover the issue. 100 phonecalls later, another 10.000 km and an oil change - done.

Every videowall had one IR receiver and the signal was then passed to unscreened cheap jack-jack cables. (You know, the cheapest ones possible).

So our trusty supplier recommends a 10 dollar cable. It has gold plating, double sleeve, noise damping layer.
Oh, did I mention the noise? Some contractors installed 9 HDMI cables running too close to one of the power lines. Not even one was usable. And they didn't even have a noise screen.

Anyway. The problem is solved. I get this to every manager. ""All 25 cent cables have to be replaced with 10 dollar cables and your videowalls will run forever).

I got reprimanded for attempting to make unjustifiable extra costs.
I did get one videowall running with expensive cables, and rumor has it that it still runs today.
As for the rest, they were decommissioned 1 year later because they required one full time employee with a company car, constantly setting the videowalls.",196,0,1,"Videowall cost cuts This is a continuation of my previous posts, especially ""check where you pay for your software"".

Budget? Why would you need a budget?,"Long, long ago, in a land about thirty miles south of here, I got hired as tech support for three states’ offices of a huge nonprofit. They hadn’t had a tech guy in most of a year, and either they loved me or they were desperate. I’m sure it was love.

My boss was an accountant. She told me on my first day that THE priority was getting laptops to all the field staff. Most of them were using pencil and paper, since their crop of aging Dells had been unsupported for almost a year of hard use.

I looked over the list of hardware, and immediately determined that most of it wasn’t worth keeping even if it had worked. We’re talking seriously obsolete laptops that had been getting abused long past their projected lifespans. So I asked, what is my budget?

I figured that if I had a decent budget, I would buy about a pallet of laptops, and spend a few weeks imaging and shipping. If I had a small budget, I’d buy a few and fix the rest. Tiny budget, fix them all.

She looked slightly uncomfortable.

”Well, there is no budget.”

I knew, just KNEW, that this did not mean spend all the dollars, but I asked anyway. “So, like, cost is no object?”

No.

The entire IT budget had just been sitting around not getting spent for that year. And they had needed to put a new roof on the office where my boss worked. My IT budget was keeping rain off my boss’ head, but not keeping pencils out of the field staff’s hands.

She repeated that my priority was getting the laptops (which were helpfully stacked in the basement, by the oil tank) fixed. With no money, zero dollars, not one penny for parts.

There turned out to be around fifty laptops there, of three generations. I managed to cannibalize enough parts to fix about a third of them, which made my boss 33% happy and gave me a 33% chance of continued employment.

I was considering how to most effectively beg my boss for a budget, when the National IT convention for the organization started. We got flown to Texas, and I got to see just how far down the prosperity ladder our three-state group was. We weren’t quite dead last, but we were definitely the po folks in the group. The bigger states were complaining about how much they had to pay to GET RID OF the Models of laptop I was fixing!

A light went off for me, and I generously offered to securely dispose of those laptops for two of the wealthiest states.

Over the next month, I received about 160 laptops, mostly even working! My field staff loved me. Some of them, the newer hires, had never had a company laptop before.

My boss, far from approving of my meeting an impossible goal, yelled at me because all the other accountants sneered at her. My stunt reminded them all of how poor we were.

Ya just can’t make some people happy.

"SharePoint is Broken, or; Issues Arising in High Turnover Development Teams","So, I've wanted to write this story out for a while. As a disclaimer, I'm not really a technical person - I had the fortune/misfortune of being the youngest person in the office and inherited a lot of technical type things from a man with many more skills than me. 

The company I worked for was a Big IT Company (but of the type that nobody has ever heard of), multimillion in profit, billions in revenue, purely B2B. I worked in an offshoot of the Sales teams, in the Bid Team. We wrote tender responses, worked with wonderful technical people (and others who had titles like Solution Architect but couldn't use a printer).

Because most of our work was collaborative, it was decided to invest in a custom built instance of Sharepoint that would best suit our needs. As luck would have it, we had a team in the Professional Services department who specialised in SharePoint, and they built a beautiful looking instance for us. We could click a few buttons, and SharePoint sites would automatically build, according to a set template, and people from across the business could easily collaborate with us. 

Time went on, and the SharePoint team slowly left, and were replaced, as happens in large workplaces where people feel unappreciated. A new manager for the team came in, and wondered why they were supporting tickets for our problems when their role was deemed to be consultative. It was decided that support would be handed over to our Eastern European Service Desk. 

Problem number one appeared when we called SD for a small problem - nobody had told them that they were now supporting this. Easily resolved, with our strong connections to Senior Management, it got pushed through the correct channels at speed. 

Problem number two occurred the next time we called SD for a small problem - the SharePoint team hadn't passed over any documentation. This led into problem number three - the SharePoint team had never WRITTEN any documentation, despite selling this custom instance on to a number of customers. 

With the SharePoint team having limited resources, a very technical man in our team took it upon himself to document how the system was set up. All of the settings, all of the bits and pieces we saw, common errors and their fixes (that we had come across over the years), etc. And, for the remainder of the 18 months he worked there, it was enough. I really wish I hadn't accepted the small raise to take on a number of his responsibilities, however. 

Until one miserable raining Monday morning in November (in the UK, most Monday mornings are miserable and rainy), we came into work, and tried to hit the magic button that built us a site. And it failed. We tested it with different users, at different sites, in different browsers. Nothing, no dice. So we called the Service Desk, who called the SharePoint team, who all sat very puzzled. 

The only piece of the puzzle the very technical man hadn't managed to solve, was the Site Builder module, which sat in Azure. The password had been lost to time, and the person who had originally set up the subscription to Azure had left many moons prior. As had the back up contact. And the back up, back up contact. I vividly recall his notes on this matter, they read ""Nothing to be done about this, issue is with SharePoint team to resolve. They said we should hope it never breaks."" And here I was, responsible in the eyes of my boss, my team and the whole Sales Team for finding out what was wrong. 

I spent an hour trying to get the SharePoint Team to pick up the phone, while getting my team to download and back up any live projects on the platform in case the whole thing fell over. Eventually, I gave up on trying to call the SharePoint team directly, and hit up the staff directory to find (vaguely) sensible people who worked in the same office as them. I called up an Internal Account Manager who owed me a favour, and convinced him to wander the building with his mobile phone, and to put the thing in the hand of anyone from the SharePoint team. Thankfully, that only took him fifteen minutes. 

The Head of SharePoint he found sounded quite stressed (given we were his largest internal client, and well known for being influential I can understand why), but was professional as we tried to narrow down the problem. All the connections and bits we could see were functioning. There was something almost blocking the traffic to the Azure Site Builder. We checked with Internal IT, no new firewalls, nothing new on the network. We decided that we absolutely had to see what was inside Azure, and we would have to work out what the password was. Internal IT brought back up the email of the former staff member who had set up this portion of Azure in the first place, and routed any incoming mail to the Head of SharePoint, while he tried to reset the password. 

The reset came through, we were still on the phone and crowed in victory! He reset the password, to be met with a large warning that the bill for Azure hadn't been paid. Curious and curiouser, I agreed to speak with the Finance department to work out why our payment had failed, only to find that we had never paid anything of that (relatively small, several hundred pound) value to Azure, and certainly not for the six years our instance of SharePoint had been working.

I'm unclear on the exact thoughts going through the Head of SharePoint's head as the penny dropped while he paged through paid invoices on what he could see of Azure, but I do know it resulted in a lot of swearing, and a shout across the office. A mumbled conversation I couldn't hear, and finally back to the phone to speak to me. ""We need to get this paid for, today, using the company card.""

Well that was something I could do, we had bribery chocolates stored in a cupboard, and a quick run upstairs to the CEO's PA got the invoice paid within twenty minutes, and SharePoint site builder running another twenty minutes after that. 

It was another few hours before I managed to unearth the reason the bill had gone unpaid - and how it had previously been paid. When it had originally been set up, for some odd quirk, the account wasn't linked to the company accounts at all. It was listed to the person who had left. And he'd paid it on his own card, and put the figure back on expenses, every month until he left, and he handed over the invoices to his replacement, who paid it on his own card and expensed it every month until he left. And then, it had been passed over to another SharePoint consultant who was paid a little bit less money (if this was because she was the only woman on the team, I don't know, but I have my suspicions). And so, close to Christmas, her credit card bounced and she couldn't make the payment. Over time, the information of what this payment was for had been lost to the winds, and so she resolved to pay it at the end of the week, when she got paid, and hopefully nothing would break in that time. 

There was quite some upset when it made the rounds of senior management, three successive Heads of SharePoint had collectively signed off over ten thousand pounds in expenses for this Site Builder, and had never questioned it. Expenses rules were tightened, and time passed, and the SharePoint team, always a low revenue earning team, was eventually phased out entirely. 

This year, I started a new job at a new company, but I still stay in touch with a few people at the big IT company. A week after I left, SharePoint went down again, but this time entirely. They couldn't work out why  it was broken, and now nobody in the business had the skills to fix it. I'm glad I missed that headache. I hear they've now switched to Teams.",808,0,1,"SharePoint is Broken, or; Issues Arising in High Turnover Development Teams So, I've wanted to write this story out for a while. As a disclaimer, I'm not really a technical person - I had the fortune/misfortune of being the youngest person in the office and inherited a lot of technical type things from a man with many more skills than me. 

The company I worked for was a Big IT Company (but of the type that nobody has ever heard of), multimillion in profit, billions in revenue, purely B2B. I worked in an offshoot of the Sales teams, in the Bid Team. We wrote tender responses, worked with wonderful technical people (and others who had titles like Solution Architect but couldn't use a printer).

Because most of our work was collaborative, it was decided to invest in a custom built instance of Sharepoint that would best suit our needs. As luck would have it, we had a team in the Professional Services department who specialised in SharePoint, and they built a beautiful looking instance for us. We could click a few buttons, and SharePoint sites would automatically build, according to a set template, and people from across the business could easily collaborate with us. 

Time went on, and the SharePoint team slowly left, and were replaced, as happens in large workplaces where people feel unappreciated. A new manager for the team came in, and wondered why they were supporting tickets for our problems when their role was deemed to be consultative. It was decided that support would be handed over to our Eastern European Service Desk. 

Problem number one appeared when we called SD for a small problem - nobody had told them that they were now supporting this. Easily resolved, with our strong connections to Senior Management, it got pushed through the correct channels at speed. 

Problem number two occurred the next time we called SD for a small problem - the SharePoint team hadn't passed over any documentation. This led into problem number three - the SharePoint team had never WRITTEN any documentation, despite selling this custom instance on to a number of customers. 

With the SharePoint team having limited resources, a very technical man in our team took it upon himself to document how the system was set up. All of the settings, all of the bits and pieces we saw, common errors and their fixes (that we had come across over the years), etc. And, for the remainder of the 18 months he worked there, it was enough. I really wish I hadn't accepted the small raise to take on a number of his responsibilities, however. 

Until one miserable raining Monday morning in November (in the UK, most Monday mornings are miserable and rainy), we came into work, and tried to hit the magic button that built us a site. And it failed. We tested it with different users, at different sites, in different browsers. Nothing, no dice. So we called the Service Desk, who called the SharePoint team, who all sat very puzzled.

It still turns on. How.,"A few years ago I was at work and a customer sold us his custom-build gaming tower. It was a nice one too with LED strips, light-up fans, an i7-8700K, an Asus ROG motherboard (that ended up being worth over €300 even used), a 2TB Samsung SSD and a liquid-cooled MSI Sea Hawk card - don't remember exactly what it was, a GTX 1080 maybe?

It took quite a while to scrub the oil (and the smell) off with isopropyl alcohol and a test to ensure that everything STILL worked by some divine intervention.

Now this became so normal that I would have a connection script ready for them that I would just activate as soon as they called, and this script would turn on their VPN. 

Anyway, this one night, I was out and not having a good time. The call came in well past midnight so I didn't even want to answer. They insist; ""what?"" ""Well, the usual, internet is down"".

""Yeah, thanks, we'll talk on Monday""

I get there, burst into the office, and politely ask the manager to show me how she 'cleans the server'. She refuses, citing heavy workload.

Check where you pay for your software!,"I was the senior IT guy in the company for 2 months now. I was still a bit overwhelmed by the job but slowly getting on top of it.
I get a call on the company phone, it's someone speaking English. It's one of the senior managers, 3rd in the country ranking: ""I need you in the head office now!"", ""Can I know what this is about?"" ""Yeah, we have a serious IT issue, come over now!"" ""OK, you do know it's a 6 hour drive"" ""Of course I know that, who do you take me for, there's a cab waiting for you outside your office and a plane ticket will be mailed shortly, don't miss the flight""

Well, this must be serious. 2 and a half hours later I'm in the head office, the accounting department looks like a hostage situation, everyone is nearly crying, top management is shouting.
""W-what happened?"" One of the senior accountants calls me over, shows me a software interface, and error messages with every attempt to operate it.
I whisper ""how bad is this?"" ""Well nobody can do their job, and we have a pending audit"" ""shit, when did it start?"" 
""There was an update yesterday before days end""
I setup in an empty cubicle, as opposed to the main IT office in the same building. I am lost: I had never seen that software, never once been called about it, and it was never mentioned as being my responsibility. I call my manager (as a side note, it management was global, while I was the senior one in the country) ""hi, we have a serious problem with X software, I don't really know what to do"" ""don't do anything, it's not your job"" ""sigh""
I do the only sensible thing and attempt to contact the software provider. ""Hello, I am ..., Calling on behalf of ... Company from the {country}, we have a problem since the last software update"" ""erm, where are you calling from?"" ""{Country}"" ""erm, please hold"" 5 minutes go by
""Sorry sir, but we have no clients in {country}"", ""dude, what?"", ""Our last patch removed support for document formats from {country}""
""So what can we do, is there a rollback possible?"" ""No, as I stated, we don't have any clients in {country}, therefore we are unable to offer support""

"Tech savvy parents, usually","Firstly, let me start by explaining my parents are pretty tech savvy, they understand the concepts of cpu/ram/hdd, know to keep things up to date, ignore foreign princes and calls from microsoft, find the right download button etc. 

So usually when they call it's something more serious. But sometimes even savvy people make mistakes...

###Story 1

So I get a call from my mum one sunny day. For context we're in the UK, and usually internet is via the phone line unless you have cable.

&gt;**Mum:** Hey, our internet is down.

&gt;**Me:** OK let's check through the basics _(I check with Mum that they've run through the restarting things, checking connections - and as I expected they had)_

&gt;**Me:** Hmm, let's check what the router says. Hit 192.168.0.1 and login. _Me directs her to router status page, this was many years ago with a DG834 so it's got some logging, but a bit vague._

&gt;**Mum:** ""LCP is not allowed to come up"" _(or something along those lines, I forget)_

&gt;**Me:** Well that's pretty vague, let's just check the (RJ11) cable and microfilter.

&gt;_**Dad** just goes and replaces both as they have them spare_

&gt;**Mum:** Still nothing. Same thing in the status window.

&gt;**Me:** Let me double check the $Telco status page... Nothing at $Telco is up for your area. I'll come over and have a look, I'll bring a spare modem/router. _($Telco loves to threaten charges for engineer visits for end-user issues)_.

I arrive. Hellos/hugs etc.

I notice her mobile on the side table... and have a horrible dawning realisation.

&gt;**Me:** Please tell me you checked the landline phone.

&gt;_**Mum** gets a concerned look as I move to pick up the phone. My expression says it all._

&gt;**Phone dial tone:** _silence_

&gt;**The Room:** _silent disbelief_

&gt;**Crickets:** _chirping away_

A group facepalm follows.

It probably should have occurred to me during diagnosis, but sometimes obvious things slip by. I didn't realise they'd called from mum's mobile (they had free minutes on the mobiles and not on the landline any more).

&gt;**Me:** Yeah, your phone line is dead.

&gt;**Mum:** I'll call $Telco...

###Story 2

My parents had agreed to do some digitising old photos and negatives for some family friends, they have a nice high end Epson scanner with all the bells and whistles, from about 10 years ago.

I get a call from mum, we usually use speakerphone to chat to people in each room.

&gt; **Mum:** Hey, we just got the photo scanner back out, and it's not working. No lights on at all.

&gt; _I direct them to check it over for any obvious signs of damage or moisture ingress, it's been in storage for a while. Nothing obvious wrong_

&gt; **Me:** OK, do you guys have a multimeter about? For testing voltages? (This scanner uses a separate inline transformer).

&gt; **Mum:** A multi-what? _(Ok, I expected that)_

&gt; **Dad:** I think I've got one of those in the shed. _(I expected that also)_

&gt;_**Dad** goes and returns with multimeter_

&gt; **Me:** Test the **output** of the adapter with it plugged in the wall - **carefully** (not knowing what damage may have been done).

&gt; **Dad:** Looks like ""0"".

&gt; **Me:** 0 what? Is it set to volts?

&gt; _Turns out this multimeter is also ancient, of questionable provenance, and the display obscure. I'm unconvinced the multimeter is providing useful readings_

&gt; **Me:** Erm, I'll come over with my multimeter just to check, before you spend money on a replacement transformer.

&gt; _**Me** goes over and checks, verifies it's dead as a dodo_

They get a replacement from eBay, as it's a generic Epson inline transformer. All good.

######_One week later_

&gt; **Mum:** Sooo... The scanner is dead.

&gt; **Me:** What? Really? After you got it working with the new transformer?

&gt; **Mum:** Yeah, no lights, nobody is home.

&gt; _I start a mental inventory of the tools I'll need to take it apart_

&gt; **Me:** Tried unplugging and replugging etc?

&gt; **Mum:** Yup _(I can hear her do it again right there, both power and usb)_

&gt; **Me:** OK, I'll come on over and take a look at it, but no guarantees I'll get it working.

I head over and take a look, I start by double checking the cheapo eBay inline transformer, it's providing a nice stable voltage. Plug it all back in and nothing.

I unpack screwdrivers, multimeter etc. ready to take it apart and diagnose.

Then I notice the power switch on the scanner is OFF.

&gt; **Me:** **Please tell me you turned the scanner ON when you tried to use it?**

&gt; _Both parents immediately turn completely and entirely red_

&gt; _**Me immediately starts laughing so hard my sides hurt, and I can't breathe long enough to talk**_

To say I nearly wet myself laughing at their expense is an understatement. They used to (and still do) turn it on/off as and when they use it and finish using it, but to miss such a dumb step this time really embarrassed them. We all had a big laugh out of that one.

&gt;**Me:** Well that's pretty vague, let's just check the (RJ11) cable and microfilter.

&gt;_**Dad** just goes and replaces both as they have them spare_

&gt;**Mum:** Still nothing. Same thing in the status window.

&gt;**Me:** Let me double check the $Telco status page... Nothing at $Telco is up for your area. I'll come over and have a look, I'll bring a spare modem/router. _($Telco loves to threaten charges for engineer visits for end-user issues)_.

I arrive. Hellos/hugs etc.

I notice her mobile on the side table... and have a horrible dawning realisation.

&gt;**Me:** Please tell me you checked the landline phone.

&gt;_**Mum** gets a concerned look as I move to pick up the phone. My expression says it all._

&gt;**Phone dial tone:** _silence_

&gt;**The Room:** _silent disbelief_

&gt;**Crickets:** _chirping away_

A group facepalm follows.

It probably should have occurred to me during diagnosis, but sometimes obvious things slip by. I didn't realise they'd called from mum's mobile (they had free minutes on the mobiles and not on the landline any more).

&gt;**Me:** Yeah, your phone line is dead.

&gt;**Mum:** I'll call $Telco...

###Story 2

My parents had agreed to do some digitising old photos and negatives for some family friends, they have a nice high end Epson scanner with all the bells and whistles, from about 10 years ago.

I get a call from mum, we usually use speakerphone to chat to people in each room.

&gt; **Mum:** Hey, we just got the photo scanner back out, and it's not working. No lights on at all.

&gt; _I direct them to check it over for any obvious signs of damage or moisture ingress, it's been in storage for a while. Nothing obvious wrong_

&gt; **Me:** OK, do you guys have a multimeter about? For testing voltages? (This scanner uses a separate inline transformer).

&gt; **Mum:** A multi-what? _(Ok, I expected that)_

&gt; **Dad:** I think I've got one of those in the shed. _(I expected that also)_

&gt;_**Dad** goes and returns with multimeter_

&gt; **Me:** Test the **output** of the adapter with it plugged in the wall - **carefully** (not knowing what damage may have been done).

&gt; **Dad:** Looks like ""0"".

&gt; **Me:** 0 what? Is it set to volts?

&gt; _Turns out this multimeter is also ancient, of questionable provenance, and the display obscure. I'm unconvinced the multimeter is providing useful readings_

&gt; **Me:** Erm, I'll come over with my multimeter just to check, before you spend money on a replacement transformer.

&gt; _**Me** goes over and checks, verifies it's dead as a dodo_

They get a replacement from eBay, as it's a generic Epson inline transformer. All good.

######_One week later_

&gt; **Mum:** Sooo... The scanner is dead.

&gt; **Me:** What? Really? After you got it working with the new transformer?

&gt; **Mum:** Yeah, no lights, nobody is home.

&gt; _I start a mental inventory of the tools I'll need to take it apart_

&gt; **Me:** Tried unplugging and replugging etc?

&gt; **Mum:** Yup _(I can hear her do it again right there, both power and usb)_

&gt; **Me:** OK, I'll come on over and take a look at it, but no guarantees I'll get it working.

I head over and take a look, I start by double checking the cheapo eBay inline transformer, it's providing a nice stable voltage. Plug it all back in and nothing.

I unpack screwdrivers, multimeter etc. ready to take it apart and diagnose.

Then I notice the power switch on the scanner is OFF.

&gt; **Me:** **Please tell me you turned the scanner ON when you tried to use it?**

&gt; _Both parents immediately turn completely and entirely red_

&gt; _**Me immediately starts laughing so hard my sides hurt, and I can't breathe long enough to talk**_

To say I nearly wet myself laughing at their expense is an understatement. They used to (and still do) turn it on/off as and when they use it and finish using it, but to miss such a dumb step this time really embarrassed them. We all had a big laugh out of that one.

Ethernet Cable... You Mean A Charger?,"Hello all, I'm back with another fun story. This is a story that happened a few days ago, but is still makes me chuckle and die a little inside at the same time.

A new user called into the help desk to assist in a first time login, because the computer she's on was not connect to the companies network so it wouldn't recognize her domain credentials. The fix for this is very simple though. Plug in an ethernet cable in a core office location. That's it, that is all there is to it. It should be pretty simple right? Well if it was I wouldn't be posting the story here.

The call goes something like this;

&gt;Me: Thank you for contacting the \[insert company name here\] Helpdesk, my name is EonThief how can I help you?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: I'm a new employee and I need help logging into the computer.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: I can definitely assist with that, are there any error messages on the screen when you try and login?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: Yeah.  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: Can you please read them for me?  
&gt;  
&gt;User: Yeah it says the domain isn't available or something like that.

Normally I ask for the error verbatim but in this case there are only two causes for this type of error, either the computer isn't on the domain or, as I said above, not connected to the network. I checked AD and it was indeed on the domain.

&gt;Me: So that computer is on the domain, are you currently in a core office location?

Well that was the power cord.,"I work for an insurance agency in their tech support. I mostly do training of our new associates and project work for our department, but when I was still taking our internal 'customers' (Read: Employees of said Insurance company) I had this interaction with someone.

Before I get to the interaction; it is important to understand, I give incredibly descriptive but dumbed down and easy to follow instructions. (Which is why I am a trainer now)

Interaction Follows:

Me: IT Support. This is &lt;Me&gt; can I start with your &lt;credential verification process &gt;
Customer: &lt;Gives credentials&gt;
Me: How can I help you today?
Customer: &lt;Long winded explanation of nothing to do with current issue that is currently murdering my handling time of this call&gt; ... I can't log into my Computer.

Me: Okay. Well I can help you with that. Let me take a look at your profile.
&lt;Checking Active Directory&gt;
Me: I saw that your profile was locked out and I went ahead and unlocked you. Can you go ahead and try and log in for me with your Windows password?
Customer: It still won't let me in and I know I'm typing my password correctly.

&lt;Asked customer to try again to confirm the domain/proxy controller wasn't locking her out&gt;

Me: Okay usually when you get locked out and attempt to sign in too many times the system essentially 'disables' your network. Could you please shut down your computer for me?

Me: That's okay we can cycle the network another way. On the back of the computer there will be a lot of black cables and there is only one blue or green cable. That cable also has an end that is plugged into your computer that is clear and looks like an old phone jack with a pull clip on the top. This cable is also the only cable that goes from the computer to your desk phone. Do you see this cable?
Customer: Yes!
Me: Go ahead and disconnect that cable for thirty seconds and plug it back in.

Sophie: Ummm....neither? I'm seeing like....a deer? with antlers? but its tilted to the side...oh wait it looks like one of those things in Texas....a cow skull!  


Lorixs: A cow skull?

Sophie: Yeah! or maybe even a reindeer...but its tilted.

The one that got away,"As a tech, the worst kind of case is the unicorn that's impossible to diagnose.
It happened when was working at the front desk of a laptop repair shop, back in the early 2010s.
A perfectly normal day, when a perfectly normal guy walks in holding the perfectly normal Toshiba Satellite Core2Duo with 4 GB DDR2 RAM, sporting a Windows 7 clean as a whistle.
""I need you to fix this laptop and I need it quick""

""Well, what's wrong with it?""

""It crashes""

""Ok, we'll check it out and let you know""

As the front desk it was my job to do a basic diagnosis on every laptop before it was assigned to a tech. 
Software issues were strictly front desk issues. 
So I take the guys laptop, remove the harddrive, put in my all knowing test OS and start blasting the laptop with primes, stress tests, ram tests, the real deal.
Nothing, that laptop is rock solid. 
I call the guy: "" look, your laptop is fine, it's most likely a software issues, can we take a look at your harddrive?"" He replies ""anything, just fix it"". So I plug the HDD back in, go for a smart check and then for a quick scan. Nothing. I start it up, no windows password, licenced av installed, check event viewer. Nothing. 

I call the guy: "" I am checking your laptop, I did my best, but I just can't make it crash"" to which he replies coldly ""try Google"".
So I open the browser with full confidence, i type in Google.com and hit enter, I see the page for about 1 second and BOOM, blue screen. 

Ok, I got it to crash. Let's try internet explorer, BOOM, crash.
Ok, let's try the test drive again, IT MUST BE A SOFTWARE ISSUE.
BOOM, Kernel Panic! Ok, this just got weird. I turn to the hammer, HIRENS. Nothing crashes a HIRENS, I boot from USB, turn on network, start the browser, and yeah: BSOD on a HIRENS.

Now I'm getting intrigued: IT'S the NIC; eth or WiFi? Doesn't matter, I'll replace the WiFi and check the eth as well. Blue Screen, every single time. I even try other websites, they last one second longer than Google does.

I get frustrated, time to replace RAM, Blue Screen.
Time to replace the CPU, luckily it was a socketed one, blue screen.
 I get the techs involved, show them the kernel panic, the HIRENS failing. The WiFi, the CPU, the RAM. 
Let's change some chips! Out goes the north bridge, out goes the south bridge, full bios reset, every chip with more than 20 pins goes out and a new one goes in place. We are already overtime but nobody wants to leave and miss the end, so we decide to come back first thing in the morning and get to the bottom of it.
Turns are taken on the microscope, we map the entire motherboard, every capacitor is measured. Nothing.
We put it back together, some 200$ worth of chips went in.
And Blue Screen.
Just as we give up, the guy walks in. ""Is it fixed?"" ""Yea, we fixed every potential future and passed problem! But it still refuses to run Google"". We gave it back to him, free of charge as we couldn't fix the issue. He was mad as hell when he saw the list of operations we had done ""all for nothing!? I need this for work"" ""sorry bud, it's a perfectly good laptop as long as you don't open Google""",164,0,1,"The one that got away As a tech, the worst kind of case is the unicorn that's impossible to diagnose.

We are already overtime but nobody wants to leave and miss the end, so we decide to come back first thing in the morning and get to the bottom of it.
Turns are taken on the microscope, we map the entire motherboard, every capacitor is measured. Nothing.
We put it back together, some 200$ worth of chips went in.
And Blue Screen.
Just as we give up, the guy walks in. ""Is it fixed?"" ""Yea, we fixed every potential future and passed problem! But it still refuses to run Google"". We gave it back to him, free of charge as we couldn't fix the issue. He was mad as hell when he saw the list of operations we had done ""all for nothing!? I need this for work"" ""sorry bud, it's a perfectly good laptop as long as you don't open Google"""

Can't you make Google do this?,"So, I'm the Web developer for a marketing agency. For the past 3-4 months our SEO guru and I have had the following conversation with our Account Specialists repeatedly:

Us: ""Yeah...you won't. It's published and the site map is updated but you'll need to wait for Google to re-scan the site. That can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks if you're really unlucky, and then it may not rank right away.""

AS: ""That's unacceptable. Can you not make Google scan the site faster?""

US: ""Well we can request Google to re-index the site, but it really doesn't seem to help much. They will index it when they index it. It still probably won't rank that quick.""

Hours later.....

US: ""Like we said. It will take Google a few days, possibly longer.""

AS: ""The client needs this page to show in search results. I insist you call Google and make them add it.""

US: ""Yeah....we'll get right on that.""

Evidently they read a misinformed blog article on this and took it for fact, so our solution was to turn it around on them.

"Solutions not appreciated, rather waste time and resources","I used to work as functional support engineer for 2 closely linked applications (in practice I also acted as application and technical support engineer) at a company that provided business to consumer technical services. To make matters worse I was the only one that oversaw the entire chain of applications. Much more applications like network management systems, CRM and middleware were involved for the services provided to customers.

&amp;#x200B;

We had outsourced software customization and more importantly systems integration to a third party supplier (1 of the biggest consultancy companies in the world), where our corporate mother had so called specialists (a lot of them insourced from said third party). One of the 2 applications 1 was responsible for was to meat a regulatory requirement and it was a highly specialized application. The official technical and application support at corporate regularly screwed up. And this was nothing different when setting up the test environment. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when we started the acceptance testing for new software releases I was to clear my schedule to execute these tests. In the beginning I complied. This was in a time that I already worked standard 90 hour weeks. Usually it took more than a week of the 2 weeks of testing to get the environment up and running. However I needed be present full time and I was strictly forbidden to work on production issues, because how time critical testing was. But I couldn't anything testing wise, so I started working on production issues. I was reprimanded for this a couple of times. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I started digging into the backend of of the applications in the test environment in order to seem busy and not to do production work. Even the application vendors helped me in understanding the environment, so soon enough I knew what the crucial points were and how to fix them, which I did. I'd say a win win situation... Wrong!!! I even got an official warning when I finally got the end to end process to work, since I couldn't have access to the back end or to the actual servers and that to fix these problems was the application and technical support staff's duty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next releases I just showed up about half an hour early before the official kick off, did some basic system tests and logged about 5-6 highest priority incidents about the environment not up and running. Then I sat down and started drinking coffee, chitchatting with other colleagues, just as long as I was around the test area. I refused to answer anything about production issues, since that already got me reprimanded before. However being the sole expert on the end to end process, I got a backlog in production issues that needed fixing. Which in term lead to big customer facing problems and complaints, but hey I wasn't allowed to do anything for production.

&amp;#x200B;

So after a couple of releases in which this happened my manager gave me permission that I would plan my time accordingly, so usually I was done in my 1st week of testing even before the official testing window started, due to the fact that the environment wasn't working.

Passcode skeleton key.,"I used to work for a call center that was trained in helping people resolve technical issues with their devices. I am only trained for a specific type of device species that I like to call The Forbidden Fruit. One day, a guy and his son call in because his son forgot the passcode to unlock his phone. I hated these calls because if you can't remember it, or it isn't working, the only way for us to help resolve it is to completely erase the device; The father started out very nice, not overly tech savy but not a complete peanut brain thankfully. We got through the initial greeting and then got down to the root of the problem. 

Dad: He's forgotten the password for his phone, how do we go about getting around that so he can get into his phone? 

Me, already feeling the pain of having to tell him the bad news: I'm so sorry, but if the passcode is forgotten the only way to remove it is to restore the device via computer; And I am absolutely able to walk you through that if you need. 

Dad: Don't you guys have a special 'unlock all' that can get around this?

Me: No, unfortunately we don't, I'm so sorry about that. 

Dad: That's stupid, you should have one of those because people forget their passwords all the time; You should be able to prepare for that and help us get into our phones.

Me: It would be a really great idea in theory, but they don't have one just to make sure there's no risk to your privacy. They want to protect that for you. (This is the answer given to us in training.) 

Dad: I understand that, but you don't have to give it out to the world, you can just get in my phone and unlock. Just access it remotely or whatever.

Me: That in itself poses a threat to security and privacy. If we gave it out to everyone then there wouldn't.....be a point to the passcode (I hated saying it like this but I'm terrible as explaining things in a kind way.) 

Dad: You don't have to tell people, just access my \*expletive\* phone and put it in yourself.

Me: We actually can't take control of a device at any time. If the device is unlocked we can share the screen but we can't take over. Again I'm really sorry about this, but the only way to get around it is erasing the phone.

Dad: Your company are \*expletive\* idiots! They can't actually expect people to remember their passwords! We shouldn't have to lose everything on our phones just because we forgot the password!

Me: I completely understand your frustration, I've done it to myself before and it's not a good time when it happens, but 'forbidden fruit' wants to protect privacy over everything else.

I went to his office, tried to log in with my account and had no problems. Asked him to log in with his and saw a message pop up. But as soon as the message came he immediately took the mouse from me and clicked the X before I could even blink.

I asked him why and said I now have to log out again and see if it comes up again.

He was very confused to why I had to do this.

So I logged out, asked him to log in again, same thing happened AGAIN!

It's a phone cable,"This just happened. I'll keep this short and sweet. 

So I've been working on getting a label printer connected to a client's network for 3 days. It's mostly due to being so busy but I digress.

They got two of these. One connected without an issue. The other didn't. They were both DHCP so I would have to statically assign them the IP they need. Got the first working no problem.

The second would never get on the network. See where I'm going with this? I had the client plug it into the switch when they said the cord wouldn't fit because it was a phone cable. I died a little inside. 3 days of troubleshooting....

Hey at least it's job security though right?",413,0,1,"It's a phone cable This just happened. I'll keep this short and sweet.

\#OM, Office manager, glad someone is here to fix her problems

\#LT, Local helpdesk, bravely and foolishly dove head first into the hell that is printer service, oops

\#OG, The genesis of this story

So, I’d been to this site previously with a senior tech to set up all the dozen or so shiny MFPs they had just signed contract on. Single floor modern open concept office deal, my favorite kind of site, climate controlled, low dust, no closets to shove machines into. The ideal by the book specs for one of these machine to work in. As for the deployment, we had gotten good thorough documentation and the sales drones had even been browbeat into actually doing a site survey because it was a national account. Full support from #LT and the clients corpo tech staff, everything delivered on time and not damaged, even got one little problem with a misconfigured switch so we could claim the install had already seen its disaster come and go.

I just paint that picture for you so I can emphasize how the coming carnage ruined a perfectly good install.

So about 2 weeks go by and #Mgr calls me up, “requests” I drop whatever I’m doing (uhoh) and blast off outta my territory to clients office because usual tech is unavailable. So we (the royal we) pack up and head out asap breaking speed limits for more than just fun this time. I arrive, am buzzed in, and led to the victim. There I find #OM and #LT next to, of course, the biggest and most expensive (like 50k+, my Subaru more than twice over) machine on the contract. #OM unhappy, #LT worried, and doors wide open all over the machine. F. Step 1, ~~interrogate~~ question the ~~suspects~~ users. Same story I’m sure we’re all familiar with here. Worked the night before, morning shift said it’s broke, no prior reported issues, why’s a new machine broke so quickly, no security camera on machine, ain’t nobody know nothin’…….. sure. But we put on our professional face and assure the customer that this is something we will figure out for them and make things right. 

So, what I did get out of the 2 of them was that there was an error code, that no one had remembered or recorded, and “strange sounds”, no jams (why did I believe that?). So I reboot the machine with a service reset, expect to hear some squealing or rattling, but lord above it sounded like a scene from the exorcist. It starts to scream and grind and vibrate, stopped just short of spinning its touch screen completely around and puking developer at me when it coded out…. Fuser motor failure to turn, no shit. So open goes the side door and of course its full of jams. #OM and #LT have made themselves scarce right before I had gotten to turning it on. So I have naught but empty space to give a look of disapproval.

Fast forward past a whole bunch of disassembly, accordion-ed paper, and obliterated gears, a picture starts to form. Luckily the only section of the machine that seems to have suffered was the fusing section and associated drive. Belt, devs, drums, ect live to fail another day. But there's some paper really jammed into that fuser, and it seems to have been in there so long its clear baked onto the pressure roller. But this brings us to our problem, I’ve placated #OM for now, but she needs this machine back, and management has give me a blank check to get it done. So this is a no kidding we actually mean get this thing fixed asap. Now normally I’d just run to the warehouse and grab a replacement fuser slap it in there and get the customer back up. But this machine was bran new, new new, top of the line new, first of its kind new, still out gassing that lovely new tech smell new. And we did not have readily available spare parts for them yet, they were still busy using those new fusers coming off the line to build new machines back across the pacific. #Mgr and his boss were both being total bosses and by hook, crook, blackmail, or other unmentionable act fightin’ to get me one of those spares that may yet exist, as I had told them as the pieces begun to fall into place that such would likely be a necessity. Isn’t it great when management trusts the professional opinion that they hired you for? Back on topic, spare isn’t showing up till least the day after tomorrow, and were already an hour or 2 into ot territory, but I gotta try to get this thing back into a state in which I can at-least give it a temporary fix the next day. Talking to others I had put together that I could swap enough of the parts off of older but similar machines to get this thing working. But that roller, and the frame it was in needed to be salvaged. So after way too much gentle pulling and prying and working the edges. The paper started to come off! Yes, YES! Slowly, slowly, gently, gent….. wait a second. Why does this paper feel so heavy… and textured…. And SLIDE! SPRONG! F%^K! Nearly crapped myself as the entire rest of the paper wrapped around the roller came loose in one go. Quick check and thank the spheres there was no further damage when the stuff let go. So I turned the attention to what I had in my hands.

Time to reflect a bit.

Have you ever held a concept? The object embodiment of an idea in your hands? Smelt the odors wafting off of it? Stared at it’s physical manifestation in our plane.

The very essence of guilt, weigh heavy in my hands. It’s stink of cooked plastic and waxes stinging my nose. And its devilish, sinister mark staring me right back in the face. A MS clipart trophy wreathed by a circular marquee that read something like “Let’s go accounting, fitness champs 201x”.

…….

An iron on t-shirt transfer….. several actually….

***screams internally***

Welp, that’s enough for one day. So I pack up, stick everything in a box, leave a sign not to touch **anything** and go the F home.

… Day 2

Next morning I arrive bright and early at the warehouse and start salvaging parts off of donor machines and grabbing the new parts on my shopping list. Parts in hand, and maybe after a short stop at dunks, I’m back on site ready to solve the impossible and reign as a conquering hero. So I head over to grab the fuser from its box and tear it apart for a rebuild. And there's the clipart trophy staring right back at me… from the bottom. Of an. Empty. Box.

What have I done to accrue such a karma deficit?

Ok quick plan of action….. find manglement and work down! Break! GO!

\#ME: Hay #OM! Good mornin’. (puttin’ on that customer service voice)

\#OM: Good morning #ME

-small talk-

\#ME: so…… one issue, um. I left a bunch of parts here last night, but I think someone moved some of them. Maybe cleaning staff…..?

\#OM: Oh you mean the big part you were focusing on?

\#ME: Yes! (YES!)

\#OM: I think #LT has it

\#ME: Ok (…)

\#OM: he was taking a good look at it

\#ME: Ok (please)

\#OM: And those parts you were pointing out were bent yesterday

\#ME: Yep(no)

\#OM: He's confident he can bend them back straight again

\#ME: Ok (NO!)

\#ME: Can you point me towards his office, I have stuff to repair that part with me (NONONONONONONONONONONO!)

And there lay fuser. Murdered by the best of intentions. The frame holding the pressure mechanism mangled beyond saving.

\#LT: So I got some pretty good needle nose and vice grips so I thought I could maybe get it straight and us back up this morning

\#ME: So… no luck? (just goin thru the motions)

\#LT:  I mean you got the parts to fix it up anyways, so what's the harm

\#ME: …

\#LT: …

\#ME: …

\#LT: …

\#ME: …

\#LT: You… You do have the parts you need?

And this is the point where I have to turn to give #LT the look. 
Not the angry look. 
Or even the you dun fucked up look. 
But the sad look. The one that says “sorry son, I know we promised you a bike for xmas, but we just don’t have the money this year”

\#ME: not anymore.

Aftermath

Well #LT was worried, but I’m not gonna throw the man under the bus. I wrote the fuser off as ending up, unfortunately, not being salvageable even with the repair parts (yanno, like a liar). Past the time it would take to get the machine back up and running nothing was lost as the entire fuser was to be replaced anyways once the spare was sourced.

But there remains but one more player in our tale of carnage and woe. #OG

So nursing the fresh emotional wounds of finding my one hope to resolve this dead on a work bench, I track down #OM and explain my findings from the previous evening, presenting to her scrutiny the icon of guilt I had extracted. Some people were called and conversations were had and in lockstep with #OM we charged to confront the guilty party. I had yet to notice the hesitation in her gait.

Then in front of us was the genesis of these events. Behind her desk sitting in her chair equipped with one of those wooden bead back manager mats you normally associate with cab drivers. Staring completely unaware of the consequences of her careless actions.

In front of us sat this woman. This woman who had offered me candy from the bowl on her desk. Who had chatted me up about how her husband used to ride a motorcycle like mine before he passed. Who would share tales about her grand kids. Who wore decorative sweaters it looks like she knit herself. Who had rosey cheeks and always seemed to talk in a sweet and cheery voice. Who looked like she was 10 seconds from fetching a pan of fresh baked cookies magically from below her desk. In front of me sat this lovely sweet woman, in a cubicle filled with cat plushies and pictures of her grand kids. Oh no! In front of me sat office grandma, blissfully unaware she just cost the company 5 figures in parts and service.

**I… I.. I can’t hold this woman accountable for this!**

And again thank the stars no one else could either. She had previously used the tshirt transfers in her home printer and thought they would be great for making some custom shirts to raise office morale. The most me or #OM could muster was a little finger waggle and an explanation its bad for these kinds of printers. What about all the missing sheets that ended up in the fuser. Didn't even notice and didn't know the new machine was not supposed to sound like a diesel truck. And that was it……

Really. No fallout. No one got in trouble. Customer was ready to pay the entire cost of the event, but my management (completely unnecessarily and unprompted) offered to eat half the cost. 2 days later the fuser arrived from whatever sealed bunker it was being kept locked away in. And that was many hours of my life I'll never get back. Now 5 more after writing this monstrous 2000+ word post. 


So. Sleep time for me.

Pour one out for our dead homie, fuser.

Be cautious of the ignorant and well intentioned.

Good night, and good luck.

"Needs it fixed now, but cannot make themself available","My first post :D

One part of my job is being a one-woman helpdesk for a small printer dealer/agent.

Customer texted me an issue with their printer yesterday end of day, I placed the service call through my portal right away this morning. Printer company always calls the customer to verify company name and address then perform any additional troubleshooting that I didn't document before dispatching a service tech. Customer claims that all their information is false and they don't have time to troubleshoot \*CLICK\*

Printer company's helpdesk calls me, apparently customer hung up on them. The company name was correct but we fix the address. They ask me what hours the customer is available and I tell them i have no idea. They dispatch service. 

Same day, the tech calls the customer but the customer says ""I'm busy and can't talk right now"" \*CLICK\* Customer is then out of service area for several hours.

Hours later (still same day) I get a call from the customer upset that the tech came when she wasn't in the office. Because of this, the issue didn't get looked at because the only person who was at the office didn't know what the issue was. 

She goes on for a few minutes about when the tech is going to be out and needing him to talk to her first. I'm just like ""Uh... He tried... How would you like me to prevent this in the future?"" 

Her: ""IDK""

Fantastic, glad we got that settled",164,0,1,"Needs it fixed now, but cannot make themself available My first post :D

I found a LIVE cockroach inside a 14 year old’s computer.,"So I work as IT at a school. The other day a student came in saying their screen was having problems and their computer was being “glitchy”. I assumed it was probably a screen cable or connection issue, so I popped it open to check inside. As soon as I open it, a half inch cockroach began scurrying around the computer, eventually running underneath the motherboard. I’ve seen some very disgusting things, but never have I seen a LIVE cockroach in a CHILD’s computer. The kid got his laptop back, and it turned out that it was a motherboard issue, but this heavily disgusts me.  All I could think about was that poor kids home life, which somehow resulted in a live cockroach ending up in his school laptop. (Also, fun fact: our school offers a class called computer technician- it teaches kids how to repair the school laptops and gives them experience in the IT workplace).
I’ve got plenty of other stories to tell as well, this job seriously proves interesting.",1567,0,1,"I found a LIVE cockroach inside a 14 year old’s computer. So I work as IT at a school.

My customer’s laptop shut off “For no Apparent Reason” LOL,"So this happened a few years ago. As stated in an earlier post, in my town, I am a locally known computer guy. On the side from my full-time job, I build systems for people, fix systems, set up new systems, etc.

One evening I am at home and a call came in. It is a customer I had helped many times and two years prior, helped her get a laptop and set it up for her and set up her wireless router after her Satellite Internet got installed. Satellite was her only option as she was in a very rural area.

Upon answering, my customer say’s “I have a serious problem.” I ask what was going on. She proceeds to tell me that she was using her laptop, everything was working great, and all of a sudden, it just shut itself off. Thinking to myself, that yeah that is strange, I started going through the diagnostics. I asked her first off, what she was doing when it happened. She said she was just playing on Facebook. My next thought was maybe it was sitting on her lap or on blankets or something and it over heated causing it to shut off for safety sake. So I asked if she was just sitting at her desk. She said, “No I was laying in bed.” Ahhh ok. Now we are getting somewhere. I told her that maybe the airflow was obstructed and it shut off. I asked her if the bottom felt hot. She said no, not really.

So then I said, make sure that the power adapter did not come loose from the laptop or at the power brick part. This is where it gets good. Her response was, “What power adapter?” I said, “the power for the laptop, make sure it didn’t come out of the laptop. She says, and I am not joking, “I don’t have a power adapter for this laptop.”

Ummm. I am confused. I asked her what does she mean she don’t have a power adapter for the laptop. She replied by saying, “Remember when you set this up, you set up wireless. I don’t have a power adapter for it.” Before I went further into this, I asked her if she usually lays in bed with her laptop. She said no that this was the first time she removed it from the desk and took it to her bedroom. Ahhh Haaa!

So I told her that I think the battery died and told her to take the laptop back to the desk and locate the power plug and plug the laptop back in. She argued and told me that I was not listening to her or understanding her and she insisted that there is not and never has been a power plug for the laptop. In the most professional and strategic was possible, I informed her that there is not such thing as wireless power, and that what she was referring to was wireless internet. She insisted that she has never had a power plug for the laptop but she took it back to the desk.

So after some explaining and describing the power plug and where to plug it in, she finally gets it plugged in. I tell her to hit the power button and what do ya know, it powers up. Problem solved. I explained to her that all laptops have to have a power adapter to keep the battery charged and that I assumed that when she took the laptop off of the desk, she inadvertently unplugged it and after some time the battery died causing it to shut down. At this point she was satisfied with my answer and thanked me.

HOLD ON!! IT CONTINUES!! LOL

So about now, she starts brainstorming and trying to think about how the power adapter could have come unplugged. I again tell her, that when she picked it up off of the desk and walked away, the plug probably just popped out. It was like she did not even hear my explanation. She came up with her own theory. I swear I cannot make this stuff up.

She says, “Oh I think I know how that came unplugged.” Interested I asked how. She explains that earlier in the day, she noticed her internet went out and she continues to explain that she knew the issue was snow piled up on the satellite dish. She explained how she got her broom, went outside, and swept the snow off of the dish. That is all she said lol. I sat there waiting, until she followed it up with, “So yeah I probably knocked the power cable loose when I did that.”

Not wanting to deal with this anymore, I simply said, yeah probably and ended the call. I could not bring myself to even charge her for the service call.

I will be posting more of these as I think of them. Hope you enjoyed!!

That Time I [Single-handedly] Fixed an Aircraft....,"....for values of [Single-handedly] that include “using just one hand”. A Completely Unhelpful^TM TLDR is at the bottom

My form of Tech Support is aircraft maintenance, working on fixed-wing aeroplanes and helicopters with a value ranging from mid-five-figures to mid-eight-figures. They usually can be divided into airborne aluminium pit-ponies or their owners’ pride-and-joy; even a business jet worth more than ten million dollars can be treated as a workhorse, while a 45-year-old 40-thousand-dollar bugsmasher may be pampered by its owner.
_______________________________________________________
The events I describe here took place several years ago. 

This story begins with my colleagues and I giving a business jet back to two pilots, after we had spent [hectomonies] of the owner’s wealth in performing various maintenance tasks on it. After giving the aircraft the once-over, they climbed inside, shut the entry door and had both engines started within a few minutes. 

After a short time, silence broke out as the engines shut down again. This starting-up-then-shutting-down process is known in aircraft maintenance circles as a *Bad Thing*. My colleagues and I ~~gathered anxiously at the front of the hangar and awaited further developments with bated breath while clutching at strings of pearls~~ ignored the silence and continued to eat our lunches. 

A few moments later [Bossman] came into the lunch room and said, “hey Gert, the intercom on [RegistrationOfAircraftOutside] isn’t working; the captain can hear the copilot but can’t talk to him. Go outside and have a look at it please”.

Gertbengert: “Dang, always at lunchtime”

&amp;nbsp;

*Thinks* I know what this is. 

&amp;nbsp;

On downing my lunch-eating implements, walking outside onto the apron in front of the hangar, opening the aircrat’s door, entering the cockpit and exchanging with the pilots the basically-meaningless pleasantries dictated by polite society as being necessary in such situations, I extended my left arm (a little bit awkwardly, because there was a bone-sack in a white shirt with epaulettes impeding its progress through space and time, but mostly space), I placed my left (non-fapping, but I digress) hand’s opposable thumb - that thing which distinguishes a human from an ocelot, a giraffe, a badger, a Przewalski’s horse, a platypus, an echidna, or a cow that stands in the middle of a restaurant and recommends the best bits of itself to you for consideration as dinner (does fapping distinguish humans from other animals? I don’t know) - on the aft side of the left hand-grip on the captain’s control wheel and placed the four fingers on the forward side of the hand-grip (which is a long-winded way to say “I gripped the pilot’s control wheel”, but it wouldn’t be a Gertbengert Post^TM without a long and convoluted sentence, would it? Again, I digress - I would apologise, except for the fact that I am not sorry).

After doing the needful (a feat of the aircraft maintenance engineer’s art that took all of about two seconds) I said to the ~~Thompson twins~~ pilots, “fixed now”.

Pilots: “wait, wut?”

Me: [*explained my mad skillz using small words*]

Captain: “oh”

Me: “Safe flight guys”.

I exited the aircraft and walked back inside the hangar. 

&amp;nbsp;

“What did you do?” I hear you say. To quote Deane from *[The Curiosity Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curiosity_Show)*, “I’m glad you asked”. 

[Technical information: the crew of an aircraft typically wear headsets that allow them to communicate with each other on an intercom system and to communicate via radio with Air Traffic Control or whoever else they need to. The crew intercom is normally ‘hot microphone’ (just speak and the system takes care of the rest), while radio communications are ‘keyed mic’ (push a switch that changes the radio from Receive mode to Transmit mode and connects the headset microphone to the radio; release the switch when done talking, then headset microphone disconnects from radio and radio returns to Receive mode). On a walkie-talkie, the microphone key is typically on the side of the unit. Aircraft have a ‘push-to-talk’ switch on the control wheel (or the joystick, iffn’ that’s what the aircraft has). On this particular aircraft (and on thousands of others that have been built by the same manufacturer) each crew member’s microphone is controlled by a double-throw slide-switch that is configured ON-OFF-MOMENTARY ON. The pilot slides the switch from centre OFF to latched ON for crew intercom and usually leaves it in this position; if s/he wants to transmit on a radio, the pilot slides the switch through OFF to MOM. ON in order to engage the transmit function on the radio and to connect the headset microphone to the radio, then back to the latched ‘intercom’ position when transmissions are completed. Our antagonist Captain !Awesome (who was experienced on this type of aircraft and really should have known better) simply didn’t check the switch. I used my finger to slide the switch from the centre ‘off’ position to the ‘intercom’ position.“*This is Basil Exposition reporting; back to you in the studio*.”]

After I walked back in to the hangar, [Bossman] asked me what was the problem. 

Me: “The pilot’s a gumby drongo.”

I went back to my lunch; it hadn’t got cold. I resumed eating, serenaded by the spooling turbofans outside.

I think I'm the only person this has happened to.,"I have worked IT in a K-12 school district for the past five years. I have to preface the claim I am about to make with some background information about myself. I am a male in his 20's and am unfortunately overweight (I swear this is pertinent info). Our district has been deploying and repairing Chromebooks for our one to one device program for the past two years, so needless to say, we are pretty hands on with this particular device. 

The first of the happenings in this story came close to the beginning of one to one. I was quickly repairing a broken screen on a Chromebook. After verifying the replacement screen lit, I stood up and lifted the Chromebook to chest level to place it in the ""done"" pile. I gave the lid a satisfactory quick close for a job well done prior to setting it down. I really want to know what astronomical alignment happened at that moment, because as it became apparent in a few moments, my left manboob aligned my nipple right into the path of the rapidly closing lid. The Chromebook almost made the usual satisfying snap noise as the lid made contact with the body of the device. But this time it was slightly dampened. It felt like someone had stuck my manboob with a needle and the heat of it spread to the entirety of manboob. It took me a moment to realize what had happened. 

I had snapped a Chromebook closed on my nipple. The polo shirt I was wearing offered little protection. I winced but kept quiet because there were like three other people in the office. I told my co-worker later at lunch since we are pals and I had to share how I beat the odds and somehow injured myself with a Chromebook. He laughed but didn't tell the others, so I appreciate that. As for the nipple, it was inflamed for about a week.

This isn't the end of the story. Much time has passed and I all but forgot about my lesson of keeping rapidly closing devices at least a half foot from my manboobs. 

Well folks, lighting does strike twice. Only this time it was a Dell Latitude 5501 laptop and my right nipple.

Exempt Mr Bigshot,"Responded to an AskReddit with this story, and it was suggested it would fit in over here (fixed some formatting).

TL:DR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I work at my company's HQ. We support probably over a hundred users that have medium/high-profile articles written about them, plus their assistants &amp; interns.

For those unaware, Microsoft ended support for Windows 7 in January this year. For us folks in the industry, we knew well ahead of time and upgraded all machines to Windows 10 accordingly. I've been involved in W10 upgrade projects at other companies since 2017- across the board upgrading to Windows 10 has been **non-negotiable** once IT decides to make its move.

Current company decides at roughly the end of 2018 to start moving all remaining W7 machines to W10. Emails are sent to ALL employees, signed by CEO/CIO. This is coming from the top guys in our *entire industry*. We're having global IT meetings on Zoom every 2 weeks to discuss progress. Our office's remaining W7 numbers are going down- we're still sending emails every couple of weeks as a reminder to those who haven't switched that they need to coordinate with us to get it done.

  
Cue Mr. Bigshot who is *clearly* exempt. With 7 months to go, he starts emails my manager saying he can't move to W10 because his current setup is too specific, W10 is a PoS etc.  Manager replies stating this is non-negotiable, gives him the January deadline.

  
After he gets the next reminder email, Mr. Bigshot contacts his boss, says the same thing. Boss points out that the rest of their team has managed the switch, and that the top level of the company is asking this.

  
Next reminder, and he heads down to our in-house IT assistance and tells us he needs to speak to our manager and get exemption because, well, he's a Bigshot. Manager states exactly what was said in previous email.

  
We reach 2 months out. In our global IT meeting, we're told we can inform users their machines will be cut from the network if they don't make the switch. We're given the full backing from the top of the company to cut people off once January 14th 2020 hits.

Bigshot emails one of my coworkers to come up and speak to his admin. Admin explains Bigshot's exemption status. Coworker explains the cutoff threat.

  
It's the new year. Bigshot goes to the head of his department stating he is exempt. Dept. head asks CIO if there are exemptions. CIO is very clear.

  
It's Jan 14th, 2020. Coworker who spoke with Bigshot's admin pulls the plug. Bigshot's network access is gone. I'm at the in-house IT area. Bigshot's admin comes down and shows me the laptop, explaining he can't connect to the internet. I take one look at the machine, put on my ""I haven't heard that name in years"" face, and act super surprised that there's a computer still running W7, given how much of a security risk it is to the entire company, and that we've made IT's position very, VERY clear over the past 12 months. I tell her I HAVE to take the computer and upgrade it immediately. It's going to take the rest of the day and he'll get it back tomorrow. I call coworker over, and hand him the machine. Admin heads upstairs and explains to Bigshot.

Bigshot immediately complains to dept. head, who chastises him. Dept. head calls my manager to apologise, thank us for our patience, and gives us his full backing to do as needed with the machine.

  
I checked our ticket history yesterday- we haven't had a ticket from him in 9 months.

**TL:DR:** Bigshot thinks, despite numerous reminders for 12 months, that he's exempt from upgrading from Windows 7. Spoiler: &gt;!He isn't. Gets cutoff from company network.!&lt;",1294,0,1,"Exempt Mr Bigshot Responded to an AskReddit with this story, and it was suggested it would fit in over here (fixed some formatting).

TL:DR at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I work at my company's HQ. We support probably over a hundred users that have medium/high-profile articles written about them, plus their assistants &amp; interns.

For those unaware, Microsoft ended support for Windows 7 in January this year. For us folks in the industry, we knew well ahead of time and upgraded all machines to Windows 10 accordingly. I've been involved in W10 upgrade projects at other companies since 2017- across the board upgrading to Windows 10 has been **non-negotiable** once IT decides to make its move.

Current company decides at roughly the end of 2018 to start moving all remaining W7 machines to W10. Emails are sent to ALL employees, signed by CEO/CIO. This is coming from the top guys in our *entire industry*. We're having global IT meetings on Zoom every 2 weeks to discuss progress. Our office's remaining W7 numbers are going down- we're still sending emails every couple of weeks as a reminder to those who haven't switched that they need to coordinate with us to get it done.

  
Cue Mr. Bigshot who is *clearly* exempt. With 7 months to go, he starts emails my manager saying he can't move to W10 because his current setup is too specific, W10 is a PoS etc.  Manager replies stating this is non-negotiable, gives him the January deadline.

  
After he gets the next reminder email, Mr. Bigshot contacts his boss, says the same thing. Boss points out that the rest of their team has managed the switch, and that the top level of the company is asking this.

  
Next reminder, and he heads down to our in-house IT assistance and tells us he needs to speak to our manager and get exemption because, well, he's a Bigshot. Manager states exactly what was said in previous email.

  
We reach 2 months out. In our global IT meeting, we're told we can inform users their machines will be cut from the network if they don't make the switch. We're given the full backing from the top of the company to cut people off once January 14th 2020 hits.

Bigshot emails one of my coworkers to come up and speak to his admin. Admin explains Bigshot's exemption status. Coworker explains the cutoff threat.

  
It's the new year. Bigshot goes to the head of his department stating he is exempt. Dept. head asks CIO if there are exemptions. CIO is very clear.

  
It's Jan 14th, 2020. Coworker who spoke with Bigshot's admin pulls the plug. Bigshot's network access is gone. I'm at the in-house IT area. Bigshot's admin comes down and shows me the laptop, explaining he can't connect to the internet. I take one look at the machine, put on my ""I haven't heard that name in years"" face, and act super surprised that there's a computer still running W7, given how much of a security risk it is to the entire company, and that we've made IT's position very, VERY clear over the past 12 months. I tell her I HAVE to take the computer and upgrade it immediately. It's going to take the rest of the day and he'll get it back tomorrow. I call coworker over, and hand him the machine. Admin heads upstairs and explains to Bigshot.

Being asked to move tech to unprepared arieas.,"Ok for context I work for a school district and and am responsible for two elementaries. Both of them are currently under construction ex. network cabling not done, walls and drop ceilings torn apart, and power not run. One of the buildings is more complete than the other which is what I will be talking about here. (tech does not run network we have a vendor for this)

The main office is where the heavy construction is so the secretary and principle were moved to the music room. The building is getting a new music teacher and the principle wants me to move their setups back into the main office. Told her that if the construction is done I will be happy to do it

End of week comes and construction is still not done and still wants me to move tech. Once again told her that I could not since network is not run and there is no power. 

She bitches to my boss who sends out our network admin to setup a switch and pull the old network runs out of the ceiling crimp the cable. Switch wasn't even able to be powered. I set up the IP phone and left. 

I told her that I can not put a PC in this room if there is no power and will not be running extension cords since they will get in the way of construction. ""This is as far as I can go until construction is done.""

Music teacher is now coming the next day. Principle is now yelling at the workers running power to finish. Yelling at me to move tech even without power. 

I moved the secretary PC plugged everything in, laid the power cables on the desk, and left since my job was complete. Got a call from her about 5 minutes after I left for my other building bitching that the secretary couldn't use her desktop. Responded with ""Have her use her laptop that all staff members were supplied with until power is run."" 

Came back the next day and plugged everything in since power had been run. Now the secretary has the ability to sit next to workers actively drilling holes in concrete and the desk for cable runs.

Windows Issues...,"This story didn’t happen to me but to one of my fellow techs at the Point of Sale company I worked for back in the 90’s.

We were selling these massive digital cash registers. I don’t know how much they weighed but they were quite heavy. They were getting to the long end of their product cycle but we were still selling them. You could program well over 500 items into them but you did so using hexadecimal. A real pain to do at best.

We had sold one of these to a winery in an old two storey wooden building. The owner of the winery was never really happy with them but one day he finally had had enough. 

We got a call from him. Short and sweet “I want you to come up here and pick up your f\*\*\*ing machine” (click).

So the tech drives up and immediately sees the problem. The tasting room cash register is not in the tasting room on the second floor. 

No. 

Its right below a broken window with one corner of it buried about 6 inches into the lawn.

These machines were such a bitch to use that a grown man had gotten so frustrated he picked up this HEAVY machine and threw it THROUGH a closed window. I had been frustrated by these machines before, but that’s next level stuff there.

The tech, not being paid to risk life and limb, just picked up the machine and loaded it into his truck, checked the cash drawer to see if it was empty (it was), and headed back to the barn. 

Management thought about sending the sales guy back up there to see if they could patch over things, but the last time I was up at that winery the tasting room sales were just being given hand written receipts and the cash being put in a tin box.

The Cisco 7200VXR from HELL," Years ago, I was a network/sysadmin in the army.   I controlled, managed  and administrated a LAN/WAN configuration.

It happened on a Friday towards the end of the day. After trouble shooting the connection, I picked up the phone and called the NOC..

Me- This is SGT Bilkco from (location). There appears to be an issue with your 7200VXR in the rack.

NOC- Hold one, we'll jump into it and see what's going on.

NOC- er- there's seems to be an issue, we can't get into it (no shit).

Me- can you ping or trace route to it?

NOC- No. Your side is not responding to anything. We need to call Cisco support.

Me- That's fine.

(three way call. NOC, ME, Cisco support {CS})

Cisco determines that the problem is a failed motherboard.

CS- we need your credit card to secure a new motherboard.

Me- Why do  you need a credit card??

CS- To ensure the dead motherboard comes back.

Me- Listen here. We bought over 2 million dollars in new cisco equipment last year, I have a maintenance contract and a paid cisco partnership account. And you're giving me a hard time over a credit card???

CS- please hold. (CS goes silence and it's just me and the NOC now)

ME- WTF??! We spend a shit pot of money on Cisco equipment and now we're jacked around over a credit card???

NOC- yeah, makes you wonder.

Me- After this shit show is over, we're going 100% FOUNDRY EQUIPMENT!  CISCO CAN GO FUCK THEMSELVES!! I'M NOT BLOWING TAXPAYER MONEY ON SHITTY EQUIPMENT!!

(as soon as I threw this tirade out, CS comes back on the line instantly)

CS- SGT Bilko, we do not need a credit card to ship! We see you have a maintenance contract! The closest one is in Sydney! We'll overnight air! It will be there tomorrow morning!  

Me- Thank you.

CS- I think this ticket can be considered closed. Thank you for choosing Cisco, have a good day (click)

The dog (tech) ate (deleted) my homework,"So to help put myself through college, I worked as a Level I (and eventually Level II) tech for my university's on-campus, school-run tech support.  We were open from 12pm to 12am M-S, to accommodate college hours.

Most of the time, the jobs were pretty boring. Installing student printers in dorms, restocking the paper for the print labs, and the occasional 'I spilled 'water' on m computer and I have an paper due tomorrow, I need you to save my paper!!'

There's only one instance where I got suspended without pay.

Student walks in with some type of Windows PC and has a ton of viruses, no judgment on where he got them from. I decided the easiest thing to do would be to wipe the drive, reinstall Windows from scratch, and restore the files.  


Other issue is is the student came in at 11:58pm with a paper due that week. Not a problem, it isn't like the drive is toast - just enough viruses and trojanware to make doing any work impossible. But 2 minutes before close, I'm not sticking around to deal with this.  


This was a few years so we didn't have an online ticket system, everything was paper. On the check in ticket, we have a 'description of problem' box we fill out, and then a checklist of common issues: Backup Files, Wipe Drive, Reinstall OS, Restore Data, etc.  


It's late and I want to head home but tell the guy the tech that open the next day will be able to fix this no problem. I write ""wipe + restore data"" on the description, and check off the BACK UP FILES, WIPE DRIVE, REINSTALL OS, and RESTORE DATA checkboxes.   


I get a call the next day that I need to come in, immediately.  


The tech that opened the shop next day saw my ticket of ""wipe + restore data"", proceeded to wipe the drive, and then realized after the wipe that none of the data was backed up. The student lost their entire semester's worth of papers, including ones for exams that week.  


I was the ranking tech and the person who had written that tech, so my ass was the one that was sacrificed. My manager had to email the dean of students and every professor the student had a class with to explain the situation and request a continuance for the student, as most of the professors didn't believe our on-campus tech support would delete a student's paper.

Oops.",140,0,1,"The dog (tech) ate (deleted) my homework So to help put myself through college, I worked as a Level I (and eventually Level II) tech for my university's on-campus, school-run tech support.  We were open from 12pm to 12am M-S, to accommodate college hours.

Most of the time, the jobs were pretty boring. Installing student printers in dorms, restocking the paper for the print labs, and the occasional 'I spilled 'water' on m computer and I have an paper due tomorrow, I need you to save my paper!!'

There's only one instance where I got suspended without pay.

Student walks in with some type of Windows PC and has a ton of viruses, no judgment on where he got them from. I decided the easiest thing to do would be to wipe the drive, reinstall Windows from scratch, and restore the files.

I don't want an extra layer of security!,"Reposting this because it was removed for not containing story. I'm adding on a story of just one of these interactions.

For context, I work for an MSP with numerous support contracts. I am part of a team that is contracted to work onsite indefinitely at a large university, in their staff ICT support. They have their own in-house student ICT support.\[University\] has been rolling out a new Multi-Factor Authentication \[MFA\] system, due to some past cyber attacks (Read: Phishing, and dumb staff members that freely gave out their passwords). It's pretty simple, register on our web portal, and it links with the \[MFA\] app on your phone, or a rolling code hardware token if you don't have a compatible mobile. 

\*ETA\* I had forgotten to mention how the app works. YOu have the option of a push notification, which has accept or deny options on it, or, there's TOPT codes on the app, that refresh every 30 or so seconds. The hardware token is a OTP system as well, but it only generates and displays a code when you press the button on it.

I was in the test group, and have been enrolled in \[MFA\] since it's initial deployment. I have never had any issues. Now, this has not been mandatory yet, but heavy recommended. We've had quite a few staff enroll, with minimal issues. Some hiccups here and there, but that's to be expected. Now, recently, there's been some emails going out to all staff with information surrounding \[MFA\] including links to articles on what it's about, and how to enroll. You see, we're making it mandatory in a few weeks (With some exceptions on a case-by-case basis, but the staff don't know that).

Cue the influx of staff calling the service desk:

""Are these emails legitimate? It looks like spam""

""What exactly is \[MFA\]? Why do I need it""

""How do I enroll in \[MFA\]?""""I don't have a smart phone""  

""My phone is too old/not compatible""

""This adds an extra step into my routine, it's so inconvenient!""

""I enrolled in \[MFA\], now \[Completely unrelated system\] is not working! It's all your fault""

Story time!

Here's one particular interaction I had with a very... snobbish staff member. Not many people like dealing with this guy, as he comes off as an ""I know more than you"" type of person, and doesn't tolerate anyone who is not self-confident enough.

**SU** = Snobby user

**ME** = Well, me.

We had just finished rounding off a ticket where he reported a (legitimate) security concern he had regarding his account. Our primary recommendations were to change his password and enroll in \[MFA\]. He was not thrilled.

**SU:** So, as far as \[MFA\] is concerned, it will not work for me from home, because I have no cell signal. None. Zero. That will cause a major problem if I need to work from home.

**ME:** Well, you do not need to rely on cell signal, as it runs through a mobile app, which can run fine over WiFi, which you are using for your laptop at home.

**SU:** Oh. I had not considered that an app is required. To be honest, I do not trust most apps for security and stability reasons. What are the OS version limits?

**ME:** *\*gives version compatibility limits\**

**SU:** Well, I only have \[OS version lower than the minimum required, which is 4 years old\]

**ME:** Since your device is not compatible, we will need to issue you a hardware token *\*Gives detailed info on how these work\**

**SU:** I assume the dongle will be USB-C? (User has a laptop that only has USB-C ports). Do I need to switch the dongle to whatever computer I am using? Say, for example, I am in a hotel lobby in \[Country on the other side of the world\], can I use this same dongle?

**ME:** This token is not a dongle. It is a self-contained device that generates a code when you press the button, which you then enter into the prompt on your computer.

**SU:** Ah, I've seen these before. They use Bluetooth, correct?

**ME:** No, they do not have any connection of any kind to any other device. They are fully self-contained. They have a button, and a screen which displays the code.

**SU:** Okay, one last question. What happens if the battery runs flat? Say I am overseas, about to go into a meeting, and it is 3am \[local time of University\]. How can I get access when no code is generated?

**ME:** Unfortunately, these are sealed units with un-replaceable batteries. The battery, however, is designed to last 5-7 years with average usage. If you are concerned that it will run dry, you can replace it, say, every 3-4 years.

**SU:** Okay, so there's no guarantee it won't fail, and there's no warning before it fails. The takeaway from this is that I will not enroll in \[MFA\]. Thank you. *\*Reminder, \[MFA\] will become mandatory\**

I promptly sent that ticket over to my team lead, as I was sure there would be a complaint incoming, and was told not to worry about it. My team lead told me I had the patience of a saint in answering his questions, even he wouldn't have been able to make it that far.

The General's Laptop..," Note- I promise to not make any snarky comments about the ""children"" and their melt-downs.

 This  happened in 2002-2003 time frame. There I was.. A Army systems  admin wearing many hats. Knee deep in green-bar print outs, Windows 95  floppy disks, old Cisco network equipment and balls of CAT-5 cable.   (sorry.. no brass, no ammo in this story.   Yep. Some brass, like the  officer kind AGAIN) 

I got a special request once. The general wants to move from a desktop to a laptop. He wants everything to be EXACTLY the way it was on his desktop, to include how his files are laid out, the background, etc. Keywords to this (3 times) EXACTLY. 

I was given the laptop. I took it from bare bones to standard and added it to the network. I then copied (remotely) everything from his desktop to his laptop and arranged it EXACTLY as it was on his desktop. This was before CAC card days. How to ensure it was EXACT? Easy, change the general's password and login as him (with his permission). Logged into his desktop remotely and his laptop sitting on my bench at the same time and arrange everything so it was mirrored perfectly. The job was done it was EXACTLY as he wanted it. I was getting ready to take it over when...

The little brown nosing boss decided HE needed to take it over and set it up for the general.  I told him this was a General-to-Bilko project with no deviations. (warning- inbound shit show)

Two hours later..  My phone rings..

(little boss = LB)

Me- Networking, SGT Bilko speaking.

LB- I'm here in the general's office and this laptop is not working!

Me- It worked when it was on my bench, what did you do?

LB- I plugged it in and there is no networking!

Me- (knowing the general's office and knowing the jacks behind the typewriter desk were the original CAT3 phone wire from when the building was built) Where did you plug the network cable in at....?

LB- behind the typewriter desk!

Me- and you did not use the patch cable that was there for the desktop that was plugged into another jack...?

LB- No! I cut that one up and threw it in the trash.

Me- (banging head against hard flat surface) OK. I'll be over to make a new patch cable and we'll get this done.

I head to the general's office. The general is pissed. He gave this job to me, but little boss decided he would look awesome by taking it over and setting it up. He's pissed that a major wasted 2 hours of his time.

I make a new patch cable and started to plug it into the correct jack....

LB- I don't want to use that jack, I want the one behind the typewriter desk.

Me- it's CAT3 phone wire. It was never intended to be a network jack.

LB- I want it re-wired right now!

Me- Oooook. Let me get the ladders, a spool of CAT5 and pop the ceiling tiles in the CSM's office and 3  COL's offices to get to the signal closet. This is going to take a couple hours.

LB- NO! I want it done right NOW!

Me- No. This is a 2-3 hour job. You need to go to each affected office and let them know I'll be moving ceiling tiles and they'll need to leave.

LB- NO! I want it done now!

Me- (to LB) OK. You have a choice- 2-3hrs of ceiling tiles or this patch cable. What's it going to be?

General- Patch cable. Get it hooked up and get out. 

(LB leaves)

I plugged in the cable, had networking, showed the general his layout and had him change his password.  I apologized to the general for the actions of my little boss.

I Want YOU to fix it,"my first post on this sub.... short and sweet.


I was on the network support team at a retail giant in Canada.  
A ticket came into our queue about an unreachable server issue.     I checked the network and all connectivity was there, so I updated the ticket indicating the network checks out, that the issue requires server support, and then pushed the ticket to the server support queue.   

Big mistake.

I laughed, explained what a network was, and what a server was.    He didn't want to hear it and demanded that I fix the issues.

The Noise,"As I pull into the parking lot on this crisp autumn morning I see a class out on the playground having just the best time ever. I thought it was kind of weird because this isn't anywhere close to any recess times and they sure haven't earned any extra recesses yet this year. Not that it really matters to me, but I just thought it was a bit weird as I was pulling into my parking spot.

I walk in the door and the first thing that greets me is Titanium Trevor. Titanium Trevor is the school resource officer that is literally half titanium alloy or aluminum at this point due to an absurd number of surgeries he's had - a brisk walk would outpace his run. Even more unfortunate is that he is wildly inappropriate and cannot take a hint. I'd honestly rather suck-start a shotgun than listen to another word he says. So of course he's in the lobby to greet me and says ""man you're starting off with a good mornin' aren't ya?""

""Every morning is a good morning, Trevor."" I reply as I brush him off to quickly punch in at the time clock.

""They say it's one of your wires coming out of that ceiling that's making the noise""

""Who is they and what wire and what noise?""

""Oh, didn't they call you?""

""No?""

""Well apparently there's one of your wires in Harris's room that's making some loud noise or somethin'.""

""...what wire of mine could POSSIBLY be making noise?""

""I don't know man that's just what they said.""

""Who is they???""

""Harris I guess. Brother I don't know I'm just tellin' ya what they told me.""

""Fine. Let me set my stuff down first.""

We walk down there and sure enough there's a pretty loud noise. It sounds like one of the bells on the intercom system got stuck in the ""on"" position.. except it's not coming from the intercom. It's coming from the opposite side of the room. The same side of the room as ""the wire"".

My first and really only mistake was listening to them instead of just doing my own investigation. I begin looking where they said it was coming from (the rapid run audio/video cable that you use connect a DVD player up to the projector). Yeah, it's a bit louder in that area, but there's no way in hell it's making this loud of a sound.

I get my sciatic-nerve-on-fire-half-my-leg-and-foot-numb self on a table because Titanium Trevor is just standing there completely uselessly. I begin to pop open a couple ceiling tiles and determine that the noise is for sure not coming from ""the wire"" nor the ceiling. I begin to think that it's a bit louder by some wall powered microscopes (this is in a science classroom) they have set up on a table so I start unplugging anything in the area and the noise just isn't going away.

I tell Titanium Trevor to just stay here (basically keep doing what he's already doing so expertly) and that I'm going to start flipping breakers to see if we have some insane interference being caused by God knows what. I flip all the breakers for that room and it's still as loud as ever. I limp back down there and begin to just listen.

As I'm just using my ears to navigate (much like Bird Box) I'm cancelling out the incredible echoes of the noise and Titanium Trevor's incessant rambling. I'm honing in on the target. But as I dial myself in I begin to feel an overwhelming wave of regret. I know what's happening. I did this to myself. I'm becoming self aware - self aware of the fact that I assumed that they knew what they were talking about.

I listen. I listen hard. I divert all non-critical sensory input to my ears. Taste? Not important. Smell? Not important. Touch? Maybe. I'll leave a small reserve in that tank. After channeling and redirecting my sensory abilities I'm being driven toward the ground. It's low. Is it one of those prank noise makers? Did a kid pull a genius stunt to get a free 30 minute recess? I begin to check under tables. The first table isn't right, the noise isn't loud enough. The second table nearby is loud. I mean LOUD. But it isn't coming from the underside of the table. It's even lower than that. It's coming from the ground where all the... backpacks... are... The blue backpack on the ground. It's coming from the blue backpack. I pick it up and the noise follows the backpack upward. It's inside.

I don't know if I'm allowed to go through a child's belongings so Titanium Trevor does the only useful thing he's done all morning and opens the backpack up. The noise is infinitely louder. He begins taking things out one by one until finally... the metronome. It's a band kid's metronome. It's a kid's metronome that they evacuated the classroom for. It's a kid's metronome that was the cause of the class being out on the playground as I pulled into the parking lot. It's a metronome that they blamed on ""my"" wire. It's a metronome that neither the 30 kids, nor the teacher, nor any other adult at the school bothered to put in any effort to find. 

They lost an entire class period's worth of learning over a metronome, in a child's backpack, that had nothing to do with the Technology Department.",178,0,1,"The Noise As I pull into the parking lot on this crisp autumn morning I see a class out on the playground having just the best time ever. I thought it was kind of weird because this isn't anywhere close to any recess times and they sure haven't earned any extra recesses yet this year. Not that it really matters to me, but I just thought it was a bit weird as I was pulling into my parking spot.

I walk in the door and the first thing that greets me is Titanium Trevor. Titanium Trevor is the school resource officer that is literally half titanium alloy or aluminum at this point due to an absurd number of surgeries he's had - a brisk walk would outpace his run. Even more unfortunate is that he is wildly inappropriate and cannot take a hint. I'd honestly rather suck-start a shotgun than listen to another word he says. So of course he's in the lobby to greet me and says ""man you're starting off with a good mornin' aren't ya?""

""Every morning is a good morning, Trevor."" I reply as I brush him off to quickly punch in at the time clock.

""They say it's one of your wires coming out of that ceiling that's making the noise""

""Who is they and what wire and what noise?""

""Oh, didn't they call you?""

""No?""

""Well apparently there's one of your wires in Harris's room that's making some loud noise or somethin'.""

""...what wire of mine could POSSIBLY be making noise?""

""I don't know man that's just what they said.""

""Who is they???""

""Harris I guess. Brother I don't know I'm just tellin' ya what they told me.""

""Fine. Let me set my stuff down first.""

We walk down there and sure enough there's a pretty loud noise. It sounds like one of the bells on the intercom system got stuck in the ""on"" position.. except it's not coming from the intercom. It's coming from the opposite side of the room. The same side of the room as ""the wire"".

My first and really only mistake was listening to them instead of just doing my own investigation. I begin looking where they said it was coming from (the rapid run audio/video cable that you use connect a DVD player up to the projector). Yeah, it's a bit louder in that area, but there's no way in hell it's making this loud of a sound.

I get my sciatic-nerve-on-fire-half-my-leg-and-foot-numb self on a table because Titanium Trevor is just standing there completely uselessly. I begin to pop open a couple ceiling tiles and determine that the noise is for sure not coming from ""the wire"" nor the ceiling. I begin to think that it's a bit louder by some wall powered microscopes (this is in a science classroom) they have set up on a table so I start unplugging anything in the area and the noise just isn't going away.

I tell Titanium Trevor to just stay here (basically keep doing what he's already doing so expertly) and that I'm going to start flipping breakers to see if we have some insane interference being caused by God knows what. I flip all the breakers for that room and it's still as loud as ever. I limp back down there and begin to just listen.

As I'm just using my ears to navigate (much like Bird Box) I'm cancelling out the incredible echoes of the noise and Titanium Trevor's incessant rambling. I'm honing in on the target. But as I dial myself in I begin to feel an overwhelming wave of regret. I know what's happening. I did this to myself. I'm becoming self aware - self aware of the fact that I assumed that they knew what they were talking about.

I listen. I listen hard. I divert all non-critical sensory input to my ears. Taste? Not important. Smell? Not important. Touch? Maybe. I'll leave a small reserve in that tank. After channeling and redirecting my sensory abilities I'm being driven toward the ground. It's low. Is it one of those prank noise makers? Did a kid pull a genius stunt to get a free 30 minute recess? I begin to check under tables. The first table isn't right, the noise isn't loud enough. The second table nearby is loud. I mean LOUD. But it isn't coming from the underside of the table. It's even lower than that. It's coming from the ground where all the... backpacks... are... The blue backpack on the ground. It's coming from the blue backpack. I pick it up and the noise follows the backpack upward. It's inside.

I don't know if I'm allowed to go through a child's belongings so Titanium Trevor does the only useful thing he's done all morning and opens the backpack up. The noise is infinitely louder. He begins taking things out one by one until finally... the metronome. It's a band kid's metronome. It's a kid's metronome that they evacuated the classroom for. It's a kid's metronome that was the cause of the class being out on the playground as I pulled into the parking lot. It's a metronome that they blamed on ""my"" wire. It's a metronome that neither the 30 kids, nor the teacher, nor any other adult at the school bothered to put in any effort to find.

But the power adapters looked the same....,"I was at our panel beaters the other day when he asked if I could look at the DVR for his CCTV cameras as it wasn't recording.

So I got both DVRs and tried them, swapped HDDs etc but no go. Then I realized I hadn't heard the drives spin up.  

Hmmm maybe a crook drive had gone dead short and fried something in both DVRs? Cracked out the multimeter and measured voltages on the SATA power lead. 5VDC, and ~~12VDC~~ 8.35VDC. Thats not right!

Turns out they'd come in one morning and found the DVR dead, no lights etc so they swapped the power pack for one that had **physically** identical specs but different voltage rating.

"""What part of 'I'm calling CID and having you arrested' did you not understand?"""," Note- This would have been posted at [r/MilitaryStories](https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/), but politics got in the way.

This  happened in 2002-2003 time frame. There I was.. A Army systems admin wearing many hats. Knee deep in green-bar print outs, Windows 95 floppy disks, old Cisco network equipment and balls of CAT-5 cable.  (sorry.. no brass, no ammo in this story.   Yep. Some brass, like the officer kind AGAIN)

The help desk gets a call from a remote installation, they unsure how to fulfill the request, so they passed it over to me.  This was an interesting conversation that deals with network ownership and who is responsible for it. Our officer of the day is Major MCP (microsoft certified professional). He held an MCP at the time, but did not hold signal branch or assigned a billet in the IT field.

me- Networking, SGT Bilko speaking.

MCP- This is Major MCP. I was passed over to you from the help desk to get something resolved.

me- Sure sir, what do you need help with?

MCP- I need the IP scope of my building so I can configure and install a linksys wireless router.

me-  That's not happening.

MCP- why not? It's my building, I can do what I want with it. Besides, I'm a MCP.

me- Ok sir.. Let me help you out. First off, the network is my responsibility; not yours. Second, this is a DOD network, we don't install wireless routers because you want one (at the time, there were NO wireless networking of any kind). To install one would be considered a breach of security.

MCP- I know what I'm doing, I'm an MCP. What are you? Just a lowly E5? You need to hand over the IP information so I can get this wireless router installed. I'm an officer, you're just a peon enlisted. You do what I order. (DOH! he really stepped in that one!)

me- OK sir. I guess breach of a DOD network went over the top of your head. Should I put you on hold and call CID (Criminal Investigation Division) to have you arrested now, or later? Your choice.  BTW- I OWN this network, you do not.  I don't give two sh!ts if you're an MCP or not. You are a guest on my network, I don't work for you, nor are you part of my chain of command. What you are ordering is illegal and a felony. Better yet! Let me call CID and I'll drive down with them and I'll camcorder your arrest!

Boss- I can't believe that idiot!

me- it takes all sorts, sir. Do I need to call CID?

Boss- No. I told him if you find any router or rogue device of any kind on their subnet, that you will be taking their subnet offline until a team can be sent down there to ensure there are no other rogue devices on that subnet.

The Phantom Terminal,"Caveat:  English is my first language, so I have no excuse.  Enjoy the charm of bizarre syntax.

Once upon a time (I have to start this way since it harkens back into the mists of computerology) there was an organization that brought up a new system, a very complex system with tons of data.  It provided a new way of putting more information into the system as well as retrieving needed information.  

This was a mainframe-based system with a single location on the continent.  On this continent were I-forget-how-many offices that were served, but it was at least in the mid-hundreds, and each office had multiple users.  So, thousands of terminals.  

You might imagine what it takes to purchase and install thousands of terminals as simultaneously as possible.  Not to mention training the staff which uses them on the system and software that they need.  These systems replaced an extremely complicated paper function that required sending lots of paper daily.  Believe me, as expensive a project as it was, it probably saved enough money in postage over five years to pay for itself.  

The goal, of course, was to put a terminal on the desk of every employee who **needed** one.  There were literally no spares at the time of initial installation.  

Cue a district office manager.  His function did not warrant a terminal, so there was not one placed upon his desk.  Fuss and bother resulted, but there was not a terminal to spare for him even if he could have used it, which he couldn’t.  He was way too busy to learn how.  Not to mention that his function did not require directly accessed information or the ability to enter information into the system.  Of course.  

Fuss and bother escalates but does not cause another terminal to magically appear.  Manager has furrowed brow.  Techs are getting surly.  The system comes up continent-wide and magically works.  (The number of virgins sacrificed to make this possible I am loathe to admit.)  Manager now has extremely high blood pressure but does not physically explode like people are hoping.  

Something had to be done, and one person finally came up with a solution.  

They still had no terminals to spare, but they had an older terminal from a prior decade that had a crt but no other innards.  They polished this one up and, waiting until a day when manager was not in the office, delivered it to his office together with a keyboard.  They figured it was going to be a while before manager tried to use it and discovered it did not even turn on, much less work.  Maybe by that time they would have spares to substitute for terminals in for repair, and they could finally give him one of those.  

Manager returns to office and finds his tantrums have finally resulted in a terminal appearing on his desk.  Techs wait and wait for his call that it did not work.  Years pass, manager retires, and no call was ever made.

Self-confident customer steals my time with an actually small mistake.,"**Long story short:** customer was too self-confident to see his mistake and therefore gave relevant information too late.

&amp;#x200B;

I manage the complaints department of a manufacturer of engine components. Part of my job is to check components, write reports and look after customers over the phone.

A customer called that an electrical component on his turbocharger did not respond. These turbochargers are mostly remanufactured parts. Small mistakes can creep in, but they are rare. It is even rarer that the error occurs 3 times.

According to his item number, I sent him the electrical part individually.

Two days later he reports that he had got the wrong part, the plug would be a bit different. It came out that he had a different part number than indicated. Again sent out the component with the other connector.

Two days later he reports again, the connector fits, but the component does not respond. He sends a picture of the old part that was originally installed. It's a completely different one! Find the original part number with the VIN. The customer needs a completely different turbocharger, all parts and the charger work, just not in his vehicle.

Customer says he has the part number from website x because website y is too complicated and often swaps numbers. Side x is the only side that swapped the numbers in this case.  
(Edit: The car manufacturer gives a part an original part number. Then comes the aftermarket and produces spare parts with their own numbers. And there are many websites to link those numbers. And some swap some numbers )

&gt; When did this start? Noon

(call up eventviewer and see the startup. Don't see a shutdown. But that suggests a hard stop. Start up indicated that was starting from a failure.)

&gt; Did you shut down? Yes

&gt; Today? Yes

&gt; When? When the computer stopped working (remember, users lie)

&gt; You went to the shutdown menu and had the computer shut down? No, why should I. It was shutdown.

&gt; But you said you just shut it down? Well.....

&gt; When did you last shut it down using the menu? Last night

(go to the logs... Was put to sleep, not shutdown)

&gt; You never chose to do a proper shutdown when you got it back up today? No, I was using it (remember, was doing nothing when it shutdown, users lie.)

&gt; Please do a proper shutdown using the menu. (watch spouse do this.)

&gt; Start it back up and tell me it it happens again.

Thankfully, even though our marriage showed some cracks there, I think that I skirted the major breaks there. But it was clear that users lie, even if they think they are telling the truth."
Nobody pressed the button,"[u/dhgaut's story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ixqwa1/assuming_the_user_knows_something_is_a_mistake/) reminded me of one I experienced, not with lies but with general uselessness.

I've written this before as a comment, but as far as I can tell never as an actual post.  I used to be a local tech for a copy/print/ship company, the one with an arrow in their logo.  This takes place a little more than a decade ago, I was assigned an area in Downtown Los Angeles and covered multiple stores in the area.  One Friday afternoon my boss calls me while I'm at my main office in the middle of Downtown LA.

&gt; Boss:  ""Hey what's your schedule look like?  I may need your help at [not your location], they're having a network issue.

&gt; Me:  ""Nothing really.  What's going on?""

&gt; Boss:  ""[not your location] has an issue where all their computers connected to [VLAN] are down.  I told the manager to call the help desk and get a ticket opened but he hasn't done it yet and I'm not doing anything until he does what I told him to do.""

Time passes and I send a few emails to my boss asking for an update because traffic starts to suck at around 3.  It would take me anywhere from 1.5 hours to 2 hours to get home and [not my location] was double the distance past my home.  Finally close to 4 my boss calls me.

&gt; Boss:  ""OK they got a ticket finally and I'm pretty sure I know what the problem is.  They're just refusing to follow my directions.  The switch for [VLAN] needs to be rebooted and they won't do it.""

&gt; Me:  ""Are you approving overtime?  It's going to take me hours just to drive out there.""

&gt; Boss:  ""No, go first thing Monday.  Their fault for not listening to me and refusing to do a simple task.""

Back then the stores had 4 separate VLAN's, each running on its own switch.  Except for [VLAN], if you were an older store they repurposed a 3com 10base hub which originally had been the only network device for the whole store (installed somewhere between Fall 1997 and Spring 1998).

Monday I drive out to [not my location] and arrive around 9am.  They've got a barricade of trash cans blocking the area where customers can use computers, which all are on [VLAN].  I go introduce myself to the Assistant Manager and she gets the key to the network closet.  Their network closet was a decent sized room, three 2-post racks with the switches all mounted in the center one.

I don't even need to flip on the lights to see all 24 lights on the 3com are solid.  No flashing, solid LED lights, this location does not have 24 devices plugged in so at least half of those should be off.  I turn on the lights, walk around the racks, go to the back of the hub and press the red reset button next to the power cable.  I walk back around and see the hub power cycling, hear the fans spinning up and then the lights start flashing for the ports that have devices plugged in.

I go back out and check the computers, sure enough everything is starting to pop back online.  I go over to the Assistant Manager and let her know everything is fixed.  She asks me to show her what I did so I walk her back to the network room and show her the button I pressed.

&gt; Assistant Manager:  ""That's it?  That's all someone had to do to fix it?""

&gt; Me:  ""Yes, that's the reset button.  It just needed a reset.  Someone could've unplugged the power cord and plugged it back in to fix it too.""

She started laughing and let me know that when she left on Friday afternoon the manager was handling it and he told everyone to not touch anything.  I called my boss and told him I pushed the little red button and he laughed and grumbled.  Apparently he told the manager and another assistant manager to push the button on Friday afternoon.",1372,0,1,"Nobody pressed the button [u/dhgaut's story](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ixqwa1/assuming_the_user_knows_something_is_a_mistake/) reminded me of one I experienced, not with lies but with general uselessness.

Close it when you are done.,"I was home for the holidays a few years back when my mom mentioned that the internet on her work phone seemed to be a bit slow. She worked for her state government and they had just switched everyone off of blackberries for the first time. 

I went to check her phone and found 34 open internet tabs. I asked her if she really needed all those and she asked what a tab was! She had kept opening new tabs assuming that each time she did so the old one closed. I showed her how to close them and she sheepishly thanked me.

This is but one of MANY stories about this woman interacting with technology.

Where does the USB go?,"I do all the tech stuff for my parents business (my career is in engineering but I have a webdev/it background).  I live in another city several hours away from their business.  My parents and their staff are all very tech illiterate.

When a problem occurs, usually I can remote in and fix the issue.  However sometimes the issue is hardware related and I have to be onsite to fix it.  I don't want to drive 2 hours to fix a problem if I don't have to, so first I try to walk the staff through the troubleshooting over the phone.

Last week I get an emergency call saying the POS (point of sale) computer can't connect to the server (thus the pos software won't load).  (OH BOY, that sounds like a fun problem to solve! /s)  So I call up the staff and talk to one of the employees who gives me the run down.  I remote in and determine the router/modem is defective, then contact the ISP to get a tech out to replace it.  The tech can't come for a few days and without the POS software, the staff would be forced to write down all the sales (and enter them into the POS when the connection is back up).

The server is just a separate pc running windows and it is located in a secure location within the business.  To save the staff some time, I figure I'd have them locate the server pc, unplug it (only power and ethernet) and hook it up next to the main work station so they could access the POS software/db directly.  This ends up working fine and they are able to enter all the sales normally.

Eventually the tech comes in and replaces the modem.  So I call the staff and tell them to put the server back where they found it and rehook up the pos workstation.  Several hours pass and I haven't heard a response from them, so I assume that everything went well.

The next day I get a call that the mouse and keyboard don't work, but the workstation computer turns on/boots.  So I ask them if they reconnected all the cables.  None of the employees understand what I mean, so I get them to take a photo of the rear of the workstation with their cellphone.  Nothing but the monitor and power are plugged into the PC!  (And it turns out they didn't move the server until the end of the day, gave up trying to rehook up the workstation, then all went home.)

I call them and ask why they didn't hook up the rest of the cables (ethernet, multiple usb).  They tell me that they didn't know where those cables went and were afraid of making a mistake by plugging them into the wrong holes.  I kindly explain how to plug them in.  Everything works and I hang up.

So here I am wondering, how do they not know where the usb goes?  Have these people never used a usb before (ie. power their cellphone, use a usb memory card, etc)?  Certainly being tech illiterate doesn't mean you become brain dead when you see a piece of technology does it?

I think of that game toddlers play where they have a box with different shapes and have to stick the triangle in the triangle hole, the square in the square hole, etc.  Then I think of the staff - they look at the back of the computer - there are 6 rectangle usb slots and 1 square ethernet slot.  Should it not be simple to figure this out?

Tight Yorkshire man.,"For those who don't know, folks from Yorkshire have a reputation for being very careful with their money. By this time I was working on electron microscopes for a large Japanese company (still am in fact). Anyway, let's get to the story.

So I'm sitting in the office when a call comes in from a user of one of our machines. He had the same system for over 20 years and it was the only one of its kind in the UK. In all that time he had never had a service contract nor asked us to work on any issue. Fair enough; he was a competent user and had enough informed people around him to keep it running. Being a tightwad Yorkshireman he also objected to spending money on such fripperies as service contracts.

So the call starts off with him virtually demanding a replacement air valve for this ancient and unique machine. I promised to call him back after I had identified the part and located one. That set me off on a few hours of fruitless searching. Of course we didn't have the part ourselves so I took to calling around pneumatic suppliers all over the country. The usual reaction was laughter and disbelief that someone still used these old valves.

Finally one of these companies suggested replacing the entire valve block and manifold with modern equipment that matched the required specs. It seemed reasonable to me and they offered the whole kit at a very cheap price. I called him back and the convo went something like this.

Me ""I'm sorry Mr. X but these valves have been out of production for nearly 2 decades and we have none in our world wide stock. I've also called many suppliers and they also confirm nil stock.""

X ""Well what am I supposed to do? This is bloody terrible customer service"" . Says the man who hadn't spent a bent penny with us for 20 years.

Me ""We do have the option to replace entire valve bank with modern valves and it'll only cost 200 pounds""

X ""200 bloody quid! That's a bloody ripoff. I'll sort myself out thanks"" and hangs up.

I've no idea how he resolved it and frankly I don't give a bugger.",1159,0,1,"Tight Yorkshire man.

Being “monitored”,"So this is going to be a funny post for some good humor/laugh.

Today at work, had a ticket for a user that was having a monitor issue. The user couldn’t get windows to recognize new monitor. I saw that the only two were working. One is the laptop lcd screen. They other two are external. I checked the cables and everything was good. I saw under the display settings that the new monitor was “disconnected”. I extended all screens and it worked. Issue resolved. 

The user had two older monitors that were made in 2012. These two monitors don’t have 1080p. So they aren’t very useful with the resolution.

I took each monitor back to our lab to be disposed later. As I was taking the last one, one of the security guards asked/said, “you know you’re being ‘monitored.’  I said, “yep.”",344,0,1,"Being “monitored” So this is going to be a funny post for some good humor/laugh.

Prosecution presents into evidence exhibit A: bloddy glass and exhibit B: an ass print,"Yes, I know the title is misspelled... roast away

TL: DR at bottom

This story involves the same school district as my last story. This time it was the high school with the issue.

Think this was early 2010’s when this story happened. The office received a call Monday morning asking for a tech to come down and check a couple of machines that had been vandalized over the weekend. Apparently a couple teenagers broke into the one supply room and trashed a copier and a duplicator. Lucky me got the job.

I arrive and am shown the disaster zone. The duplicator was scrap, it got shoved down a winding stair case and was utterly destroyed. Looked like they went to each landing and kept kicking it down the stairs till it hit bottom, there was ink EVERYWHERE, thank God I didn’t have to clean that up but I do feel for the janitor that did. On to the copier, the document glass was broken, the control panel had had soda poured on it, orange judging by the color and smell, and the front cover/door was broken off. I proceed to pick all the glass out of the optics section, there was a couple pieces that had blood on it so I set those aside. I pulled the control panel off and took it all apart, cleaned all the contacts and switches, got all the stickiness off the panel and buttons, and then put it back on. I tricked the door actuator just to get the machine powered on to what all error codes showed up. Multiple jams throughout the machine so I go fishing, jams in the side, under the drum and one about three quarters of the way through the fuser. Now if you read the title I’m sure you all know what was on the print sitting in the fuser, I nice clear ass print. My guess is whoever broke the copier was making a copy of their butt and was hopping off the glass when the glass broke, cutting up their butt, the front cover got knocked open and broken off when they were getting off the machine. They probably poured soda on the controls thinking it’d kill the machine, again I’m just guessing. I toss the “evidence” into a clear paper protector to keep the bottom section from smearing toner and put the bloody glass in a zip lock bag and start closing up the machine to see what works if anything. Amazingly the copier still “worked” the start button worked but the touch panel and other sections were fried. You could put something in the document feeder and it would make a single copy of what you put in, the doc feeder uses a small strip of glass of to the side and it was still intact. And everything internally was fine other than needing a new front door/cover. I write up what all the machine needs and head to the office with evidence in tow.

M: Our intrepid tech who has seen way to many stupid things to be surprised by any of this
S: Secretary
P: Principal

M: Ok, good news and bad news. The duplicator is not even worth looking at but the copier is salvageable with some parts and TLC.

S: Oh good we were hoping it wouldn’t be a complete loss. The principal wanted to talk to you once you were done, let me get him.

About 5 minutes pass and the secretary shows me to the principals office

P: So what’s the situation, I’m going to need estimates on repairs. We think we know who did it but are still looking into it.

I explained what all was wrong with the copier and duplicator.

P: Ok, just estimate a whole new control panel, insurance will be coving it if we don’t catch who did it, but if we do their parents will be.

M: Ok, that won’t be a problem, I have some “evidence” that may help you figure out who did it.

P: Evidence?

I showed him the bloody glass and then the butt print.

P: Oh my God… Well that should help, I think… Thanks for taking a look at things, can you email me the estimate here and he handed me a business card.

M: Sure thing

After I got back to the shop I emailed the estimate and we got the go ahead within a couple of days to fix the copier. I got to go back and fix everything up about a two weeks later, had some interesting news when I got done with repairs and went to get paperwork signed.

M: Morning P, everything is all fixed up. How’d you make out with your investigation.

P: Oh it was quite interesting. We had a couple students in with their parents asking them questions. The kids were denying everything till I brought up the bloody glass and the butt print. The one boy’s parents immediately started yelling at him. I guess he lied and made up some excuse why he needed to have some stiches in his butt. His dad went ballistic and said he’d be paying for everything if he didn’t fess up and say who was all involved. Turns out it was the two other boys there and one other who didn’t get caught. The others confirmed and the parents ended up having to split the bill. I could hear the parents yelling on the way out that the kids were making up for every penny they had to pay for their stupidity.

M: Well I’m glad you caught who did it. You have a good day and thanks for the laugh.

Wish I could have been a fly on the wall when that all went down.

TL: DR – Some idiots high schoolers broke in to their school and broke some equipment. One of them broke the copier and cut his butt making copies and then had to get stiches. They got caught after the principal brought up the butt print and broken glass.

I arrive and am shown the disaster zone. The duplicator was scrap, it got shoved down a winding stair case and was utterly destroyed. Looked like they went to each landing and kept kicking it down the stairs till it hit bottom, there was ink EVERYWHERE, thank God I didn’t have to clean that up but I do feel for the janitor that did. On to the copier, the document glass was broken, the control panel had had soda poured on it, orange judging by the color and smell, and the front cover/door was broken off. I proceed to pick all the glass out of the optics section, there was a couple pieces that had blood on it so I set those aside. I pulled the control panel off and took it all apart, cleaned all the contacts and switches, got all the stickiness off the panel and buttons, and then put it back on. I tricked the door actuator just to get the machine powered on to what all error codes showed up. Multiple jams throughout the machine so I go fishing, jams in the side, under the drum and one about three quarters of the way through the fuser. Now if you read the title I’m sure you all know what was on the print sitting in the fuser, I nice clear ass print. My guess is whoever broke the copier was making a copy of their butt and was hopping off the glass when the glass broke, cutting up their butt, the front cover got knocked open and broken off when they were getting off the machine. They probably poured soda on the controls thinking it’d kill the machine, again I’m just guessing. I toss the “evidence” into a clear paper protector to keep the bottom section from smearing toner and put the bloody glass in a zip lock bag and start closing up the machine to see what works if anything. Amazingly the copier still “worked” the start button worked but the touch panel and other sections were fried. You could put something in the document feeder and it would make a single copy of what you put in, the doc feeder uses a small strip of glass of to the side and it was still intact. And everything internally was fine other than needing a new front door/cover. I write up what all the machine needs and head to the office with evidence in tow.

M: Our intrepid tech who has seen way to many stupid things to be surprised by any of this
S: Secretary
P: Principal

M: Ok, good news and bad news. The duplicator is not even worth looking at but the copier is salvageable with some parts and TLC.

S: Oh good we were hoping it wouldn’t be a complete loss. The principal wanted to talk to you once you were done, let me get him.

About 5 minutes pass and the secretary shows me to the principals office

P: So what’s the situation, I’m going to need estimates on repairs. We think we know who did it but are still looking into it.

I explained what all was wrong with the copier and duplicator.

P: Ok, just estimate a whole new control panel, insurance will be coving it if we don’t catch who did it, but if we do their parents will be.

M: Ok, that won’t be a problem, I have some “evidence” that may help you figure out who did it.

P: Evidence?

I showed him the bloody glass and then the butt print.

P: Oh my God… Well that should help, I think… Thanks for taking a look at things, can you email me the estimate here and he handed me a business card.

M: Sure thing

After I got back to the shop I emailed the estimate and we got the go ahead within a couple of days to fix the copier. I got to go back and fix everything up about a two weeks later, had some interesting news when I got done with repairs and went to get paperwork signed.

M: Morning P, everything is all fixed up. How’d you make out with your investigation.

P: Oh it was quite interesting. We had a couple students in with their parents asking them questions. The kids were denying everything till I brought up the bloody glass and the butt print. The one boy’s parents immediately started yelling at him. I guess he lied and made up some excuse why he needed to have some stiches in his butt. His dad went ballistic and said he’d be paying for everything if he didn’t fess up and say who was all involved. Turns out it was the two other boys there and one other who didn’t get caught. The others confirmed and the parents ended up having to split the bill. I could hear the parents yelling on the way out that the kids were making up for every penny they had to pay for their stupidity.

M: Well I’m glad you caught who did it. You have a good day and thanks for the laugh.

Wish I could have been a fly on the wall when that all went down.

TL: DR – Some idiots high schoolers broke in to their school and broke some equipment. One of them broke the copier and cut his butt making copies and then had to get stiches. They got caught after the principal brought up the butt print and broken glass. Parents make them pay for damages."
Commodore 1541 won't write to half of the disk,"I wanted to type this up before everyone who knows what I am talking about is dead.

I once worked for a computer repair store that specialized in Commodore repair.  The Commodore 1541 was the 5-1/4"" floppy disk drive that worked with the Commodore 64.

A  customer came in and said he could only fill a disk half way and then it would stop working.  I thought this was strange and had him set it up so he could show me.

So he shows me and it seems he is correct.  What could be causing this?  Then he tried to take the disk out and it wouldn't pop out (Clue number 1!).  But he says this is how it works and you have to grab it with your fingernails.

Now the 1541 had an ejector mechanism with a spring that pushed the  disk out when you opened the door.  This had never worked for the customer, so he didn't know it was broken.

So I open up the drive and discover that the ejector mechanism was tangled up.  Not only did it not eject the disk, but it also lifted the disk head up halfway through its full range of motion!

I untwisted the mechanism and the ejector worked and he could use the whole disk.  I was so surprised to see this problem that I didn't charge the customer.",2180,0,1,"Commodore 1541 won't write to half of the disk I wanted to type this up before everyone who knows what I am talking about is dead.

It can't be a firewall issue if there is no firewall!,"This has been an ongoing issue for me for the past week and still in the quagmire of this. So my client ""Jane"" has requested our assistance as her company switches over software vendors for some specific machines. Normally this isn't too bad basically you go to each of these machines point where it needs to get/send data to the new  IP address and make sure the routes in place. Since Jane's company already has a working relationship with the vendor ""Dumbass Inc"" (DAI) really it was a matter of making the change on each of the devices. 

The day of the switch over comes and they are doing these phased as to not take everything down at the same time. They start working machine 1 and it fails to check in. Jane (who loves us and hates DAI with the firey passion i have not seen out side of someone who works directly in IT) calls me and requests a conference call wit DAI to see whats going on. I call in and it goes something like this:

Jane: So we have Tyr4774 here from our IT team to assist  
DAI-1: Yeah so we are able to see the device come on line, we can ping it and trace route to it but the connection fails. Do you think your firewall could be blocking traffic?  
Me: I don't think so, we only have a L3 switch for routing internally and there are no ACLs on that SVI. All traffic should flow to your directly connected router. According to the routing table the next hand off if you device at X.X.X.X  
DAI-2:No that can't be the case, our networking team assures me that everything has been configured properly for our side.   
Me: Look, our device is on X.X.X.123, and your router is at X.X.X.10. The Gateway is at .254 and it says the next hop for Y.Y.Y.Y is X.X.X.10. I'll take a packet capture and see.

\*Take packet capture on link that connects directly to X.X.X.10\*

Me: As you can see here the packet to Y.Y.Y.Y on port 12345 as you defined, leaves our equipment, we see no return traffic and the issue must lie within your network.  
DAI-2: Here let me get my ""Senior Network Engineer"" on the line to take a look.

By this time i'm beating my head against the wall. I've done these before and it has always been a configuration error on DAI's end. 

DAI-3:Looking over the configuration there doesn't appear to be anything configured incorrectly on our end, are you sure there is no firewall blocking the traffic on your end?

By this time Jane can practically hear my teeth grinding into the microphone and is sure i'm about to just start drinking while on this call. At this point she takes my evidence (a nice pcap file) and lets DAI know that she will send this data to her account rep on how they're losing money and that they may go back to their old vendor if DAI can't get this fixed.",797,0,1,"It can't be a firewall issue if there is no firewall!

Check your calendar,"Hi, long time lurker, first time poster. 

English is not my first language sorry for any errors.

I'm working in a small company providing IT support to a whole lot of clients around our city. Very small to medium business, almost exclusively on mac.

The clients are, for the most part, nice. Except this client. It's a little client, not one with a maintenance contract. But he is so tech illiterate that it hurts. 

We had some trouble when he moved his business to another part of the city, and the isp couldn't find the fiber for his office. We finally managed to resolve the issue and he finally got internet after 2 month on 4g router. But since then he seems to be looking for any way to dump us. 

He calls every day for small idiotic problems, more idiotics than usual I mean. One day it's his VPN (didn't click ""connect""), the other it's a file on his server missing (moved it and doesn't know how to use search on Finder). And so on.

Come thursday when he calls about his calendar being missing and everything is our fault, nothing is working blablabla. I open TeamViewer (I saved is id), open calendar, check his name, behold his calendar is here, working as intended. 

Me :""everything is good ?""
Him :""grumbl"" *cut the call*

Keyboard not found - Press F1 to Resume,"Ok, this was back in the day.

We were writing custom software for businesses who thought that all that ""Windows"" stuff was a waste of money.

And they had a point. The current version of Windows was 2.0.3, and it was a pig. Personally, I preferred DesqView, when I was forced to work on PCs, though I had an Amiga at home.

Still, we were writing software for MsDOS 3.3 - without memory expansion, which meant we spent many hours pruning our overlay trees to get everything to fit in 640k.

There really weren't RDBMSes available for this environment. Instead of running a database server, our apps would manipulate the database files directly, using a linked C-ISAM library. No query language, simply code that would call index functions and read and write functions, etc. All the stuff that a SQL optimizer generates code to do we did ourselves, directly.

The ""network"", such as it was, was simply a file share, so all the apps running on different machines would manipulate the same database files.

But what about concurrency, you ask? Isn't it dangerous to have competing processes manipulating the same files? What about transactional integrity?

Well, you see, there wasn't any transactional integrity, because there weren't any transactions. If you wanted multiple database writes to be atomic, you needed to code it. Write the first record, write the second record, if the second write fails go back and delete the first, etc.

And there wasn't any locking, either, out of the box.

So what we had was a lock server. Every application, before it read or wrote a block to a database file, would make a network call to the lock server, reserving the block. And there had to be one instance of the lock server running on the local network, for any of this to work.

And, of course, since MsDOS was a single-tasking OS [sic], that meant a dedicated computer, on the network, running nothing but it. It didn't need a very powerful computer, or a very fast one. But it needed to be there. ([Sic] because in my mind, MsDOS wasn't an OS, it was program loader. Ditto for CP/M, MS Windows prior to Windows NT, Macintosh Finder prior to OSX, and pretty much everything else that pretended to be an OS on a desktop computer, except for OS/9 on the Radio Shack Color Computer. But, as I said, I had an Amiga, and was spoiled.)

So the customer pulled an old IBM PC (not a generic ""PC"", but an actual PC, back from the days when ""PC"" was the actual model name), configured autoexec.bat to run the lock server, stuck it in the corner and plugged it into the network.

Skip two years.

We get an emergency call. The customer had had a power outage, and when the power came back up nothing would work.

All of our apps reported ""unable to connect to lock server"", and exited. None of the employees knew what the lock server was, or where that old PC was.

It took us an hour on the phone to find someone who could locate that PC and report on its status.

""It's not working.""

Another hour on the phone to eventually confirm that yes, it was plugged in to power and to the network, and that when you turned it on the little lights did turn on. But ""it's not working.""

So, four hour drive out to the site.

Thats expensive and unnecessary,"A few years back I was working in automation. Office  buildings, factories, homes and many more we would make configurations for the automation for the climate control, lighting, alarm systems etc. We also wrote new programms on demand. One time a client which had costumers and employees working in their building asked us to do automation in their new building. They had windows 7 still going when windows 10 was brand new. We made the configuration and tested everything and it was all wonderful. 

Until this point the contact had been with the building developer, he asked us to get in touch with the client for the final details. We explained our product and what we had done and made some final configurations and then asked about the server. We usually do on premise dedicated automation servers but anything is possible for the right price. This client wanted to save some money on a million euro project and wanted a virtual server on a computer which was used for the electronic information boards. We told him it was a bad idea and explained why but the client had his mind made up.

Over the next years he sometimes would have small incidents like a sensor malfunction or a battery running low and hire us to do some work. Then he found a company cheaper than us. We didn't make much money of the client anyway so we happily turned over our configuration manual and some explanation to the cheaper company. We told them the information board computer also hosted the server and that it wouldn't work on windows 10 as you had to make an export, and reinstall with a software upgrade. 

After a year or so the client called us in rage. They had upgraded all the computers in the building to windows 10 using a student team. The information board computer had a sticker on it which said dont, but the students had checked if that software was compatible and upgraded the computer, not knowing the automation server was on there too.

The new cheaper company which took over from us had made changes in the configuration but never made a back up or did their administration. The lights wouldn't turn on, ventilation didn't work, the car park, the automated doors. Nothing worked anymore.

"I’m sorry you have to wait a bit, but holding me hostage won’t fix the problem any faster","&gt; Be me, over the phone/remote support

&gt; get call from elderly gentleman 

&gt; Run through basic troubleshooting

&gt; His idiot son literally requires me to explain every single step involved from tightening a coaxial cable to plugging in the power

Me:  ""Sure, what's going on?

A: ""The phone is acting weird.  I can hear it ring, but when I pick it up, I get nothing.  The call then goes to voice mail, but I can only hear it at the base station.  I also can't call out.""

First thing's first- replicate the problem.  So I call the bar phone from my cell.  The bar phone rings, but when I pick up there is silence, followed by three beeps and the phone going dead.  Okay, do it the other way, call my phone from the bar phone.  No dial tone, just silence and the three beeps.

Definitely a connection issue.

I waive down A and ask her to get me the other handsets (there are a total of three).  I do the same checks with each.  No joy, just silence and three beeps.  So we can rule out the handsets.

I pull up the @&amp;T website, and look up the FAQ troubleshooting guide.  90% of the answers aren't applicable, but I start with the first thing, ""unplug it all, wait a bit, then plug it all back in again.""  So I de-battery the phones, and get A to go unplug the base station for 60 seconds.  Replug it all, try the checks again.  No joy, just silence and beeps.

Hmmm.  Go back through the troubleshooting guide.  ""Check all connections.""

Check.  ALL.  Connections. 

I ask A if I can see the base station.  She leads me around the back of the building and in through the back door to the office.  The base station is on a shelf along with the wifi router, a rack with what looks like a small server, and a couple of computer towers.  I pull the base station, the connections in the back are all quite solid.  The power cable is plugged into a rather new power strip, which is solidly plugged into the wall.  Then I follow the phone cable.

Oh.  My.  That cable has been here a while.  Not only is it cable stapled to the wall, it's obviously been so since the last remodel, which happened long before I became a regular six years ago.  The cable has been painted over with the same paint as the wall, right up to the wall jack.  And while the phone cable is *technically* in the jack, it's obviously not seated well.

So I pull it out.  Give it a twist to see if imparting torsion on the cable will keep it properly seated.  It goes in, but barely clicks.  Do the checks, and damn, it works!

A:  ""You are a genius, Osiris.  I can't believe you got it to work again.""

Me:  ""No, not a genius, just experienced.  But you need to do two things.  You need to replace this phone cable.  That's easy, just send someone up to Ace Hardware and have them buy a short phone cable.  Then, you need to talk to your handyman and have him replace that wall jack.

"You said the machine could do this, I know you did!","TL: DR at bottom

Most techs can confirm and will agree that the less users who use/have access to equipment the better. Have a printer/copier that runs 100k prints a month with one or two users and you might get a service call once every three months for routine maintenance, same piece of equipment running 20k prints a month with 30+ users and you’re lucky to go two weeks without someone having an “ïssue”. The same rule holds true for workstations/servers. With that said I think schools are by far one of the worst places to have to deal with service issues because teachers never print things early or plan ahead and usually have to have things “NOW! I’m late for class!” Those that do plan ahead are unicorns and God sent users to make our lives a little easier. I was normally the setup tech on jobs and instructed users in small groups on how to use/operate the machine, after dealing with an abundant amount of “sales trained” user issues I finally got them to let me tag along and do the training. Now on to the story:

This is another story from early 2000’s. We had several service contracts for multiple school districts across several counties and when they called in they got top priority. This particular school district was always a pain, the high school was good because they had multiple machines on a single floor layout and one main unit in the office that was setup as the go to machine for almost all teachers print outs. The secretaries in the office were the select few who could change supplies and remove paper jams with no troubles, if they couldn’t get it they left it alone and called for service *AHHHH, angelic voices praising their rarity*. The middle school was next as they had a similar setup but also had a secondary main unit on the second floor due to the layout and amount of teachers, again a select few users knew what they were doing and rarely got calls for this school as well. Now the elementary school…. I don’t know if it was due to dealing with younger kids or that the teachers were just a different breed but the elementary school was always the problem child of the three. The layout was all over the place and they had no main machines for most users, they even had a copier by the lunch/break room along the wall out in the hall with the students. This machine was not the one with issues this particular day, no this one was in the teachers stock room with no AC and an army of spiders waiting to descend upon anything alive left alone in the dark. We got a call mid-morning that this machine was jammed, nothing was going through and it had a horrible “melted plastic smell”

*How many techs now exactly where this is headed?*

I get on site and of course the machine is still powered on, half the covers left open, jam indicators all over the place, and the lingering smell of melted plastic wafting in the air due to zero air flow in the room. I clear out all the jams and close everything up to see what happens, machine warms up and starts to resume the print job, sure enough paper jam at paper exit and back through the machine. I again go through the machine but there’s no paper at the exit section, I do however have a nice accordion sticking out of the fuser entry.

*Please don’t let this be what I think it is*

I power the machine off and proceed to take things apart to get the fuser out, as soon as I had it in my hands I knew what I feared was in fact the issue. An over-head projector transparency…

Now for those who aren’t cringing at this let me explain, there are two main types of transparencies. Those that are rated for laser printers/copiers and those that are rated for inkjet printers. You do NOT use inkjet transparencies in a laser machine, you’re going to have a bad day! Well, your repair tech will have a bad day, users could care less.  Laser printers/copiers have fusers that heat up to a couple hundred degrees, inkjets have ZERO heat. So the transparencies meant for laser machines are made to NOT turn into a giant melted pile of your day just got a whole lot worse, inkjet transparencies on the other hand if used in a laser machine will turn into an instant glob of melted plastic that hardens into a brick.

I say this because it’s not just one transparency melted into the fuser, oh no that’d be too easy, no whoever was trying to print these transparencies felt the need to keep trying after the first one failed. The entire exit section of the fuser was one giant glob of plastic, sadly it had not hit the exit actuator in the fuser which would’ve completely stopped the copier from working do to it never resetting the jam. I’m guessing there was a good five or six transparencies melted into the fuser. One of the rules our manager had was if you can get a machine working get it working, even if it looks bad on prints get it working at least. So I proceed to clear a spot on one of the tables in the room, grab a chair, my cutters, forceps, tweezers, pliers, and I start prying/cutting/pulling/picking apart this mass of hardened plastic. Roughly an hour and a half later I have removed said plastic, I then spent about 30 minutes straightening guides and brackets so the separation fingers and actuators worked properly. Luckily the heat roller is Teflon coated so I just had to wipe it clean. I finally put the copier back together and after warm up it fires out the print job that was still waiting to come through, SUCCESS!!!

Now the reason I mentioned above that I was the one who trained the users is because when I train them I specifically ask if they are ever going to do transparencies, if they say yes I make it a MAJOR point to explain the difference between transparency types and that inkjet transparencies are not to come anywhere NEAR the copiers because they will do exactly what happened here. I know I trained this school so I take the print job to the office to find out what teacher it belonged to and asked if they could meet me at the copier. The secretary buzzes the teacher and I head back to the copier.

I need to note I’ve dealt with a lot of customers who get defensive the second you question anything they’ve done to equipment (As I’m sure EVERY tech reading this has) so I know to keep a calm, cool, customer service voice and to always be polite while trying to explain things, you have to baby step people to understand that they screwed up but it’s not a big deal if they learn from it.

M: Me 

T: Teacher


T: The office said you wanted to talk to me?

M: Yes, do you remember when I trained you how to use the copier I showed you how to do transparencies?

T: Of course I do, you always put them in the side tray.

M: Correct, do you remember the other thing I made a big deal about when doing transparencies?

T: *looks offended I asked this question* No, you only said to use the side tray, these copiers can run transparencies. You told us it could!

M: It can, may I please see the box of transparencies you used?

T: *half in a huff* walks past me to another section of shelves and grabs the transparencies. Here I used these I brought from home, I like theses better than the ones we have here.

M: And where are the ones that the school provides?

*getting angrier* walks to shelves again and shoves the box in my hand.

T: Here!

M: I place the boxes side by side and show her where it clearly says on the boxes in big bold letters INKJET and LASER/COPIER. Do you see the product description here?

T: Of course, what’s the big deal they’re both transparencies.

M: Well the big deal is that the ones that say laser/copiers are meant to be used in the copier, the ones that say inkjet are not.

T: They’re both transparencies, you said we could use transparencies in this machine, I know you said we could!

M: I did but I made sure to mention to use laser/copier rated ones only.

T: There can’t be much difference between them, what’s the big deal!

M: Well the big deal the ones I said will work will work fine and the others do this. I then show her the massive pile of melted plastic bits I had sitting on the table covered up with a rag.

T: *Oh shit face* There’s no way that was in the copier! I pulled all the jams out earlier and finally gave up after a while.

I proceeded to explain what I typed above and showed her exactly where it all got caught in the copier. I said if she wants to use her own transparencies it has to say laser/copier on the box or else it will happen again and there will be a bill for repairs.

T: *sheepishly* Ok, I think I’ll just use the ones the school has.

M: That would probably be best, I just don’t want you to get in trouble. You’re not the first person to do this and won’t be the last, but so far you are defiantly the most persistent to try and get it to work. You have a good day ok.

T: thank you… you too

I packed up, wrote up my paperwork, and headed back to the shop. I made notes to replace the couple of guides I “repaired” next time a tech was in the area. I honestly didn’t want her getting in trouble for this. She wasn’t the first user who had done this but most give up after the first or second attempt.
 
TL: DR – teacher uses wrong type of transparencies in copier and makes a very big mess of melted plastic I had to remove.

This is another story from early 2000’s. We had several service contracts for multiple school districts across several counties and when they called in they got top priority. This particular school district was always a pain, the high school was good because they had multiple machines on a single floor layout and one main unit in the office that was setup as the go to machine for almost all teachers print outs. The secretaries in the office were the select few who could change supplies and remove paper jams with no troubles, if they couldn’t get it they left it alone and called for service *AHHHH, angelic voices praising their rarity*. The middle school was next as they had a similar setup but also had a secondary main unit on the second floor due to the layout and amount of teachers, again a select few users knew what they were doing and rarely got calls for this school as well. Now the elementary school…. I don’t know if it was due to dealing with younger kids or that the teachers were just a different breed but the elementary school was always the problem child of the three. The layout was all over the place and they had no main machines for most users, they even had a copier by the lunch/break room along the wall out in the hall with the students. This machine was not the one with issues this particular day, no this one was in the teachers stock room with no AC and an army of spiders waiting to descend upon anything alive left alone in the dark. We got a call mid-morning that this machine was jammed, nothing was going through and it had a horrible “melted plastic smell”

*How many techs now exactly where this is headed?*

I get on site and of course the machine is still powered on, half the covers left open, jam indicators all over the place, and the lingering smell of melted plastic wafting in the air due to zero air flow in the room. I clear out all the jams and close everything up to see what happens, machine warms up and starts to resume the print job, sure enough paper jam at paper exit and back through the machine. I again go through the machine but there’s no paper at the exit section, I do however have a nice accordion sticking out of the fuser entry.

*Please don’t let this be what I think it is*

I power the machine off and proceed to take things apart to get the fuser out, as soon as I had it in my hands I knew what I feared was in fact the issue. An over-head projector transparency…

Now for those who aren’t cringing at this let me explain, there are two main types of transparencies. Those that are rated for laser printers/copiers and those that are rated for inkjet printers. You do NOT use inkjet transparencies in a laser machine, you’re going to have a bad day! Well, your repair tech will have a bad day, users could care less.  Laser printers/copiers have fusers that heat up to a couple hundred degrees, inkjets have ZERO heat. So the transparencies meant for laser machines are made to NOT turn into a giant melted pile of your day just got a whole lot worse, inkjet transparencies on the other hand if used in a laser machine will turn into an instant glob of melted plastic that hardens into a brick.

I say this because it’s not just one transparency melted into the fuser, oh no that’d be too easy, no whoever was trying to print these transparencies felt the need to keep trying after the first one failed. The entire exit section of the fuser was one giant glob of plastic, sadly it had not hit the exit actuator in the fuser which would’ve completely stopped the copier from working do to it never resetting the jam. I’m guessing there was a good five or six transparencies melted into the fuser. One of the rules our manager had was if you can get a machine working get it working, even if it looks bad on prints get it working at least. So I proceed to clear a spot on one of the tables in the room, grab a chair, my cutters, forceps, tweezers, pliers, and I start prying/cutting/pulling/picking apart this mass of hardened plastic. Roughly an hour and a half later I have removed said plastic, I then spent about 30 minutes straightening guides and brackets so the separation fingers and actuators worked properly. Luckily the heat roller is Teflon coated so I just had to wipe it clean. I finally put the copier back together and after warm up it fires out the print job that was still waiting to come through, SUCCESS!!!

Now the reason I mentioned above that I was the one who trained the users is because when I train them I specifically ask if they are ever going to do transparencies, if they say yes I make it a MAJOR point to explain the difference between transparency types and that inkjet transparencies are not to come anywhere NEAR the copiers because they will do exactly what happened here. I know I trained this school so I take the print job to the office to find out what teacher it belonged to and asked if they could meet me at the copier. The secretary buzzes the teacher and I head back to the copier.

I need to note I’ve dealt with a lot of customers who get defensive the second you question anything they’ve done to equipment (As I’m sure EVERY tech reading this has) so I know to keep a calm, cool, customer service voice and to always be polite while trying to explain things, you have to baby step people to understand that they screwed up but it’s not a big deal if they learn from it.

M: Me 

T: Teacher


T: The office said you wanted to talk to me?

M: Yes, do you remember when I trained you how to use the copier I showed you how to do transparencies?

T: Of course I do, you always put them in the side tray.

M: Correct, do you remember the other thing I made a big deal about when doing transparencies?

T: *looks offended I asked this question* No, you only said to use the side tray, these copiers can run transparencies. You told us it could!

M: It can, may I please see the box of transparencies you used?

T: *half in a huff* walks past me to another section of shelves and grabs the transparencies. Here I used these I brought from home, I like theses better than the ones we have here.

M: And where are the ones that the school provides?

*getting angrier* walks to shelves again and shoves the box in my hand.

T: Here!

M: I place the boxes side by side and show her where it clearly says on the boxes in big bold letters INKJET and LASER/COPIER. Do you see the product description here?

T: Of course, what’s the big deal they’re both transparencies.

M: Well the big deal is that the ones that say laser/copiers are meant to be used in the copier, the ones that say inkjet are not.

T: They’re both transparencies, you said we could use transparencies in this machine, I know you said we could!

M: I did but I made sure to mention to use laser/copier rated ones only.

T: There can’t be much difference between them, what’s the big deal!

M: Well the big deal the ones I said will work will work fine and the others do this. I then show her the massive pile of melted plastic bits I had sitting on the table covered up with a rag.

T: *Oh shit face* There’s no way that was in the copier! I pulled all the jams out earlier and finally gave up after a while.

I proceeded to explain what I typed above and showed her exactly where it all got caught in the copier. I said if she wants to use her own transparencies it has to say laser/copier on the box or else it will happen again and there will be a bill for repairs.

T: *sheepishly* Ok, I think I’ll just use the ones the school has.

M: That would probably be best, I just don’t want you to get in trouble. You’re not the first person to do this and won’t be the last, but so far you are defiantly the most persistent to try and get it to work. You have a good day ok.

T: thank you… you too

I packed up, wrote up my paperwork, and headed back to the shop. I made notes to replace the couple of guides I “repaired” next time a tech was in the area. I honestly didn’t want her getting in trouble for this. She wasn’t the first user who had done this but most give up after the first or second attempt.
 
TL: DR – teacher uses wrong type of transparencies in copier and makes a very big mess of melted plastic I had to remove.

"""Why did my report change"", angry sales manager said","I sometimes work with customizing BI reports/visualizations for our clients. Today I got an email request to do a minor change from the sales manager at one of our clients. From previous interactions I already knew this guy tends to be very unspecific and blunt in his requests.

Now BI can be a very complicated field and it's not uncommon to go through misunderstandings and lots of back and forth with the client to get the correct end result, but in this case it's a very simple report and scenario, so it should be easy enough to follow:

Just imagine a order report that is simply a table of three columns: Customer name, the date of the order and the amount of the order. This report is sorted by the order amount, and is cut off at 10 orders. So the point of the report is to show the largest 10 orders this month, which is why it's titled ""Top 10 orders"".

**Client:** ""Hi, I would like to have the ""Top 10 orders"" report changed to be sorted by date instead of amount.""

*(To sort the entire table by date all I basically have to do is click the date column, which was my first instinct, but I quickly realised that was probably not actually what he wanted, or so I thought)..*

**Me:** ""Okay, no problem. Now the current use of the report is to show the 10 largest orders this month, so if I change the sorting to date it wouldn't actually show the largest orders anymore since there are obviously way more than 10 orders in the system.... Or when I think about it, I guess what you are asking is that it should still display the top 10 orders, but out of those ten it is sorted by date? Is that correct? That's gonna take a little more work but I can get it done within the hour.""

**Client:** ""No, you misunderstand. Doesn't matter if it's the top 10 orders or not. I just want it to sort by date, so that the last order is at the top""

**Me:** ""Okay, so you just want to the report sorted by date even if it's not the 10 largest orders this month? No problem, but I guess that changes the purpose of the report so maybe it should be titled ""Latest 10 orders"" instead? Are you sure you don't want this a separate report so you can still have the ""Top 10 orders"" in place?""

**Client:** ""Why are you making this so complicated? Just give me the report sorted by date, it shouldn't be that hard!""

**Me:** ""...............Alright. So I'll sort it by date and I won't rename it, and I'll call you when it's done in a few minutes, and then you can let me know if the end result is how you wanted it. Okay?""

**Client:** ""Fine.""

*Now I very well knew that this was not going to turn out the as he wanted (whatever it is that he wanted), but I was so dumbfounded at the lack of understanding so I thought it's better if he just saw for himself. I clicked date column to sort by it and saved the report, and of course the orders in the table are now simply the latest 10 orders in the system, not the largest ones.

I call the customer:

**Me:** ""Okay it's done, take a look if you can"".

**Client:** ""But this is not the same report as earlier? Why did it change?""

**Me:** ""Well, we changed the sorting? Other than that it's exactly the same.""

**Client:** ""How can you say it's exactly the same? None of the customers I had in the report previously are there now? I specifically remember having Customer X, Customer Y and Customer Z in the report but they're not there anymore.""

**Me**: ""Well I would assume that's because those customers aren't among the last 10 customers to have purchased something.""

**Client:** ""Why does that make a difference? I just told you to make the same report sorted by date!""

**Me:** ""This was my initial concern. That's why I asked if you want the largest top 10 orders in the table, and then those 10 orders were sorted by date? We can do that if you want, no problem"".

**Client:** ""And I already told you it doesn't matter if it's the top 10 orders! The last order to come through should be at the top!""

**Me:** ""And if you look at it now, is the top order not the last order?""

*At this point I can practically hear the logical meltdown through the phone.*

We still went through a couple of back and forths and I'm still not sure what he actually wanted, but I honestly don't really think he knew himself.

""Well, that's not the problem,"" says I to myself. We don't have a password scraper, and even if we did re-entering one scheduled task's user/pass combination wouldn't cause all of them to change.

The game is afoot!

Check out the history of one task, then another, then a third. Yup, all consistent failed at nearly the same time, with the logs saying:

IdiotVendor re-iterates there's no way it's a user rights issue and it's got to be passwords because it wouldn't work then fail if it was user rights.

We agree to create a new account and password for exclusive use for the scheduled tasks, since using Domain Admin is completely stupid. This is accomplished in short order, I change these on all scheduled tasks, and we're off to the races. IdiotVendor will monitor in the overnight.

Log on, look around, scheduled task log files are gone. Well, so much for troubleshooting the logs.

Can we skip those steps?,"Here is a tale of how a user requested that we skip troubleshooting steps and assume that some things worked without testing them...

We were over the phone troubleshooting network connectivity of an ethernet port as it did not seem to be working. 

We went through all of the basic steps, reconnecting cable from device to wall, trying another cable, things like that. Most of the time this is caused by the drop not being patched in the server room to the switch, Then you just need to hope that you have labeling and can get that patched!

I talked the user (A technical one) through finding the port on the switch, and on the patch panel and connecting them. We then go to test the port again and still no connectivity. At this point I requested that we try to use another computer to test the connection, or another known working usb to ethernet adapter to confirm that the device we are using to troubleshoot is not the issue, as we fixed what was likely the actual issue. 

Their reply was asking if we could ""skip those steps"" because ""This laptop is almost brand new and I know it works well""... 

For those of us who have spent many an hour working with vendors, you know all too well, no matter how new it is, that does not mean it is immune to problems!

I am stunned by this and am not about to waste my time running in circles when we did not try to verify what we are using to test. I ask them to send pictures of the network closet to buy me time to think on how to handle this. 

A few hours later they emailed back saying that they figured it out, the port was active, it was the adapter that was the issue preventing it from working once it had been patched!

This is why you do not skip troubleshooting steps!",1452,0,1,"Can we skip those steps? Here is a tale of how a user requested that we skip troubleshooting steps and assume that some things worked without testing them...

We were over the phone troubleshooting network connectivity of an ethernet port as it did not seem to be working. 

We went through all of the basic steps, reconnecting cable from device to wall, trying another cable, things like that. Most of the time this is caused by the drop not being patched in the server room to the switch, Then you just need to hope that you have labeling and can get that patched!

I talked the user (A technical one) through finding the port on the switch, and on the patch panel and connecting them. We then go to test the port again and still no connectivity. At this point I requested that we try to use another computer to test the connection, or another known working usb to ethernet adapter to confirm that the device we are using to troubleshoot is not the issue, as we fixed what was likely the actual issue. 

Their reply was asking if we could ""skip those steps"" because ""This laptop is almost brand new and I know it works well""...

Fear of computers is apparently less then the desire to just stay home,"Like many people, my job is happening almost entirely remotely right now. Luckily, we've been set up for years to remote into our employees' PCs. We extended this privilege to most of our employees as well, so they can work from home.

Attached is a picture saying ""system compatibility report - NVidia (graphic card number)"" and then a big blue ""FIX"" button. 

This specific user mainly does statistics and inventory management. He's prepared a few reports that use graphics, but it's normally in collaboration with other teams, and I hadn't heard of such a project since the lockdown happened. However, I don't hear everything, and we all know how communication can be lost right now. 

I shoot an email back.

&gt;(Employee)It sends you to this page (nvidia driver page - legit page), and at that point I am pretty lost and don't want to start downloading and installing stuff when I don't really know what I am doing.

An hour passes...

&gt;(Employee) I can't find the V.

&gt;(Me) I'll go into the office tomorrow and fix it. 

It's actually nice to drive in and have the building to myself. I put on a podcast or stream something and don't have to worry about anyone else being bothered.

Of course he wouldn't bother to mention he was doing something completely, utterly, mindbogglingly different from everyone else in the company. 

We have loaner laptops, but they're primarily for people who travel to conferences, or need to do presentations outside of our offices. None of them are set up for video editing. 

The remote software is also different, and not something I want to walk this guy through.

After I calm down a little, I send this back.

My router doesn’t have an SSID!,"For context, I work for a cable company. I did field install and repair for years but have since been promoted to plant maintenance. 

I had just parked my truck on the side of the road and was getting ready to boom up for some work when a customer approached me. 

Me: Hi there! How can I help you sir?

Customer: Hi! I just had my equipment installed yesterday but my router doesn’t have an SSID so I can’t connect to WiFi. 

Me: That’s odd. All of our routers have an SSID built in by default. Did you check the sticker on the back? Or do you mean it isn’t broadcasting?

Customer: Yeah, it’s the weirdest thing, I can’t find any networks nearby. There are serial numbers and a Mac address on the sticker but no SSID!

Me: well, that sounds like what you’ve got is actually just a modem.

I start to explain to him that it takes two devices to make wi-fi internet work, a modem and a router but he cuts me off mid sentence. 

Customer: No no, it’s a combo unit.

Me: Combo units have the SSID on a sticker on the back. 

Customer: well, this one doesn’t.

Me: well, then isn’t a combo unit. It sounds like what you have is just a modem. 

Customer: No, it’s a combo unit. 

(Sigh)

Me: Well, I have some work to do here so I will be around for a little bit. If you want to bring it out I will have a look and confirm for you what kind of device it is, but it does not sound like you have a router. 

The customer looked visibly frustrated with me at this point, probably because he felt like I wasn’t listening to his problem. But the problem was pretty darn obvious to me. I started putting on my harness and putting down my wheel chocks. The customer scurried off down the road, mumbling and kicking at the gravel. 

About 15 minutes later he pulls up in a truck, gets out, walks right into my coned off safety area and stands right beneath my bucket while I’m in the air. I tell him he needs to move outside of my cones, and ask if he needs me to move my truck so he can get by.

Customer: No, I just brought my truck so when we’re done talking I can go and replace this defective router unit.

lUser: .... ok..... But how can I be sure that when I connect to the \[panel SSID\] that I won't be disconnected from the office network?

Me: *palm already hurts, starting to create a crater in my desk* Ma'am, talk to your office manager, maybe even your IT, check your closets and drawers -- just FIND THE ROUTER. It will make your life a lot simpler."
My phone keeps playing music at random times!,"So first: it won't be very long. I am not good at that.

But let's start.

Normal summer day in a Polish seaside city. I was waiting for my (Not so) Fast City Rail service (actually slower than normal trains) as I was going for my sailing lessons. I buy a ticket in a ticket machine, and this mid-30s guy (G) approaches me (I am 15).

G - Good morning, sorry to interrupt you but my phone keeps playing music at random times.

Me - Really?

Phone - *starts playing music*

G - See? I didn't do anything.

Me - Have you tried to restart the device? It works often when something wrong happens.

G - Yeah, I tried but it didn't work.

Me - Can I see your phone then?

G - Sure.

It was a Huawei. Looking near to mine, just older model. First thing I saw was a weird app for functions you already get in there - alarm.

Me - Do you know sir that you have this function in your phone already? Also, this app looks a bit sketchy to me.

G - if it will fix the problem, delete it.

So I delete the app, just when my train approaches the station.

Me - Sorry, I have to go now, my train is there.

G - I am also going on that train.

Me - Ok, I can continue trying to solve the problem there.

We boarded the train, sat down. Guess what the phone did? *Plays that song again*

Me - I think the app was not the problem then. I need to see what causes that.

G - OK.

Then I saw IT. Just when the notification on top of the screen shows up, the music restarts. *BINGO.*

Me - I think I know the problem. Can I go into device settings? (I asked it due to the fact I wouldn't want anyone to mess in my settings). I think I know the problem.

I go directly to notifications, and what tone is selected for those. It was a whole, 3 minute song. I select a random, MUCH shorter notification.

Me - I found it. The song (pointing at the name of the song on the screen) was selected as a notification. I selected a shorter one, but feel free to change it to other one, as long as it is around as short as this one, or you'll still have the same problem.

G - Can you tell me where to get to those settings then?

Me - Sure. (Shows him how to do it).

G - Thanks!

Then we talked a bit - about him getting a new flat, about his new bluetooth headphones that were apparently not working (due to being a very cheap ones, around 10$ in Poland) and I told him that for this money he can get good wire headphones. He tried mine, but headphones are not the point of this post.

100% CPU Usage,"Alright so this just happened...

TLDR A customer ordered a shitty computer and after her declining my and my managers offer to change to a better one, she comes back in demanding to fix her “slow” computer

So this customer orders a $hitty Ollee laptop (Celeron CPU, 4GB RAM, 64GB HDD) from us, I call her and politely advice her how shit of a choice that she’s making and she goes “no it’s ok i did my research I want that one”.

She has then asked me to install Office on her computer. So i’m doing it and it literally took like 3 seconds to even open the start menu, so I was like well let’s just have a look at the CPU Performance, then I come across this... 100% OF THE CPU.... FOR INSTALLING OFFICE IM SORRY WHAT. So I give it to her.

and today she comes wandering back in and the conversation goes roughly as follows:

Customer: “I bought this computer from you guys the other day”

Me: “Yes I remember, how’s it all going”

Customer: *snaps\* “What do you think, it’s an absolute sh** house”

Me: “Unfortunately yeah it wasn’t the best of the computers”

Customer: “Well that’s ridiculous there has to be a way you can fix it, take it right now and fix it”

At this point I go talk to the manager and he says the exact same thing I said, she bought a horrible computer, you offered a different computer, she was fully aware of what it would be like. He said for me to save the stress and swap it over and she can pay the difference

Me: “So my manager has just reinstated what I said, the quality of the computer is not built for much but my manager wants to-“

Customer: “Thats just f**king ridiculous I bought a $400 computer from you guys I expect at the least better service”

Me: “Look we’re not supposed to but my manager has authorised me to be able to swap it over to another computer and you can pay the difference”

Customer: “I’m not paying another cent!!! Just fix my computer and make it faster”

Me: “There’s literally nothing I can do with that, I did advise you on the day that this computer was not made to do much” (I know there are ways to optimise speeds within reason but the company I work for don’t allow us to do it)

After that it goes back and forth but I end up closing the door on her while she kicks up a fuss and yeah, long story short don’t buy shitty computers 😂

The Quiet Fixer,"OK this one is short-ish but I had to mention it...

Go back a couple jobs when I was just a tier 1 support person, we had this mean lady in accounting (yes all the stereotypes apply here) who instead of calling us/submitting a ticket for help would just try to fix things herself. I applaud self sufficiency in trying to fix your own problems but at a certain point just stop and let the experts do it. This started with software issues and what not but then....

One day I walk into the copier room (had about 3 different devices in there) and I find one with the panels open, screws laying on the counter and no one around. I have no clue who or what. I called the printer company we had a service contract with and they put it back together and found a paper jam. No biggy right?

Fast forward a month now. The printer in accounting is broken, someone else called it in. I go over there and same thing, panels open, screws laying there, and this time a screwdriver. I recognized the screwdriver as I've seen it laying on the accounting lady's desk before so I went up to her with it and she admitted she tried to ""fix"" it because it was jammed and gave up. Didn't tell us or her coworkers or anyone.

Printer company comes out again, this time she messed it up good. I mean broken components and she shoved the screwdriver through the fuser on the printer needing extensive work (and not cheap). Printer company told me. I told bosses. Bosses got together and told her that any more of her attempted ""repairs"" she was going to pay for out of her own paycheck. And since that was her job she would have to fill out the paperwork for the withholding herself. Lol.

The firing of a frequent flyer,"When I worked at an MSP, one of our major clients was a huge law firm with about 100+ employees.

Out of that client, however, one user - Phil -  called almost daily about things that were easily fixable, but insisted it be resolved by an on-site tech. The client had a weekly visit by the on-site tech to follow up on minor issues, but anything beyond that required an emergency dispatch (and a high billing rate). Phil didn't care, he didn't want to perform any remote troubleshooting and the issue always had to be fixed ASAP - even though it could be resolved with an agent over the phone.

One day the account manager for that client pulled a log of all the tickets they had opened with support for the last six months. The client management was demanding to know why their support bill was so high and why they were losing productivity because of down computer equipment. The account manager showed that Phil was the driving force behind the majority of their support calls, always demanding the issue be fixed by the on-site tech and never working with the remote support. Apparently, whenever Phil had a ""computer problem"" he would refuse to do any work because his system was ""broken"" until a tech came to fix it - he wouldn't even switch to another available workstation because of ""ergonomic concerns"".

However, after poring over the call logs provided by our account manager, the client found out that Phil had a habit of calling whenever a report was due, which was then delayed because of a random ""computer problem"". Also, Phil was still logging the hours he spent waiting for his computer to be fixed as time worked on a case (a big no-no in the legal profession because it could be considered fraudulent billing).

The last straw for Phil's boss was a call I took. Phil's mouse was no longer working. Yes, it was securely connected to the workstation. No, it didn't work on other workstations. Yes, another mouse worked on his system. No, using the other mouse wasn't an acceptable solution because he had a special ""ergo"" mouse. Fortunately, there was already going to be a tech on-site for the weekly visit that day. I told the tech about Phil's mouse issue, and he packed a spare ergo mouse that was the same model for a swap.

When the tech got out there, he discovered:
1. Phil didn't use a special ergonomic mouse, it was the standard one that came with his computer.
2. The mouse was *not* securely connected.
3. After plugging the mouse in tight, it worked.

Phil was let go immediately after that and suddenly the client's call volume dropped.",2271,0,1,"The firing of a frequent flyer When I worked at an MSP, one of our major clients was a huge law firm with about 100+ employees.

Website IP-blocking woes,"Hello! Long time lurker, first time poster. This tale just happened a few minutes ago, and I need to vent this out.

&amp;nbsp;

To pave over a lot of minor details, our LAN &amp; WiFi are completely separated from each other, with each having its own public IP address. 

&amp;nbsp;

Recently, our hosting provider was blocking IP addresses from our range. Needless to say, a few weeks ago, we had to resolve our LAN being blocked from accessing our own website. We had to get our manager to talk to the provider to get it unblocked (They only unblock with managerial/executive approval, and we can't remove the block ourselves). The problem was fixed, and we moved on.

&amp;nbsp;

We now approach our current problem: Our WiFi is now the network that is being blocked by our hosting provider. The answer should be as simple as the last one: Get our manager to talk to the provider again to unblock the WiFi's IP address. This is where the problem starts:

&amp;nbsp;

Manager: (After checking it himself using his WiFi-connected phone) Why can't I see to our website?!?

Support Guy 1: Like we said earlier, our hosting provider blocked us via our WiFi's IP address. They'll only unblock if you tell them to.

Manager: Then why can I still access (national bank)'s website? And why can I still access our website on my desktop? (Desktop's connected to LAN)

Me: Because only our provider's hosted websites are blocked to only our WiFi. (national bank) likely doesn't use our provider. Also, our LAN &amp; our WiFi are 2 separate networks.

Manager: So it is our WiFi's problem.

Support Guy 1: No, it's our hosting provider. They're blocking us via our WiFi's IP address.

Manager: Then why can I access (rival)'s website?

Me: Because (rival) probably doesn't use our provider. Only our provider's hosted websites are blocked to us.

(Repeat a few more times: Manager asking why he can still access **insert website that probably doesn't use our provider**, or why he can still access it via his desktop. We respond with the same answer(s): ""provider is blocking us via our WiFi's IP address"", ""**Other website** probably doesn't use our provider"", or ""LAN's address wasn't blocked, so it wasn't affected"".) 

Support Guy 1: We keep telling you, it's our provider. You need to call them to unblock us via our WiFi's IP address.

It's monday and I'm back to work. First thing I notice during the morning routine is that the guy I reported, who talked about messing with the printer settings to his buddy in the break room, wasn't there.

Since I was the one solving everything I thought hey maybe I can get some more info on this, because no one really knew what happened and my coworkers couldn't tell me anything either. So I took my laptop and to my surprise, my boss Cc'd me in the email excange. 

What I now know: Ok so the guy wasn't fired. I would have been surprised otherwise. It's not that easy to fire someone in germany and in this case the main point of the excuse was that he didn't know that changing a mere two settings could have such a bug impact so he was given a warning, but not fired. Secondly they transferred him to the packaging department (a department that, for what it is, is surprisingly void of printers ...). And lastly from what I know they cut his pay somewhat. They can't really do much there because the amount is set, but they're allowed to cut some for the damages he caused for quite a while.

Are those the right solutions? I don't know. I don't really care either because for me it was just me doing my job. But does he deserve it for messing with production? I think so, yeah.",1678,0,1,"Followup: the guy who changed printer settings to avoid work

"""I read the email, but...!"" Part 2","Hi friends, I'm back with another tale! You may remember my previous post you can [read about here](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/i3pl1r/i_read_the_email_but/). TL;DR - Major unplanned system outage, only email was working since its Exchange, and everyone and their mother's dog called asking why they couldn't get in to XYZ program specifically mentioned in the email.

Well, now its time for the follow up emails, and the disaster that has been today.

Since the fallout of said outage, we've been rolling out Multi-factor authentication to all end users. This is a large company, so we've been doing it in bits and pieces over the past few weeks, and it's been working pretty well. Until today, that is.

You see, last week we sent out a mass email, saying that MFA **NEEDS** to be set up by end of day on Friday for **EVERYONE**. Otherwise, you won't be able to sign in to, well, anything that uses network credentials come Monday morning. Gave the dates in big, bold letters in the subject, gave step by step instructions on how to set it up, and even included a nice video of a person setting it up. Gotta go above and beyond, then end users will understand how important this is and what to do, right?

If you guessed right, you're obviously a comedian, or put waaaay to much faith in the average person. Dozens upon dozens of calls and emails flooding the help desk, each one a different version of the same story:

""I can't sign in to $PROGRAM, it keeps asking for a code, what is that, it's never been there before?!""

I casually mention the email sent out last week (omitting the part about it being sent out EVERY DAY last week), and the responses are varied, but similiar:

""I didn't know that email applied me.""

""I thought that was only for people working remotely.""

""The instructions aren't very clear""

Or, my favorite: ""I already did it, and its still not working!"" (No, no you didn't Karen, I can literally see you haven't even tried to set it up yet)

At least its pretty easy to set up....so long as you can understand such difficult concepts as ""Click on the MFA link in your email,"" and ""Enter the code it sends to your phone.""

And of course, once I get it set up, without fail, I get such a lovely follow up question: 

""Am I going to have to do this *every day?*"" They say, some with genuine curiosity, most with disgusted discontent.

Yes, yes you do. It takes about an extra 8 seconds of your time to generate and enter the code. Trust me, I've been doing it for a month now.

Or, my favorite: ""I already did it, and its still not working!"" (No, no you didn't Karen, I can literally see you haven't even tried to set it up yet)

At least its pretty easy to set up....so long as you can understand such difficult concepts as ""Click on the MFA link in your email,"" and ""Enter the code it sends to your phone.""

And of course, once I get it set up, without fail, I get such a lovely follow up question: 

""Am I going to have to do this *every day?*"" They say, some with genuine curiosity, most with disgusted discontent.

Yes, yes you do. It takes about an extra 8 seconds of your time to generate and enter the code. Trust me, I've been doing it for a month now. If that 8 seconds is really messing up your schedule, you might want to rethink your morning Starbucks run."

"If everything is exclaimed, nothing is","What is it with some users and exclamation marks? Do they really think everything they write is so important and urgent?

Every now and then, throughout various workplaces, I have encountered users who use exclamation marks as if they were just regular punctuation, or sometimes like commas.

"Maintenance guy ""fixed"" the copier and causes several thousand $'s in damage.","TL:DR - ""Maintenance"" guy thinks he's a copier tech, FUBARS several thousand $ of equipment and gives the office a toner makeover.

Back when I worked as a field repair tech our standard response time was get to the customer within 24 business hours. If you called in on a Friday late in the day, you'd most likely see me monday morning/noon. I think this story happened 2006ish.

We got a call from a doctors office on a Friday around 3pm saying the copier had an error message. Said error message was ""replace toner waste container"".

Normally this can be done by the end user but this particular MFP (multi function printer/copier) had one that had to be replaced by a tech. The copier they had used a waste container that could hold about 5lbs of waste toner and was held inside the machine in the back under some covers so a tech had to be dispatched to take things apart and do some general cleaning when these containers needed replaced.

Now this customer was a good hour and a half drive from dispatch so I called them and informed them I'd be up first thing Monday morning. Unfortunately this meant the MFP would be down till I got there but not much I could do unless they wanted to pay an after hours fee for me to get there same day. They said it was fine, they had other printers and would see me Monday. Cut to Monday morning and I walk into their  office and EVERYTHING (I do mean EVERYTHING) was covered in a fine black powdery film. It looked like someone dropped a toner bomb in their office.

M=Me
R=Receptionist
D=Doctor

M: What on earth happened in here?!?

R: Our building maintenance guy said he could take care of the error code on the copier and he tried fixing it Saturday.

M: How? What? What did he do?

R: He said the error code just meant the container inside the front cover was full and needed emptied. So he took a shop-vac and just sucked it out.

M: He did WHAT!!!

R: I guess it was fine for a few seconds then the vacuum started blowing black everywhere. We've been trying to clean up since Saturday but this stuff doesn't clean up easy.

Now for those not in the know on toner, it's a VERY fine silica based powder that clings to everything, best way to clean it up is with a static cloth (similar to a super cloth) or with a SPECIAL vacuum that has a filter designed to keep toner in it otherwise you get a cloud of black death. Also being silica based it does NOT mix with water so using a cloth or paper towel with water/cleaner just smears it around.

I glance at the disaster that is their office and immediately go back to my car, grab an entire pack of static wipes, a dust filtration mask, my vacuum, and a pair of latex gloves. Upon returning I instruct the girls in the office that they should all be wearing masks and gloves due to this film being silica based, then hand out the cloths and instruct them how to use them (give em a bit of a stretch and go to town).

M: Ok, I need to see exactly what your ""maintenance"" guy did to the copier. Give me a while to see what he did and get the outside of the copier cleaned up so I can work on it.

I look at the copier and its turned off at the front switch, most copier have 2 switches: One for a low power shutdown, the other for complete shutdown, I reach behind and fully kill the power. After about 15 minutes of wiping down covers, controls, and everything in general and I finally open up the copier. The ""container"" the maintenance guy vacuumed out was not the waste tank, it was in fact the developer unit...

Again for those not in the know, a copier mixes toner into a developing unit that is filled with developer (a very fine metal powder). So not only did the maintenance guy blast the office with toner he also manage to suck out ever speck of developer and made it airborne.

I cleaned everything I could on the copier inside and out and then figured it'd be safe to power up and see the extent of the damage. Upon power up I immediately got a developer unit error code, no surprise there, so I power down, completely clean the DV unit and toss in a new bottle of developer. Power back up and run the neccessary service codes to recalibrate the DV unit. On the next reboot I can hear everything running and doing its usual start up until i get a laser unit error.

*RUT ROH, that's not good*

I reset the error and reboot the copier listening to hear if the laser spins up and again, error code.

*well shit*

Normally you dont touch laser units unless you know theres something wrong with them, I figured toner got inside the unit and was causing issues. So I rip out the laser and take it apart, sure enough toner was inside it on the mirrors but what worried me was the motor that ran the refection head was hard as hell to turn. My first thought was if toner got in, developer probably did as well. So I pull the motor out and clean it with isopropyl, dried the crap out of it with compressed air, and lubed the bearings with a drop of oil. It was spinning smoother but still a bit rough. Put everything back together and prayed. This time I could hear the laser trying to spin up but it still kept throwing the error code.

I figured it was time to call the boss and inform him of the situation. As soon as I told him what the maintenance guy did and the error codes the machine was having he said pack it up the machine is dead and nothing's going to be covered by warranty or their service contract. Inform the Doctor what was happening and if they want a quote for a replacement we'll be happy to get him one. I went back inside and informed the receptionist I needed to speak with Doctor about the situation.


D: I'm told you wanted to speak to me?

M: Yeah Doc, unfortunately your copier is dead and my boss doesn't even want to attempt to fix it due to what the maintenance guy did. It definitely killed the laser unit and probably more but we cant find out till the laser is replaced and it's about $500-600 just for the laser. If it killed the laser most likely all the other motors in the copier are dead or dying since the laser is one of the  more protected sections in the machine. Unfortunately none of this is covered under your maintenance contract since someone outside our company caused the damage. We can get you a quote for a new one and get it here ASAP if you want but a replacement with the same features is gonna be several thousand dollars.

*I honestly thought the doctor was going to go ballistic at this but he floored me with the following.*

D: Ok, get me a quote, but I want a better machine then this one with a stapler and hole punch.

M: Ok...? You're not upset?

D: No I already informed the maintenance company that does the cleaning that they're paying for all damages in my office. I have their employee on camera doing something he's not supposed to do and I was not asked if I wanted him to work on my equipment. I told them if they had an issue with that my lawyer would be delivering paperwork sueing for damages. They said the guy  was fired and I should email over any quotes or bills for replacements/repairs. So I'm going to get an upgrade on their dime.

M: Ok... I'll have a quote to you by end of today.

D: I also have 3 computers that aren't working do you think that this could have caused them to stop working?

M: Oh absolutely, if toner and developer got sucked into them it could of ruined the harddrive or fans. Maybe even shorted something if enough developer got on the boards (I explained what toner and DV was).

D: Ok, my IT guys are supposed to be here later today so I'll just have them do the same and replace them. Is there anything else you needed?

M: No, I'll get packed up and have that quote emailed over.

D: Ok, thank you.

I returned to my stuff and started packing up, I explained to the receptionist what was going on and apologized for not being able to do much.

R: That's ok, thanks for these cloths though, we're actually getting stuff cleaned up now.

M: Well have a better day and I'd keep the masks and gloves on till your done cleaning. You can keep the pack of cloths, you're going to need them.

"Sure, printer settings change on their own...","I'm not IT, I'm an electrician. But our IT team is understaffed so I tend to help them out with more misc tasks.

We have these huge industrial sterilization machines for pharma equipment. And whenever they complete a run, you have to print a protocoll and sign it. For that we have printers set up for every one of them.

Yesterday the IT team got calls that the printers aren't working. When I got there for my shift, they had been trying to get them running for 2 hours and couldnt figure out what was wrong. LAN didn't work. Direct cable connection didnt work. You couldn't ping the printers either. Paul (not his real name) was on it with his laptop trying all kinds of things that I'm not educated enough to understand, until he finally gave up and decided to just set up a new printer. 

Then my coworker and I got an idea. Apparently he never checked the printer settings. We have a lock on the display so no one can change settings but we thought hey,might as well try it.

I'm not IT, I'm an electrician. But our IT team is understaffed so I tend to help them out with more misc tasks.

We have these huge industrial sterilization machines for pharma equipment. And whenever they complete a run, you have to print a protocoll and sign it. For that we have printers set up for every one of them.

Yesterday the IT team got calls that the printers aren't working. When I got there for my shift, they had been trying to get them running for 2 hours and couldnt figure out what was wrong. LAN didn't work. Direct cable connection didnt work. You couldn't ping the printers either. Paul (not his real name) was on it with his laptop trying all kinds of things that I'm not educated enough to understand, until he finally gave up and decided to just set up a new printer. 

Then my coworker and I got an idea. Apparently he never checked the printer settings. We have a lock on the display so no one can change settings but we thought hey,might as well try it.

She decided to replace the toner cartridges herself. Big mistake.,"I've only been in IT for two years, but today I stumbled into the most ridiculous user error I've seen yet.

A user, who I'll refer to as ""Audrey"", had very little toner remaining in her personal HP multi-functional printer, so I ordered in some new cartridges for her. It was one of each colour; CMYK. At their arrival, I placed them in her office and told her to let me know when the print quality starts to turn bad, and I'll replace the cartridges for her.

Some weeks later I go by her office and notice a bunch of toner cartridges strewn around her desk. ""Are these the old cartridges?"" I ask myself. I look at the printer supplies status and they're still low. ""Strange. Did she fail to replace them?"". I track her down and ask her what's going on with the toner situation.

Audrey: ""I messed it up. I broke them.""  
Me: ""How?""  
Audrey: ""I snapped something off.. on three of the cartridges.""

I'm thinking it was just some piece of plastic or something attached from the packaging, no big deal. After all, how could something so simple go wrong? You literally open and pull out a little shelf on the printer, take the old one out and put in the new one. This particular replacement procedure is one of the most straightforward designs I've seen on most printers.

We went to the office and she handed me one of the cartridges, along with the snapped piece. It was worse than I thought. It was the actual electronic chip that needs to be read by the printer to know the status of the toner. It wasn't even torn out as one whole piece, but **snapped in half**, and she had done this **three** times. Only the black toner survived.

Me: \*in disbelief\* Why did you do this?  
Audrey: The old toner didn't have that piece there, and the instructions said something about removing or pulling something off..

The old ones were HP toner cartridges, and I ordered Xerox ones. They were compatible, but had slightly different appearance. She was smart enough to remove the plastic guard, and she had pulled the tab for removing the protection strip, but somehow she thought the electronic chip had to go too, because it wasn't in the same spot as the HP brand cartridges?

Wherein a close friend struggles with both printers and a penny wise dollar foolish boss.,"Not about me, but one of my friends also in the IT business. 

He inherited admin status of a site which started out as 4 workstations and grew pretty haphazardly till he got a hold of it at 60 workstations and a slew of peripherals. 

The thing is, before he got there every department was basically given free reign to get whatever software and hardware that they wanted to do their job, within a certain budget. 

Meaning there was no cohesion at all, no standardization. 

He had 15 printers of an astounding array of makes and models, all with their own ink. 

Not even joking, an entire enclosed office was dedicated just for storing ink. 

And a lot of those printers were so old that the manufacturers didn't even make ink for them anymore, and he had to hunt ebay and refill services to fill requirements, and half of which was unusable on arrival due to age anyway. 

So one of his first projects was to standardize the printers. 

So he brought the owner two proposals for managed print services, with reasonable cost per page and good reviews. 

Owner looked at the numbers and rejected it, and told Friend to just go buy new printers. 

So he bought 15 HP Officejets and set them up. 

The remaining printers were specialty, such as wide format or impact printing. 

One type of printer, one type of ink, every department can use every other department's inks, and the cost per page is close to what a managed service would offer. 

Fast forward 3 months, and there is noticeable savings on consumables, and reduced downtime, and everyone is happy. 

Until...

Owner hears about refillable tanks from a fellow business owner (who has exactly 2 printers), and starts seeing more dollars he can trim off the bottom line, and orders my friend to implement it on all printers. 

&gt;Friend: That's not a good idea, at most you'll be saving maybe $30 a printer per month, and you run the risk of damaging the printheads. 

&gt;Owner: My buddy told me that was bs, and he's been running tanks for years with no problems. 

&gt;Friend: And your buddy has 2 printers and their already ancient to begin with so their printhead screens are big enough to let boulders through.

&gt;Owner: What does that have to do with it?

&gt;Friend: Modern printers have finer printhead screens, the ink needs to be a much higher quality than most refill places can handle, and the ones that _can_ do it will basically charge you what a retail cartridge would cost. 

&gt;Owner: Look, it's just ink. I know you're defensive about this project, but IT is a cost center and we need to reduce your department's drain as much as possible. 

Friend literally bit a decent scrap out of his inside cheek hearing this and kept having to swallow his own blood trickle for the rest of the 'talk'. 

&gt;Friend: Every printer that fails will come out of our pocket as they will not honor a warranty replacement caused by non-OEM ink, and they'll know we're using a tank even before the printer fails. They can't legally stop us from doing it, but they have spent more than a million dollars on software and research to make sure as fuck they know when we do. 

&gt;Owner: It's your job to keep it running, it's my job to decide how to pay for it, so bring me 3 proposals for tank systems by the end of the day and we will move forward with the best one. 

They chose a system, my friend installed it, and within two weeks the first printhead failed. 

Within a month 3 printers were down. 

&gt;Owner: Can't you just change the printheads? They can't be that expensive. 

&gt;Friend: The entire reason this printer is so fast and ink efficient is that it's a full page printer. The print head is actually 20% of the lower mechanism and it is not only not intended to be serviced by end users, replacing them is such a pain in the ass that HP just replaces the entire printer instead of trying to repair our existing one. But not in our case, because, you know, non-OEM ink...

&gt;Owner: Just reassign users on the broken printers to the closest working one to them, I'm not paying for replacements. 

Friend sighs and does as ordered. 

Within the next 5 months, a total of 9 out of 15 printers fail, employees are complaining about lining up at printers, getting the wrong print jobs, and having to walk a few more feet than they are normally used to. 

Of course all this hate comes squarely down on my friend's shoulders, and when your users hate IT, that's when things start to get really bad. 

Finally, close to a year after the tank swap, HP sends out a firmware update and support refuses to even work on a machine until the update is applied. 

So he applies the update. 

Within a week the remaining 6 all die mysteriously, all with print head failures. 

Now I'm not saying HP updated their firmware to brick non-OEM ink using printers, but that's a pretty short time to have 6 printers die at once. 

That said, they were in a bind, Owner blamed Friend, and then 'came to the rescue' with the idea of hiring a print management service, using all the datapoints and even the service provider that Friend had proposed during the initial plan. The department heads all comment how smart that is, and chide Friend for not thinking of that in the first place and putting everyone though all this trouble for his 'pet project'. 

Friend goes home and downs a handle of vodka because speaking up would cost his job.

Wish I had a happier ending for you all, but real life doesn't often play out like a story.

The tale of the HVAC vendor mix up....,"List of characters:

&gt;Me: just-out-of-school system admin / network engineer  
&gt;  
&gt;Boss:  he's been out of the tech side for about 20 years but great people skills  
&gt;  
&gt;Senior network engineer: my mentor - great guy but hates documenting anything.  He's one of those ""rack it and toss the box and user manual away"" guys  
&gt;  
&gt;HVAC vendor: poor guy who doesn't understand why our shop is so unorganized. (I keep wondering that too!)

\-------------------------------------------------

Boss: ""Take photos of the racks and send it to our HVAC vendor so they can calculate our heatload.""

Me (confused because that didn't make sense): ""Sure.  I'll do it today. What's their email or phone number?""

(You may be asking why I said ""sure!"".  I've learned in my 2 months at this job that asking him clarifying questions is useless because he'll just dig in deeper, explaining why his instructions are correct. I know my next step is to go to the source and see what they actually needed.)

Boss gives me the rep's email address.  I email him, asking them to clarify what they need.  (And no, I didn't repeat my boss' instructions, hoping to save him some face.)

Of course, I miss their call - I was replacing a user's monitor that decided to output technicolor static.

Vendor, via voicemail: ""I talked to your boss last night.  I just need those photos and then I'm good.""

I left another voicemail and sent another email, adding my boss' instructions and asking if that was really what they needed.

I waited until lunchtime but got no reply, so  I went into the server room and did as instructed - took detailed photos of Rack #1 only and sent them with ""Is this really what you want?!?!?!""

THAT finally got them to call me back.

Vendor: ""We don't need photos of your racks.  We need photos of the nameplates!""

Me: ""Yeah, that's not going to happen.  Those nameplates are usually on the top or bottom of the equipment and we're racked up really tight in there.  I can't get a piece of paper in there, never mind my cell phone.  And no, I'm not unracking live equipment, no matter how much you beg.""

Vendor: ""Well, do you have an inventory or user manuals or something we can get information off of?""

Me (knowing my department has never been big on documentation): ""All I have is what you just got - photos of our racks.""

\*silence\*

I finally told them I'd figure something out for them and hung up.

I go to my senior network engineer, just in case there was a miracle, and asked him: ""The HVAC vendor wants to know what we have running in the server room so they can pull a better BTU calculation.  Do we have an inventory of what's on the racks?""

He stares at me like a dear stuck in headlights.

Me: ""I'll take that as a no...""

So, I spent most of my free time yesterday afternoon in the server room, pulling brand names and models off of the hardware in there.

"The Mini, The Pole And The Plant Pot...","My office is located at an activity centre in a rural area. Until relatively recently the only options for connectivity were ADSL lines (5mbit on a good day), Leased Lines (very expensive due to needing to pull fibre 16km/10 miles so it was never really an option) and ISDN/T1 services over copper. Then our local telco supplier started offering Fibre to the Premises connections for much less than what a leased line cost, so we went from our 5mbit ADSL to a 300/30mbit link and the world was a better place...

... That was until one afternoon, just before the long Easter weekend where I was planning on having a quiet time with family. I'd just finished walking the 1.5 mile /2.4km route home when I got a call from my boss saying ""Be warned, your office might call, they've lost their internet connection. They said something about an accident...""

Now, being the curious sort I got home, jumped in the car and headed back up to the office. Turns out the ""accident"" was an unfortunate person in a new type MINI Estate/Station Wagon, who'd managed to come together with a telephone pole. Quite a serious coming together in fact. The pole had been sheered off at the base, all the wiring ripped out and the pole deposited on the road. A right old mess of things.

Problem was, this telephone pole carried \*all\* of the site connectivity across a main/trunk road:

The FTTP Fibre  
The 12-line ISDN service  
And a 20-core cable that carried about 5 voice/ADSL lines

The only positives were that the driver of the MINI was unharmed and that there was one less MINI estate on the road. As there was no chance of getting services back that day I simply called our comms suppliers and headed for home.

The next day there was no sign of any telco response, so I plonked myself in the canteen (the only part of the building with mobile phone service) and worked via my laptop and a mobile data hotspot. The other issue was that all the site phone numbers had been forwarded to my mobile so I had to ""handle"" all communications for the site. I struggled on waiting for the telco to come out to repair things, and fortunately it was a pretty quiet few days.

Unfortunately, this repair seemed to be rather down the priority list for the telco. We got one chap who started fault finding one of the lines (which was with a different provider to the others). Problem was he was mystified he couldn't get a dial tone or anything on any of the lines. It was only by chance I saw him as I passed work in the car and pointed out that the cable for that line was currently buried in a hedge. I may have ruined his plan to claim Easter weekend overtime with that particular bit of information...

As the days wore on we started thinking of how to get some kind of connectivity back. The main issue with this site was that it was a converted manor house with very thick walls (so mobile service didn't penetrate the building). What this meant was that the only areas with mobile service were those with large glazed areas like the canteen. Fortunately the canteen had an AP mounted near the window with a power socket next to it. We then came up the idea of grabbing a 4G Based router that would take a corporate SIM, tuning it up to give the same IP range as out main router and plugging it in. All we had to do was find somewhere with signal to stash the router...

...Enter the random plant pots stacked along the windowsill. These were obivously located where there was plenty of sunlight, and a quick test with a mobile phone showed there was a decent signal available. We stuffed the router behind one of the plant pots (to discourage any playing with it), ran the cable up the wall to the AP's socket (near the ceiling), pulled the normal router/firewall out of service and we got back a very basic service level back. Luckily we had a couple of 3G femtocells so we could get mobile services working in the building and divert all the calls to someone else's mobile.

Now we thought we'd only need to do this for a couple of days until the telco got themselves sorted. Unfortunately the telco were in no hurry, and it took 2.5 weeks for us to get service back despite putting escalations and complaints through to everyone that anyone had a contact for. During this our supplier (who had to deal with telco) were getting reports and excuses. One excuse read, and I quote:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Unfortunately the company that is contracted to do the local replacement has had their site broken into, stock stolen and the vehicles vandalised.

So apparently they'd run out of service vans and/or spare poles! Of course, it would be cynical of me to suspect that the real reason was that a local council had just core drilled through the main fibre for North West Wales just up the road and they didn't have enough fibre repair techs available to do both jobs at once...

Anyways, the job was finally completed at the end of the 2.5 weeks with 8 telco vans, a pole erection truck a traffic light control team and a veritable army of techs. After an all-day job we finally had all the services back online (with nary a crossed pair in the 20-pair!). I dread to think how much it cost the driver's insurance, as a set of traffic lights on a trunk road is £1,000 on its own, plus £1,000 to replace a pole, plus 9 techs for the day, plus our compesnation claim for two weeks 4G use (suffice to say I've bought cheaper cars than that bill!).",162,0,1,"The Mini, The Pole And The Plant Pot... My office is located at an activity centre in a rural area. Until relatively recently the only options for connectivity were ADSL lines (5mbit on a good day), Leased Lines (very expensive due to needing to pull fibre 16km/10 miles so it was never really an option) and ISDN/T1 services over copper. Then our local telco supplier started offering Fibre to the Premises connections for much less than what a leased line cost, so we went from our 5mbit ADSL to a 300/30mbit link and the world was a better place...

... That was until one afternoon, just before the long Easter weekend where I was planning on having a quiet time with family. I'd just finished walking the 1.5 mile /2.4km route home when I got a call from my boss saying ""Be warned, your office might call, they've lost their internet connection. They said something about an accident...""

I did the basic rookie mistake of not checking the previous tickets,"I had a ticket laying in the backlog, the ticket was described by the user like: ""I can't report invoices to the bank, excel is not working as it should. Files are opening automatically on their own. Before, there had been no such problems.""

As usual in the IT world, users don't really give much detailed information (blessed be the exceptions). And this user was no exception. When did it stop working, what they did before the issue popped up, what they tried to remedy the issue yadda yadda.

So yesterday I finally decided to call them after like 2 days of this ticket laying dormant (I just utterly hate excel tickets as they're the worst to solve), called them and connected remotely to the computer. I asked all sorts of questions needed to troubleshoot and told them, if the user could show me what they did.

The user naturally didn't really know any IT terms so they explained it to me as: ""I clicked here. This button. Then there's a document generated. But it opens up automatically in Excel, it should be like imported to the bank and confirmation email should arrive. I just drag the button and that's it. And when I got back to the browser, the button doesn't show.""

I had REALLY no idea. The user's description – even if they tried their best – was not really sufficient. I couldn't even comeup with a followup question besides ""where did the button appear?""

""Down.""

So I had to start somewhere right? I searched through our KBs if we have anything about that particular webapp. Nothing. Then I spent some time googling this shit. Nothing again. After 10-15 minutes, I finally began thinking about how to commit a suicide because this issue is not documented and I'm gonna be the first one and that this issue will be a very complicated one.

Then it hit me. As I was playing around the site, the site had a specific area called ""drag your documents here"". The user told me they ""just drag the button and that's it"". I connected the dots and I had the resolution. The webapp works in such a way that it generates a downloadable .csv report which then the user must manually import into the accounting system of the bank. Most of the work is done automatically, the user must only do one simple thing and that's it. But the user made a missclick and while the site was generating the report, the user checked the option ""always open files of this type after downloading"". Obviously, they would open in Excel first. Turns out that the ""button"" the user dragged was the file to be downloaded in Google Chrome.

Today, the same user has called me. The same problem. The same description. So I've searched through all of their tickets in order to find the number of the one I created yesterday so all I had to do was simply log a ticket and refer to the old one's solution. Besides mine, there were 4 other very old tickets with the same user and the same issue, all of them the same resolution.

No. Just no.,"Hey guys!

I'm back again!

So, here's the latest from my little world of server support.

I got a call from a very, very large fashion company. CPU voltage error. No big deal, it's something I could take care of in my sleep.

&gt;""Do we have logs from the server you can provide?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""No, I don't, and I'm not even sure if the LOM is configured.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""No worries, that CPU voltage error is generally resolved by firmware updates. Can we do that?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Not right now, no, I can't make any changes without a series of change requests. But let me go see if we can do that.""

So a few days go by, and I get an email explaining that they can't do the updates because a monitor didn't work when connected to their system, and they wanted one of our techs to come out and troubleshoot that as well as run the firmware updates.

So I very clearly let them know that what they're asking for is generally done by one of their folks, and if they want one of our techs to do it, it would be an additional charge.

So I expected them to refuse to pay and just send one of their guys out. They didn't. So I quoted them the price, but it wouldn't let me finish because the system was actually registered to the reseller said fashion company bought it from. I could see the price, though, so I told them around how much it would be, and told them they need to complete an ownership change before I can complete it.

So another day goes by, and I come into an email telling me that there would be no ownership change, and we need to set it up such that the US arm of the fashion company would pay for the quote.

Now, I don't know if you guys can read, but I said a paragraph up that I couldn't complete the quote, and that they need to change ownership before I can do that. Evidently, despite being told this very thing, they think I can just make us charge the US branch of their company for an addition to a server's warranty that, according to our system....they don't own.

Updates to come, I figure you guys will appreciate it.",951,0,1,"No. Just no. Hey guys!

A Tail as Old as Thyme.,"So I work for a large Medical Healthcare Group, which owns and operates hospitals over several states. I got a message from my supervisor this morning. He asks if I have been to MainStreet Outpatient Care. In fact I live within fifteen minutes of them, and pass them on my way home from work each day. 

My supervisor explains that their new, very expensive label printer is not working. They have been on the phone with tier 1 for an hour and a half, and want a tech on site. Now this printer handles printing of labels, scripts, and a bunch of other vital things. It also cost more than some vehicals. 

Sure. no problem. Got it boss. I grab my kit and head on over. Once on site, I see the printer all hooked up, with a nice long string of printed labels, which nurses are busy applying to samples of all sorts of things. Inwas initially confused, as I thought the printer wasn't working.

I am greeted by the head nurse, who explains the vast importance of this printer, and how they must have it repaired immediately, without any cost or downtime. They can't afford the time or money for a replacement. They need a #PermenentSolution and they need one now. 

I go through the basics. Cables, power, settings, are all good. The network tests well. The printer reports the proper ip address and I can connect to it via IP, no problem. Internal settings are all perfect. The printer drivers on the controlling computer are all up to date. I do some test prints. All work fine. The printer reports everything is ready to go. 

I ask the staff to push a label to the printer through their workflow software... Nothing. 

It turns our that the print works perfectly... if you ask it to reprint a label. Normally the labels are automatically entered when the patient is registered as needing lab work. When that hits the system, connections are made, things are recorded, numbers drawn up, and a label with all the particulars is supposed to print. A nurse then collects the appropriate container for whatever is going to be collected, slaps the label on. And hands it off to the nurse who is doing the collecting. A simple and smooth process that is ruined by the fact that the printer won't print until someone clicks the small warning icon and selects ""reprint"".

This is a disaster reaching apocalyptic proportions. I double check everything. I check the workflow software. I check the printer settings. I even check the cables again... and then I see it. 

That error message, the one that shows up when the label is generated, says that it can't find the printer. But it specifically says it can't find ""ManeStreetPrinter-01"" Mane Street. MANE Street.

Scholarly Mainframe Hijinks,"All of this recent VAXery has me remembering fondly of my father teaching me ZORK and KINGDOM on the university mainframe. Sitting late at night in the main office, staring at an old amber monitor, completely absorbed in the fate of an ASCII hero, as my father toiled away over statistical models on the neighboring terminal.

This is not my tale. It is a tribute to tales told to me by my father.

My father, aged and very much retired, was a professor of Political Science back in the days when statistical analysis was mostly theoretical. Old enough to predate Blalock's seminal publishing on the topic. Likewise, mainframes back then were the Big Iron joy that I know several of you suspender'd ancients toiled over hot registers on.

I'm not saying he predated cardboard, but I fairly sure he was around to see the first punchcard be smithed out of it.

Dad was (and is, still) an empiricist. He gets very grumpy with the reverse. Real-world proof beats hypothetical wishery 99.9% of the time, error margin of &lt;0.001%, he maintains to this day. Before Big Iron, he'd do all of his analysis by hand. Giant stacks of yellow foolscap paper pads, all with meticulously plotted equations.

Dad did multivariate regression by hand. God save him.

So when the university said ""we're buying one of those newfangled electronic computer thingies"", Dad pestered everyone up to the Dean (according to departmental peers) to make sure his department got time on the schedule.

Dad taught himself to program. Dad taught himself to load programs by punchcard. Dad badgered the departmental chairman into buying their own punchcard type-machine, and then apparently horded it in his office until it was stolen one night by his peers. This began a game of equipment hot-potato, as the punch-writer made the rounds of people's offices, desk, file cabinets and the like until the chairman put their foot down and had it chained to a desk in the main office.

Apparently, akin to the military, there is only one thief, everyone else is just trying to get the punch-writer back.

For his part in the above, Dad had to help the entire department learn to program and to use the punchcard-writer. Thus where the hijinks begin.

As time has gone on, I have come to realize that nerds are nerds no matter the discipline. Mild sociopathery included. Dad's peers took to programming like fish to water, and mainframe access to hyenas to fresh meat. They learnt that the early sessions could be 'preempted' from other terminal sessions. They learnt that the early email structures could be tampered with. 

In one case, one of Dad's peers had built a very specific punchcard, that when inserted anywhere into a stack of punchcards, would instruct the mainframe to diagonally stripe-print messages over any output.

The thought of what got printed, I leave up to you. Keep in mind that for all their learn'ed, scholarly gravitas, many professors are still schoolkids at heart, and swear like sailors (just in N languages, usually).

In addition, said peer was the departmental jester. For all of you in IT, consider the terror this could engender when the class clown also programs at a reasonably skilled level.

Having met the man in question, I would never have guessed it for he was a very nice man I thought, and Dad, for his part, mentioned but a few situations involving data-pranks that were ascribed to him, if not conclusively proven. The one I recall the most clearly was Dad mentioning that, late in one summer, he once had to stay up for almost an entire weekend straight, guarding the punchcard reader, to make sure the sixth copy of a governmentally-commissioned report did not go out to a minister with commentary striped across it discussing current governmental policy, the mental attributes of the current council, and the size and capability of the minister's unmentionables. 

For someone, with a special card, had been working their magic the entire previous week. To the point of enlisting peers to distract Dad so some quick slight-of-hand would render several hours of output rather, well, George Carlin-esque. Deadlines being deadlines, Dad apparently complained loudly enough to the chairman to ensure that the chairman spoke with said jester.

Later, the chairman told Dad that he had secured through threats and promises that a certain someone would not be in the office over the weekend, so he had all that time to do said work. Dad said he then asked he the chairman had taken a peer's office keys from him for said weekend. The chairman replied with words to the effect of ""That's insulting, I wouldn't do that. It'll be fine.""

So Dad camped out the entire weekend.

On Monday, Dad arrived at the office. Tired, grumpy, but joyful, for the printing had been done. His peer was in the office that morning, and Dad related how he triumphantly finished his work, without his peers commentary either! His peer congratulated him, and then asked which of the 300-level classes he'd be teaching in the fall. Dad, for his part, who had recently ducked out on those courses due to seniority, asked for clarification, to wit his peer explained that on the previous Friday, the chairman had come by to plead Dad's case. 

His peer listened, and explained that he'd never tamper with Dad's output like such, and that he'd be fine with sharing the computer access, but that since he'd lost out to Dad on course-assignments for that Fall, he was planning on re-writing his assigned 300-level coursework over the weekend and they'd share the terminal access. A discussion ensued, and having plead his case (and noted that Dad still had the previous year's coursework available), extracted a promise from the chairman to redo the course assignments, and furthermore, that in return, he'd ensure that he never set foot into the office the entire weekend. So he'd left town for the entire weekend for his lakeside cottage.",113,0,1,"Scholarly Mainframe Hijinks All of this recent VAXery has me remembering fondly of my father teaching me ZORK and KINGDOM on the university mainframe. Sitting late at night in the main office, staring at an old amber monitor, completely absorbed in the fate of an ASCII hero, as my father toiled away over statistical models on the neighboring terminal.

This is not my tale. It is a tribute to tales told to me by my father.

My father, aged and very much retired, was a professor of Political Science back in the days when statistical analysis was mostly theoretical. Old enough to predate Blalock's seminal publishing on the topic. Likewise, mainframes back then were the Big Iron joy that I know several of you suspender'd ancients toiled over hot registers on.

I'm not saying he predated cardboard, but I fairly sure he was around to see the first punchcard be smithed out of it.

Dad was (and is, still) an empiricist. He gets very grumpy with the reverse. Real-world proof beats hypothetical wishery 99.9% of the time, error margin of &lt;0.001%, he maintains to this day. Before Big Iron, he'd do all of his analysis by hand. Giant stacks of yellow foolscap paper pads, all with meticulously plotted equations.

Dad did multivariate regression by hand. God save him.

So when the university said ""we're buying one of those newfangled electronic computer thingies"", Dad pestered everyone up to the Dean (according to departmental peers) to make sure his department got time on the schedule.

Dad taught himself to program. Dad taught himself to load programs by punchcard. Dad badgered the departmental chairman into buying their own punchcard type-machine, and then apparently horded it in his office until it was stolen one night by his peers. This began a game of equipment hot-potato, as the punch-writer made the rounds of people's offices, desk, file cabinets and the like until the chairman put their foot down and had it chained to a desk in the main office.

Apparently, akin to the military, there is only one thief, everyone else is just trying to get the punch-writer back.

For his part in the above, Dad had to help the entire department learn to program and to use the punchcard-writer. Thus where the hijinks begin.

As time has gone on, I have come to realize that nerds are nerds no matter the discipline. Mild sociopathery included. Dad's peers took to programming like fish to water, and mainframe access to hyenas to fresh meat. They learnt that the early sessions could be 'preempted' from other terminal sessions. They learnt that the early email structures could be tampered with. 

In one case, one of Dad's peers had built a very specific punchcard, that when inserted anywhere into a stack of punchcards, would instruct the mainframe to diagonally stripe-print messages over any output.

The thought of what got printed, I leave up to you. Keep in mind that for all their learn'ed, scholarly gravitas, many professors are still schoolkids at heart, and swear like sailors (just in N languages, usually).

In addition, said peer was the departmental jester. For all of you in IT, consider the terror this could engender when the class clown also programs at a reasonably skilled level.

Outsourced employee making a series of wrongdoings that leads to loosing the job.,"My company during the pandemic and summer vacation times outsourced alot of tech support jobs.  
These externals usually screw up quite often, but they are not doing it by purpose and these screwups aren't really catastrophic. Now, this time this wasn't a regular case of ""i had a poor intro education for the job so i didn't know any better"", this is something that lead to a person loosing the job.

A regular day, a regular call came in, it was at first a regular case.  
The customer needed help finding the Lan socket the customer will connect the router to, easily enough i helped them find it and the link poped up green on the routers wan socket. Great! i thought, easy, clean and another happy customer.

Then the internet didn't work, the customer was redirected to a website to buy a connection.  
Now this was a city network i didn't have systems for, and i started looking through the installation details, this is where i started to notice something odd.

I asked.  
Me: You mentioned you had moved recently, is that correct?  
C: Yes, we just moved in and we talked to you (reffering to my company) about this about a week ago.  
Me: I understand. Have you recently recieved an confirmation email for an order?  
C: No.. i thought that was odd, usually you get those.

Now i started understanding what has happened and went into the order system to look at the details.  
When the customer called in 27th may they got a 12month deal on the broadband connection, making them bound to us for 12 months. Then 4th sep they called us to move the connection because they are bound to my company due to the deal. The external that took the call and instead of just simply pressing one button to move the connection from one adress to another. This external removed the old connection completely. Then ordering a new connection.

Now, this is wrong on so many levels i have to make a list to count them.

1: Ordering a new subscription on a regular move case customer.  
2: Removing the old subscription manually by termination of the old terms to the binding deal from 27th of may. (Like a regular termination but with the debut of the remaining binding time).  
3: Ordered the wrong deal to the new adress for the customer.  
4: Didn't correct the new binding time of the new subscription to match the old binding time, effectivly increasing the binding time effect for the customer by about 4 months with the wrong deal.  
5: Didn't remove the debute of the remaining binding time from the old subscription. Making the customer get an invoice of about 300$.  
6: Didn't remove the installation fee of about 30$.  
7: Removed the need for the customer to return the router which the customer hired from my company manually, but didn't remove the mailing of a router which comes as a standard to enw customers (there is a button to remove it).  
8: Didn't give the customer any information about the binding time, new price, installation date, installation invoice, new router, how to connect the router on the new adress that has a lan socket instead of a fiber converter.

It took me about 1.5 hours to correct all this. So i got a bit salty because this was not a regular misstake, this was in purpose just to be able to klick a new subscription sale. Plus all of this could be avoided by just doing a regular move that would take about 2min to do (But no sale).  
I emailed the boss to this external and gave the boss a breif and asked the boss to look at the case.  
Two days passed and the boss thanked me for the information and told me actions had been taken accordingly to the case.

I looked up this external's employee ID and saw that it was inactive since 26hrs ago.  
This means that the ID is no longer in use and the external does no longer work for the company that we outsourced to.  
This was a bit odd, because in my country its rare and hard to be kicked out like that, it would take several offenses before actions like that would be taken. So i guess that this person had done similar things before, well, have fun finding a new job!

But it won’t go away,"About 20+ years ago, I worked as tech support for a telephone company. At this time caller Id and internal voicemail were new and most folks didn’t have a clue how to use them. The team I worked on (about 30 people) were constantly training to keep up with the changes.  I had worked for this company about a year and I loved it. Every day there was a different problem to solve.  
A couple days after Christmas, I received a call from an older gentleman.
Me: Thank you for calling (company name) my name is (me) how may I assist you?
Customer: Hello?? Are you real or that computer voice again?
Now I’m very used to this response due to the fact that my professional “phone” voice sounds similar to the computerized voice on the choice menu the customers have to navigate to reach me.
Me: (chuckling) At last check I was human.
Customer: I need help with this caller Id my granddaughter got me for Christmas. 
Me: I’ll be more than happy to help you with this, first let me check that we have the service on your line.
Customer: I called customer service the day after Christmas and had it added.
Me: (after verifying that the service was active) How May I help you, Sir?
Customer: Well I’m getting calls but I can’t see who’s calling. It’s like the letters and numbers are all scrambled. 
Me: Oh, that’s not good. Let’s just go through a couple of tests here. 
I take him through making sure the box is connected correctly (it is), making sure the language is set to English (it is), and everything else I can think of. I even got the manual out to check if there was anything I might be missing. There wasn’t.
After thirty minutes of attempting to help this customer (I even called repair dept to ask for assistance and they were no help) I was as frustrated as the customer.
After speaking with the customer for a few more minutes it finally dawned on me what was wrong.
Me: Sir, would you do something for me?
Customer: Throw this darn thing against the wall?
Me: No sir. On the top right side of the display, would you please see if the display sticker is still attached.
The customer was silent for a few seconds.
Customer: Would you like me to bend over now so you can kick me?
Me: (lol) Inly is you kick me first.
Customer: Thank you for all your help.
Me: My pleasure. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

User reported me to my boss for not telling her to copy her shortcuts to the shared drive,"I'm the lowest person on the totem at work, so I have the job of hunting down and upgrading the last of the Win7 computers in our organization.  Since many of these computers are ancient, we're replacing them with brand new computers straight from Dell.  This process ran well for most users and they are usually VERY happy with the upgrade....but today was different.

Today's user was in accounting.  She seemed a little wary about this whole procedure when I called her the week before.  The usual conversation happened - how many monitors do you have? what apps do you use?  when are you avail this week or next? etc etc.  One of the most important parts of this conversation was, ""If you have any files saved on your computer, you need to move them to the shared drive.  This include anything on the desktop or in your documents or download folder you want to keep because once your old computer is returned to the IT department, it will be tossed in the recycle pile, never to been seen again.""  She seemed to grasp the idea and even asked me, ""Everything?  All my documents and spreadsheets?""  ""Everything.""

I stopped by her office this morning with the Dell box and switched out her very ancient computer with a brand new one.  I added her printers, gave her a quick tutorial on Win10, made sure she had all her applications, and then headed back to my lair in the IT office.  

She called me an hour later, upset: 

User: ""Where are my shortcuts?""  

Me: ""I'm sorry.  What shortcuts?""  

User: ""The shortcuts on my desktop!  They're all gone!  What did you do to them?""

Me: ""Were these shortcuts on the desktop of your old computer?""

User: ""Yes!""

Me: ""You didn't copy them to the shared drive?""

User: ""You told me to copy all my files, not my shortcuts!  I thought they'd be on there when I booted up but they're not!""

After a moment of ""WTF, lady!?!?!?"", I calmly told her I'd be over in a few minutes to help her out.  I knew that kind of ""special user"" was going to need a little hand holding and she was so pissed off, trying to remote in to fix the problem would only escalate the problem.  Once in her office, I apologized for the mixup and showed her how to add shortcuts to her desktop.  After 10 minutes of instructions (because she wanted to do it all herself), she had all of her shortcuts back.

"Forklift, VAX. VAX, forklift. *CRUNCH*","A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ikz5ws/the_time_we_crashed_a_vax_by_osmosis/) by /u/AdoptsDEATHsCats reminded me of this.  This isn't my story; it's a story that [University Boss](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8l22x7/the_worst_epidemic_of_component_failures_ever/) told me many times.  Always accompanied by his jubilant, loud laugh.

Back in the day when floppies were still floppy, the university purchased a shiny new [VAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX).  It cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and was basically the size of several racks.  The hard drive was the size of a washing machine, [something like this](http://gunkies.org/wiki/RM80).

So these components arrive at the University by freight carrier on pallets.  From there, the union contract for physical plant stipulated that they must do the moving into position.  (I've also [written about them](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8i7whk/network_enlightenment_with_a_borderlineillegal/) before).

There sat the VAX, on pallets, by the wall in the warehouse.

The driver got on the forklift.  He drove towards the VAX as he usually did: fast, with the fork lowering towards the ground as he went.  He was probably annoyed at all the interest in it, and treated it like he did anything else: with as much care as one treats a pallet of cat litter.

At this point, I need to describe how University Boss would tell the story.  He'd gesture with his hands: one representing the VAX, and the other moving towards it, lowering slowly.

""So the forklift was driving towards the VAX, the fork was lowering, and then....  CRUNCH!   Hahahaha!""

Yes, the forklift encountered VAX before the fork encountered the ground.  It rapidly installed two large holes in the VAX - right through the [backplane](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/VAX_11_780_CPU_Backplane.jpg).  And when University Boss told the story, his laughter could be heard down the corridor -- despite the closed door to his office.

That may have been the most expensive second or two in the history of the university.

----
They eventually got the broken bits replaced and the VAX installed.  At one point while I was working there in the late 90s, I asked my boss to show it to me.  It still sat, powered down, in a now-dark server room.  Apparently they had finished the server room after the VAX was installed, and the doorway wasn't large enough to get it back out.  It remained there for several more years until that building got a renovation.",337,0,1,"Forklift, VAX.

Back in the day when floppies were still floppy, the university purchased a shiny new [VAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX).  It cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and was basically the size of several racks.  The hard drive was the size of a washing machine, [something like this](http://gunkies.org/wiki/RM80).

So these components arrive at the University by freight carrier on pallets.  From there, the union contract for physical plant stipulated that they must do the moving into position.  (I've also [written about them](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8i7whk/network_enlightenment_with_a_borderlineillegal/) before).

There sat the VAX, on pallets, by the wall in the warehouse.

The driver got on the forklift.  He drove towards the VAX as he usually did: fast, with the fork lowering towards the ground as he went.  He was probably annoyed at all the interest in it, and treated it like he did anything else: with as much care as one treats a pallet of cat litter.

At this point, I need to describe how University Boss would tell the story.  He'd gesture with his hands: one representing the VAX, and the other moving towards it, lowering slowly.

""So the forklift was driving towards the VAX, the fork was lowering, and then....  CRUNCH!   Hahahaha!""

Yes, the forklift encountered VAX before the fork encountered the ground.  It rapidly installed two large holes in the VAX - right through the [backplane](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/VAX_11_780_CPU_Backplane.jpg).  And when University Boss told the story, his laughter could be heard down the corridor -- despite the closed door to his office.

That may have been the most expensive second or two in the history of the university.

----
They eventually got the broken bits replaced and the VAX installed.  At one point while I was working there in the late 90s, I asked my boss to show it to me.  It still sat, powered down, in a now-dark server room.  Apparently they had finished the server room after the VAX was installed, and the doorway wasn't large enough to get it back out.  It remained there for several more years until that building got a renovation."
The Supervisor Tries To IT,"Hello everyone, I have a few stories I've wanted to share over the years, but this one happened earlier today and I needed to share it. Currently, I'm the technical lead for a major pharmacy company that does mail order prescriptions on a giant, automated system. I've got some stories working for the photography and tourism industry that I'd love to share later as well.

So tonight, one of my site supervisors calls me up and asks me to come to the little admin station within the facility where the workers on the line do their thing. It's just two tables with several monitors and docking stations for their #CorporateLaptops can dock into. Previously, we had the Vendor that manages the software and hardware of the system in and they had taken over this area. Walking up, the conversation goes roughly as follows :

$Supe1: Hey A\_Firestrawn, can you help me with something.

$Me: Sure $Supe1, what's going on?

$Supe1: So, I'm trying to set up the docking station for $Supe2, but I can't get the monitor to work. Can you take a look at it?

$Me: Absolutely!

So I go take a look, and I notice two very important details. 1) The Display Port cable is NOT plugged into the monitor. 2) The Docking Station appears to have 2 cables plugged into it. For all of us, we can all guess what had happened.

$Me: Hey $Supe1, I found your problem.

I say this as I begin uncoiling the single Display Port cable to show that both ends of the same cable were plugged into the docking station. $Supe1 and I share a laugh, and I inform them that they will never live this down.",835,0,1,"The Supervisor Tries To IT Hello everyone, I have a few stories I've wanted to share over the years, but this one happened earlier today and I needed to share it.

An interesting Data Archive,"So, back when I was an apprentice in an IT Office, there was this lady who had a very questionable request. Basicly, she calls in, and tells me to clean up her Desktop after she is done with work. Totally okay with that and questioning my life choices, I connect to her Desktop with Remotedesktop and a vpn tunnel. I delete some shortcuts that are double, put some stuff in new folders, create a shortcut to their network attached storage and finally, I empty her recycle bin.

1 day later I get an angry call. Asking me whats wrong with me and how I can be so reckless. Asking my self, what I may have done wrong in her eyes since the task was literally for toddlers, she tells me that she had important recipes and contracts IN HER RECYCLE BIN. Work for several months just got deleted. I then explained to her, what the recycle bins purpose is and that its generally not a good Idea to keep stuff in there, since if someone by accident emptys it everything is gone. I went ahead and tried to explain how to properly hide stuff on your C drive with folders, but she wouldnt listen and not even let me talk. She told me that she would contact a Lawyer and sue me etc etc. Luckily, the PC goes through a Backup Everyday, so I could restore her Recycle Bin. Now the lady happily still uses her recycle bin for important files.

Morale of the story: never empty customers recycle bins. Dont even try to show them a better way of hiding their stuff. They wont listen because they simply ""know it better""",240,0,1,"An interesting Data Archive So, back when I was an apprentice in an IT Office, there was this lady who had a very questionable request.

"When sales promise thousands of e-mails, per day, for her thousands of ""friends""...","Hello again everyone, hope your all &amp; well during the hump day as they call it! I posted a couple of day's ago regarding a customer and their e-mail issue:

[A decade worth of e-mails all gone, by the simple non clicking of a box, life is fun innit?](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/io5oqn/a_decade_worth_of_emails_all_gone_by_the_simple/)

Not all my tales to tell are e-mail related, but I had that one plus this one to share!

**Background:**

At the age of 36 I live in my home town in Scotland where I was born and grew up, went to school and have my current job in retail for nearly four years now. This tale, amongst others that follow in this subreddit are from my job before this, where I worked in a callcentre for a national broadband, phone &amp; tv provider. I was in the business faults for broadband/phone line dealing with customers either on the phone or live chat over the 10 and a half years I was there before I was let go (that is a story for another time) - this story is from at some point whilst working there. It's worth keeping in mind that any names of customers, me and the company I did work for have been changed obviously to protect identities.

**Cast:**

**Scotch:** Well, take a wild guess smart guy ;)

**MC:** Mis-Guided Customer

**COM:** Chilled Out Manager

**The Story:**

This was around mid to late 2011, I was on the front line technical support desk for \*shitty ISP\* before I was moved to the back office team I got this call from a customer.

*\*beep for the call\**

**Scotch:** Welcome to &lt;telco's business support line&gt; my name is Scotch, who am I speaking to today and how can I help?

**MC:** Hi, my name is MC and I have a simple query regarding your e-mail services, as I am recent sign up for your business account for one month but I am not able to send any?

**Scotch:** Sure, let me get some account details from you and lets see if we can get the problem fixed for you today MC.

*\*does account verification\**

**Scotch:** Thanks, from what I can see the account appears to be active, no barring or suspension from billings &amp; checking out outage board I see no outages for e-mail. Additionally my previous customer I dealt with had e-mail issues *(not the previous tale incase you are all wondering - this took place much later)* and by the end they where able to send. Talk me through how you send your e-mails so that I can see if we can fix it?

**MC:** I use *\*insert free to use ISP provided e-mail service\** and I was able to send OK, I use Microsoft Outlook - the full suite which I spent a bit of money from. I am getting some error messages on screen when I go to send them, I don't know what they mean.

**Scotch:** *(knowing that some customers don't know much about errors or are the best at relaying them over correctly to us)* What I would like to do is use to remote software to check out your setup there and see if we can resolve this today?

*Customer agree's to this and I get remoted into their machine, realising that they are using Windows 7, up to date and their using McAfee software, up to date and Windows Updates are fine.*

**Scotch:** After checking your system, it appears to be nothing your end, looking at the error message on screen it looks like to be an apparent blacklisting type error - if you give me a few minutes I am wanting to check out a things here for you. I will now disconnect from your screen now.

*As I check out her IP address, e-mail account on our end, with our mail suppliers etc...customer advises below.*

**MC:** No worries, you see when I signed up I told the sales guy's that I would be using this e-mail service to mail out my customers every day sales offers and vouchers with additional marketing information. I have thousands of followers on Facebook alone in addition to twitter *(this was before the day's of Instagram, influencers and spam e-mails died out)* so we are talking about a lot of e-mails I send, you see.

*By this point I had finished checking our blacklisting services and those of errors - if you have not guessed so by now I was able to see that she indeed had been blacklisted. Satisfied that it was not a virus on her computer sending out the spam, hijacked account or other problem, in addition to what she told me, I was braced for the fun of explaining this to her.*

**Scotch:** I understand completly **MC** about your situation, what I have been able to find out is that your mail account has been blacklisted on a couple of mail services online. Essentially what that means is that its a bit like someone going to a supermarket for their shopping then getting barred from entering, no longer being able to get inside anymore. Your e-mail account is the same, to a certain aspect, when you go to send your e-mails, we check your e-mail address and see that's it being stopped from sending to anyone - that's why you are not being able to send.

**MC:** WHAT?!?!?! I AM PAYING FOR A BUSINESS SERVICE, I AM A BUSINESS CUSTOMER PAYING FOR A PREMIUM SERVICE!!

*\*dreading how she will take the next info I was going to tell her\**

**Scotch:** I can confirm your account is our business account, yes, though the e-mail account you are using is the free to use one from \*shitty ISP\* that is only a basic e-mail account with limited features &amp; functionalities, One of the limits is that you can only send 200 e-mails per day, maximum with it. Additionally, if you are going to be sending that many e-mails per day, every day, for as you say marketing purposes, not just \*shitty ISP\* but other providers will see that as spam as well, due to the content of it. 

**MC:** but...but..I WAS PROMISED BUSINESS GRADE E=MAIL SERVICES THAT WHERE DYNAMIC, BACKED UP DAILY AND PROGRESSIVE!!!!

*For those who have ready my previous story know that at that time, backup services where not.a thing we done at that time, plus I am guessing sales used these buzzwords to ""Whooo"" her. At that time it was only a basic Outlook Web Access style system \*shitty ISP\* offered, before fully going over to Office 365 Premium with all these belts and whistles a few years later - so there was no other choice for the customer.*

**MC:** MY business needs these e-mails to survive, how am I meant o e-mail my thousands of followers and friends with deals and offers? You do realise that this is going to cost me money?

**Scotch:** For the information that sales gave you, I am sorry **MC,** truly I am - though without listening to the call I can't fully answer for what they said. In regards to the facts of the matter, what we can provide to you, the e-mail account is a basic mail account, as mentioned, with limitations on it. If we where to open it up to a fully featured exchange style service that you are looking for, not only would it cost \*shitty ISP\* thousands, but slow our services down for everyone. That is why we have these limits on them, which sales are fully aware of, to which I will feed this back to them, moving forward for you **MC,** the only thing that I can suggest is that you either use the social media platforms you mentioned to promote your business or going for a third party provider that offers exchange styled services. With more people using social media, compared to using traditional e-mail, you may hit your target audience better with that - but not through your current setup.

*I hear a few ""sums"" and ""ahs"" whilst she thinks over a few things.*

**MC:** *a bit downhearted after realising that she was lied too* \- Well thank you **Scotch** for explaining this too me - I just wish sales where honest and not lied to me, it's a shame that it went to this though I am sure there is something more that can be done? Can you put me through to a manager so I can discuss this further?

**Scotch:** I will certainly get through to a manager for you, to discuss this - though they may advise of the same mentioned earlier in the call. Please give me a few moments.

*I spoke to* ***COM (Chilled Out Manager)*** *about this - who was one of my previous managers, who was covering for someone and just happened to be in the next bay. He advised me to put the notes into the case for him, pass over the customer and leave it to him.*

**Scotch:** Ok there, I have spoken to my manager &amp; his name is **COM** \- he will take over for you.

*I passed the customer to the manager updating the case notes and went to do with other customers. It was a busy day, a few things and meetings happened - it was not until about three hours later before I caught up with him.*

**Scotch:** So, what happened to that customer then?

**COM:** Yeah, what a weird case eh? Well I spoke to the customer and advised them that we could not support her e-mail needs for what she needs, that she would be better off using the social media platforms for promotional materials. Who thinks that sending thousands of e-mails per day to people she does not know  is a good business idea anyway lol? Hopefully she will get something. 

**Scotch:** Yeah, she was mis-guided in her ideas on what e-mails where capable of and also by our sales team - not a good mix, but hopefully after us both telling her about using the social media platforms she will take that forward.

**COM:** I agree - did you put through the request for her account to be removed from black listings? I advised we done so, that it can take around 48 hours for the changes to take effect, for e-mail services to resume and use as normal? I also gave her credit for 6 months on her account for this (managers can do this - I could not).

**Scotch:** When I done the notes, I put through the request - thanks again boss man :)

**Random**

What made me choose this particular story over others? The previous one kinda sparked some memories of previous tales which I will tell in future, but also in the past week I learned that **COM** had passed away with cancer - it was all of a sudden, 10 day's from being diagnosed to dying leaving behind a wife and family. I will share other tales that feature him in the future, but this was the first that sprung to mind.

You aren't supposed to reuse those...,"Hey everyone,

I've been enjoying the posts in this sub for several weeks now and wanted to share one of my own tales. TL;DR at the bottom. This one is from about a decade ago when I was working as a dedicated printer technician for a small family own MSP in the Chicagoland area. The owners were good people, and if someone called in a problem that could be solved by changing out a toner cartridge or cleaning the ADF glass we would advise them to do so and save on the $129 minimum charge for us to come out. This typically resulted in winning over a long term customer, so the good practice had good results. 

This particular call the customer had spent over a thousand dollars trying to fix a problem that was caused by trying to save a few cents on purchasing new labels.

The user calls (a new customer) calls in because her HP LaserJet 4200/4250 is putting repeated marks down the page while printing. I advise her that it sounds like a bad cartridge, but she insists that she has just put a new cartridge in and it is still having the same problem. I advise her of the minimum charge, and she requests us to come out.

I dispatch shortly after and get on site. After printing out a test page and seeing what is clearly a label mark on the page. I immediately pull the cartridge out to find the guilty label firmly stuck to the toner drum and show it to her. She gives me a sheepish look and insists that it is brand new. I assure her that it happens all the time, clean the drum of all of the adhesive, slap it back in, and print off another page to make sure that we are all good.

Except the same pages looked the same. Better than before, but still with a label mark going down the page three times.

I pull the fuser out and find another label, except this one was melted to the fuser film. I tried to clean it off, but the film was toast.

I advise her that unfortunately, her printer will require a new fuser (a $350-400 repair if memory serves right). It is then that she tells me that the fuser has already been replaced twice this month by a previous company, which is why she called us. **Ouch**. The fuser that was in it was rebuilt (which were notorious for being bad) and I recommended that we install an OEM fuser to fix the problem. She was extremely reluctant to agree because of the amount of money that had already been put into repairs, but I showed her that replacing the fuser fixed the problem, and she eventually agreed to give the go-ahead. 

While I was doing the repair though and cleaning out the paper path of a bunch of adhesive junk throughout it, something just didn't seem right. This reoccurring label problem didn't seem to be the fault of two poorly rebuilt fusers. She had been using tray 2 to print labels (This model was notorious for jamming with anything other than plain paper in tray 2) so I advised going forward to only use the manual tray and hopefully avoid the problem and expensive repair in the future.

We printed several test pages that all looked great and everything seemed all set to go. I was all packed up and about to leave when I saw it happen.  She was taking the label sheet that she had just printed with and feeding it back into the printer to print on the unused labels. The common denominator had revealed itself!

I asked her about what she was doing, and she informed me that she only printed one or two addresses at a time, so to save money, she would reuse a sheet of labels until it was empty. I was shocked. It was such good intentions, but I had to explain to her about the toner fusing process, and as a byproduct, that she had just cost her company over a thousand dollars with three separate fuser installs by trying to save a few cents on new labels.

Moral of the story? Don't let your end-users reuse labels.

**TL;DR:** End-user tries to save her company by reusing labels and ends up causing $1,000+ in repairs.",340,0,1,"You aren't supposed to reuse those... Hey everyone,

I've been enjoying the posts in this sub for several weeks now and wanted to share one of my own tales. TL;DR at the bottom. This one is from about a decade ago when I was working as a dedicated printer technician for a small family own MSP in the Chicagoland area. The owners were good people, and if someone called in a problem that could be solved by changing out a toner cartridge or cleaning the ADF glass we would advise them to do so and save on the $129 minimum charge for us to come out. This typically resulted in winning over a long term customer, so the good practice had good results. 

This particular call the customer had spent over a thousand dollars trying to fix a problem that was caused by trying to save a few cents on purchasing new labels.

The user calls (a new customer) calls in because her HP LaserJet 4200/4250 is putting repeated marks down the page while printing. I advise her that it sounds like a bad cartridge, but she insists that she has just put a new cartridge in and it is still having the same problem. I advise her of the minimum charge, and she requests us to come out.

I dispatch shortly after and get on site. After printing out a test page and seeing what is clearly a label mark on the page. I immediately pull the cartridge out to find the guilty label firmly stuck to the toner drum and show it to her. She gives me a sheepish look and insists that it is brand new. I assure her that it happens all the time, clean the drum of all of the adhesive, slap it back in, and print off another page to make sure that we are all good.

Except the same pages looked the same. Better than before, but still with a label mark going down the page three times.

I pull the fuser out and find another label, except this one was melted to the fuser film. I tried to clean it off, but the film was toast.

I advise her that unfortunately, her printer will require a new fuser (a $350-400 repair if memory serves right). It is then that she tells me that the fuser has already been replaced twice this month by a previous company, which is why she called us. **Ouch**. The fuser that was in it was rebuilt (which were notorious for being bad) and I recommended that we install an OEM fuser to fix the problem. She was extremely reluctant to agree because of the amount of money that had already been put into repairs, but I showed her that replacing the fuser fixed the problem, and she eventually agreed to give the go-ahead. 

While I was doing the repair though and cleaning out the paper path of a bunch of adhesive junk throughout it, something just didn't seem right. This reoccurring label problem didn't seem to be the fault of two poorly rebuilt fusers. She had been using tray 2 to print labels (This model was notorious for jamming with anything other than plain paper in tray 2) so I advised going forward to only use the manual tray and hopefully avoid the problem and expensive repair in the future.

We printed several test pages that all looked great and everything seemed all set to go. I was all packed up and about to leave when I saw it happen.  She was taking the label sheet that she had just printed with and feeding it back into the printer to print on the unused labels. The common denominator had revealed itself!

The internet is shrinking,"To start, I am not in tech support officially, but my mom calls all the time for tech support since she got her own computer. I figured everyone would get a kick out my mom's computer illiteracy.

This happened several years ago when I was still quite young, about 12y/o. My grandpa would consistently have ""problems"" with his laptop and I, since I was the only one who would do it, had to walk all the way from the flat me and my parents were living in all the way to my grandparents house.

"A decade worth of e-mails all gone, by the simple non checking of a box. Life is fun, innit?","Hello all you glorious redditors here, I did post here a few years ago, but long since deleted my account and the tales with it - but alas I thought I would start posting stories of times gone by - now on to the story time!

**Background:**

At the age of 36 I live in my home town in Scotland where I was born and grew up, went to school and have my current job in retail for nearly four years now. This tale, amongst others that follow in this subreddit are from my job before this, where I worked in a callcentre for a national broadband, phone &amp; tv provider. I was in the business faults for broadband/phone line dealing with customers either on the phone or live chat over the 10 and a half years I was there before I was let go (that is a story for another time) - this story is from at some point whilst working there. It's worth keeping in mind that any names of customers, me and the company I did work for have been changed obviously to protect identities.

**Cast for this story:**

**Scotch:** Take a wild guess, hot stuff ;)

**EC:** E-Mail Customer

**CM:** Cool Manager (went through a couple whilst there, but at this point in time, CM was awesome)

**The Story:**

This story took place when Windows 7 was out for a few years and the customer decided to upgrade from their old XP machine to that, e-mails being one of the last thing he was looking to check - so this ir around 2011 ish.

*\*beep\**

**Scotch:** Welcome to &lt;telco's business support line&gt; my name is Scotch, who am I speaking to today and how can I help?

**EC:** Hi, my name is EC and all my e-mails have gone, I need your help! They are critical to my business you see.

**Scotch:** Sure, let me get some account details from you and lets see if we can get the problem fixed for you today EC.

*\*does account verification\**

**Scotch:** Thanks, ok, so the e-mails you lost, can you give me a bit more information about that? How do you normally check them? What setup do you have?

**EC:** I had a Windows XP machine, I used a program that came with it, I think it was Lookout Express? (Yes, he said it that way) and I used it in conjunction with \*your generic business e-mail address you guy's provide\* which I get my client orders from. I was using it for 10 years, it had all my e-mails in folders etc..

**Scotch:** Ahh, Outlook Express you mean, I know the program you are talking about, I can certainly help you with that, to see if we can recover or restore those e-mails for you! (Thinking it would be importing from a PST/EST file or looking for a backup if he had one).

**EC:** Well, I have actually invested in a new computer, upgraded from XP to Windows 7 and my IT guy got it all setup for me, getting Office installed with the paid for Lookout Express on it (read: Outlook 2007) and when he put in my e-mail info, none of my e-mails downloaded, though this is the first chance over the weekend I have had to call you about it and when I go on-the-line (he said that too) I can't see them through your portal (read: Outlook Web Access).

*Thinking this was a bit strange, I talked him through out remote access software (go to assist) and got to his screen which he was happy to do.*

**Scotch:** That's me now on your screen, I am going to look at the settings on Outlook Express to see what I can find out for you.

*I checked the settings and all appear fine, but I did notice that the option for ""Leave a copy on the server"" was not checked.*

**Scotch:** Do you see this option here?

**EC:** Yes I do, why are you showing me this?

**Scotch:** Just want to let you see something, if close this program and send you an e-mail from our test account, will you logon to the portal, with me still connected and we both can see this e-mail?

**EC:** *\*a bit hesitant but not grasping what was to lie ahead\** Ok...

*He opens it, I send him a test e-mail and it appears in the inbox*

**Scotch:** As you can see the e-mail is there, can I get you to close the portal for me and open the e-mail program to get the e-mail for me?

**EC:** Sure \*does so\* - right I can see your e-mail there, but I already know the mail account is working.

**Scotch:** Now if we logon to the portal again, you will see that the e-mail is gone...

*The customer logs on and see's the e-mail is gone.*

**Scotch:** If you remember EC that option I showed you earlier? If that was selected in Outlook Express, to leave a copy on line and you have ben downloading your e-mails like this for over 10 years, we at \*shitty ISP\* won't have a copy for you.

**EC:** WHAT?!?!?!? What are you trying to tell me? That all my previous e-mails are gone, I NO LONGER HAVE THEM?

**Scotch:** Well, EC, think of it this way...when someone sends you an item via the post, it gets sent to the central hub, then to the dispatch hub then gets delivered to you, e-mails work in the same idea, that when a person sends you an e-mail, it gets sent from their services, like the central hub, which then forwards to our services, the dispatch hub, then to your mail client. Unlike the post, that little box I showed you requests us to keep a copy of the e-mail on our services for you, without it checked then we won't.

**EC:** SO.I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING??? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

**Scotch:** Well EC, I am sorry to say but there is nothing that we at \*shitty ISP\* can do for you, as that option was setup like that, the majority of configurations like that are the way they are. You mentioned that you had an IT guy, correct? Did he configure any backups for you or do you still have the old hard disk drive that you used? Your IT maybe able to pull it off that?

**EC:** I no longer have the hard drive as he took it out and destroyed it so no one could gain access to it!!!!

**Scotch:** Well, EC - I have checked that box for you, so we will, moving forward, keep a copy of your e-mails, but for the previous 10 years worth of stuff, we can't do anything about that.

**EC:** GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOW!!!!!! I AM NOT HAVING THIS - I AM ONE OF YOUR CALUED CUSTOMERS AND YOU CANT TREAT ME LIKE THIS! I WILL LOOSE MY BUSINESS BECAUSE OF YOU!!!

**Scotch:** Please calm down EC, I understand your frustration there, I really do, however my manager will advise of the same, nothing we can do and to speak to your IT incase there is a backup of it.

**EC:** DID YOU NOT HEAR ME? MANAGER!

**Scotch:** Please hold whilst I get my manager for you.

*I disconnected from my remote access, went over to CM who was in the next bay from me, advised him quickly of the situation and he asked me to transfer the call to him and update the case notes.*

**Scotch:** Ok, EC, I have spoke to my CM, his name is &lt;Cool Manager&gt; and I am now transferring you over to him.

*I updated the notes, saved them, then went on to take a few more calls, around 45 minutes later I took my break and found CM.*

**Scotch:** So, CM, what was the outcome of that call?

**CM:** \*Laughs a little\* He is going to speak to his IT guy for failing to backup anything - but he really was clueless on the whole e-mail thing. Not that I can blame him, as IT is not for everyone, but he should have had least a backup of the stuff or his IT guy made him aware of it!

**Scotch:** I hope that he and the IT guy does find a resolution...

**TLDR: Where's my flask of Whisky and serving of haggis? I need to go on an epic journey with my moose to track down some e-mails a customer lost, as he did not back them up before he upgraded. If I am not back by sunrise tomorrow, give all my worldly belongings to Pinocchio when he comes a real boy...**",685,0,1,"A decade worth of e-mails all gone, by the simple non checking of a box.

I was in the business faults for broadband/phone line dealing with customers either on the phone or live chat over the 10 and a half years I was there before I was let go (that is a story for another time) - this story is from at some point whilst working there. It's worth keeping in mind that any names of customers, me and the company I did work for have been changed obviously to protect identities.

**Cast for this story:**

**Scotch:** Take a wild guess, hot stuff ;)

**EC:** E-Mail Customer

**CM:** Cool Manager (went through a couple whilst there, but at this point in time, CM was awesome)

**The Story:**

This story took place when Windows 7 was out for a few years and the customer decided to upgrade from their old XP machine to that, e-mails being one of the last thing he was looking to check - so this ir around 2011 ish.

*\*beep\**

**Scotch:** Welcome to &lt;telco's business support line&gt; my name is Scotch, who am I speaking to today and how can I help?

**EC:** Hi, my name is EC and all my e-mails have gone, I need your help! They are critical to my business you see.

**Scotch:** Sure, let me get some account details from you and lets see if we can get the problem fixed for you today EC.

*\*does account verification\**

**Scotch:** Thanks, ok, so the e-mails you lost, can you give me a bit more information about that? How do you normally check them? What setup do you have?

**EC:** I had a Windows XP machine, I used a program that came with it, I think it was Lookout Express? (Yes, he said it that way) and I used it in conjunction with \*your generic business e-mail address you guy's provide\* which I get my client orders from. I was using it for 10 years, it had all my e-mails in folders etc..

**Scotch:** Ahh, Outlook Express you mean, I know the program you are talking about, I can certainly help you with that, to see if we can recover or restore those e-mails for you! (Thinking it would be importing from a PST/EST file or looking for a backup if he had one).

**EC:** Well, I have actually invested in a new computer, upgraded from XP to Windows 7 and my IT guy got it all setup for me, getting Office installed with the paid for Lookout Express on it (read: Outlook 2007) and when he put in my e-mail info, none of my e-mails downloaded, though this is the first chance over the weekend I have had to call you about it and when I go on-the-line (he said that too) I can't see them through your portal (read: Outlook Web Access).

*Thinking this was a bit strange, I talked him through out remote access software (go to assist) and got to his screen which he was happy to do.*

**Scotch:** That's me now on your screen, I am going to look at the settings on Outlook Express to see what I can find out for you.

*I checked the settings and all appear fine, but I did notice that the option for ""Leave a copy on the server"" was not checked.*

**Scotch:** Do you see this option here?

**EC:** Yes I do, why are you showing me this?

**Scotch:** Just want to let you see something, if close this program and send you an e-mail from our test account, will you logon to the portal, with me still connected and we both can see this e-mail?

**EC:** *\*a bit hesitant but not grasping what was to lie ahead\** Ok...

*He opens it, I send him a test e-mail and it appears in the inbox*

**Scotch:** As you can see the e-mail is there, can I get you to close the portal for me and open the e-mail program to get the e-mail for me?

**EC:** Sure \*does so\* - right I can see your e-mail there, but I already know the mail account is working.

**Scotch:** Now if we logon to the portal again, you will see that the e-mail is gone...

*The customer logs on and see's the e-mail is gone.*

**Scotch:** If you remember EC that option I showed you earlier? If that was selected in Outlook Express, to leave a copy on line and you have ben downloading your e-mails like this for over 10 years, we at \*shitty ISP\* won't have a copy for you.

**EC:** WHAT?!?!?!? What are you trying to tell me? That all my previous e-mails are gone, I NO LONGER HAVE THEM?

**Scotch:** Well, EC, think of it this way...when someone sends you an item via the post, it gets sent to the central hub, then to the dispatch hub then gets delivered to you, e-mails work in the same idea, that when a person sends you an e-mail, it gets sent from their services, like the central hub, which then forwards to our services, the dispatch hub, then to your mail client. Unlike the post, that little box I showed you requests us to keep a copy of the e-mail on our services for you, without it checked then we won't.

**EC:** SO.I HAVE LOST EVERYTHING??? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

**Scotch:** Well EC, I am sorry to say but there is nothing that we at \*shitty ISP\* can do for you, as that option was setup like that, the majority of configurations like that are the way they are. You mentioned that you had an IT guy, correct? Did he configure any backups for you or do you still have the old hard disk drive that you used? Your IT maybe able to pull it off that?

**EC:** I no longer have the hard drive as he took it out and destroyed it so no one could gain access to it!!!!

**Scotch:** Well, EC - I have checked that box for you, so we will, moving forward, keep a copy of your e-mails, but for the previous 10 years worth of stuff, we can't do anything about that.

**EC:** GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOW!!!!!! I AM NOT HAVING THIS - I AM ONE OF YOUR CALUED CUSTOMERS AND YOU CANT TREAT ME LIKE THIS! I WILL LOOSE MY BUSINESS BECAUSE OF YOU!!!

**Scotch:** Please calm down EC, I understand your frustration there, I really do, however my manager will advise of the same, nothing we can do and to speak to your IT incase there is a backup of it.

**EC:** DID YOU NOT HEAR ME? MANAGER!

**Scotch:** Please hold whilst I get my manager for you.

*I disconnected from my remote access, went over to CM who was in the next bay from me, advised him quickly of the situation and he asked me to transfer the call to him and update the case notes.*

**Scotch:** Ok, EC, I have spoke to my CM, his name is &lt;Cool Manager&gt; and I am now transferring you over to him.

*I updated the notes, saved them, then went on to take a few more calls, around 45 minutes later I took my break and found CM.*

**Scotch:** So, CM, what was the outcome of that call?

**CM:** \*Laughs a little\* He is going to speak to his IT guy for failing to backup anything - but he really was clueless on the whole e-mail thing. Not that I can blame him, as IT is not for everyone, but he should have had least a backup of the stuff or his IT guy made him aware of it!

**Scotch:** I hope that he and the IT guy does find a resolution...

**TLDR: Where's my flask of Whisky and serving of haggis? I need to go on an epic journey with my moose to track down some e-mails a customer lost, as he did not back them up before he upgraded. If I am not back by sunrise tomorrow, give all my worldly belongings to Pinocchio when he comes a real boy...**"

I can fix your problem or I can talk to you,"This happened about 5 years back so the details are a bit fuzzy but another post brought it to light. 

Players: Me- T1 firewall monkey that usually deals with Vendors as well

Client Advocate (CA) - A member of our team who works directly with management of the client (usually to bypass our protocols to get a 'faster' resolution) 

Karen - Primary contact at the company, a Karen in all other respects.

Karen's company had recently merged with another company in the same industry (ah the crash of '08), both Companies were clients of ours. As such both companies were monitored in our system. At this time 100% of Karen's resources were hosted on-prem. I forget date but that day a ""router"" went down at one of the big ISPs that took out a good chunk of the country. We had dozens of our clients in the same area having issues connecting to the internet (down detector was showing red for most of the map). I got one of the P1 tickets generated and stated looking through the issue. I found quickly that it was due to the ISP. I bundled all tickets for this issue (including those for the second company) and started calling the ISP. I was placed in queue and was there for \~20 min before I get a Jabber message:

  
Co-worker1:I have Karen on the line, its about the outage  
Me: Let her know that I'm on the phone with ISP and I'll get her an update as soon as I have one from the ISP

\[repeat every 10 minutes, each time i tell them I'm still on hold with the ISP\]

Finally after about 90 minutes on hold a CA member comes in to physically talk to me (this is a big deal as most of the non-technical staff do not come near us on the Service Desk)

CA: Why are you not taking any of Karen's calls about this issue?   
Me: Because I've been on hold with the ISP for the past hour and a half. I can either hold my place and talk to the iSP and get her issue resolved or  I can take her call, hang up on the ISP, and then restart the clock as I get back in to queue.   
CA:Ok, I'll relay that to her.

After another hour I was able to lodge ticket 1234 with the ISP that is related to GIANT OUTAGE. It took the ISP another 12 hours to figure out what happened. Once it was completed I followed up with Karen who was pretty gruff that i wouldn't talk to her while I was on hold with the ISP.",1128,0,1,"I can fix your problem or I can talk to you This happened about 5 years back so the details are a bit fuzzy but another post brought it to light.

Blame and Redemption,"It's a cloudy Saturday morning. My toddler is eagerly cramming Cheerios in her mouth as I sip my morning coffee and browse Reddit. Suddenly, I hear the familiar ding of a work email on my phone and I make the mistake of opening it.

A senior technician at my company is working on a Server migration for a client and the old Host Server isn't showing up in our remote software and he needs it to fire up an old VM to look at some settings.

You see, this senior tech is very good at what he does, but is averse to learning anything new and requests assistance for anything that's outside of the scope of what he knows.

One of those things is the ins and outs of using one machine to control another without remoting directly to the other machine. Since 99% of the technical work I do is via remote connections, I've gotten pretty good at finding shortcuts to do what I need to get done.

As I'm contemplating whether I want to get involved or not, another ding chimes in. It's the boss. He correctly states that I had worked on updating our remote access software the previous night. However, he also incorrectly guesses that the Server is one of the victims of my upgrade and that's why it's offline.

Since I was getting the blame, I figured I may as well get involved. Especially because I distinctly recall that server being offline when I went to update that customer's machines the previous night. I double-check the connection history and confirm that it was offline before I started my work and I never sent the update command to that machine.

I jump on a VM on the new host and unsuccessfully attempt to connect to the old Host via RDP. Next, I pull up the services on the old Host and try restarting the remote access service - that didn't help. 

Finally, I find that I can control the VMs on the old host from the new. From there, I started the VM that the senior tech looking for and it comes to life in our remote access software.

Then, about a minute later, the old Host comes back online as well!

The issue - if you haven't already figured it out - the senior tech forgot to change DNS servers on the old Host's network adapter before shutting down both VMs that were providing DNS to it.

It really is always DNS. Oh, and yes, I did update the remote access client on both the VM and the old Host - no issues.

So, that's the story of how I fixed an issue that I was blamed for, even though I had nothing to do with it.",655,0,1,"Blame and Redemption It's a cloudy Saturday morning.

Just keep calling her every five minutes until she fixes it,"I work for a small theater and do many things for them, but mostly tech support.  Ever since I had kids, they let me work from home and the staff calls when they have trouble.

About 10 years ago we had this issue where most evenings just before the show started, the computers in the box office would get slower... and slower... until they froze and had to be rebooted.  It didn’t happen every night, but it always happened on the busiest ones.  I spent months scouring event logs, installing different AV software, stripping them down to nothing but the ticketing software, but nothing fixed it.  I knew it had to be that software itself, but that company’s support swore it wasn’t them, and had to be our machines.  

At the time, I also had an infant at home, and it never failed that as soon as I’d get him to sleep, the box office staff would call and the phone (a landline) would ring and wake him up.  One night, I had an extra difficult time getting him to sleep, and of course the phone rang.  I told them for the umpteenth time there was nothing I could do, just reboot.  Then I heard a worker in the background say, “just keep calling her every 5 minutes tonight until she fixes it.”  I was livid.  I hung up and figured out how to block their number.  After that, I started blocking it every evening at 5pm until the next morning.  Eventually we started using another company’s software and never had that issue again.",1520,0,1,"Just keep calling her every five minutes until she fixes it I work for a small theater and do many things for them, but mostly tech support.

Disaster Averted...,"This happened this week.

In the school district I work for we bring in all staff laptops during the summer break to maintain and update them so the staff have basically a clean install to start the new year with. Its a pain but it prevents a lot of problems.

So this week I get an email from the school nurse. She wants to know where her laptop is. I look around and its nowhere to be found. I provide laptops for all of my districts nurses as they are run from a central location that I also am in charge of. And there are a lot of them. Its a big district. 

Most of the nurses got new laptops last year so losing one is a big deal. I know they are encrypted so I'm not concerned with losing data, but because of distance learning I have absolutely no spare laptops younger than the first graders at this particular school.

So searched all of my sites trying to find this machine to no avail. I had come to the conclusion that I had mixed her machine up with one that was to go to a new hire. I asked for the asset tag number so I could figure out who was going to have to give up their laptop for an older version.

Amazingly she had recorded the asset number and gave it to me. 

Now at this point I'm confused. The number is so low it could not possibly be correct. If this were a valid number it would mean that her laptop would be so old if it were a child it would have aged out of this elementary school and would be half way through middle school.

So I said ""What the f\*\*\*"" and went through every machine on campus. And there I found it. Like the Holy Grail. A 13 year old laptop on the top of my e-waste pile. HER laptop. 

It was originally licensed for XP but was running Windows 7. She just didn't want to give it up because she had gotten used to it.

I recovered her files and gave her a ""new"" machine that was at least age appropriate for an elementary school.",728,0,1,"Disaster Averted... This happened this week.

It's all in the monitors,"Little bit of a short one, but I feel this took some time off my life.

I had a support ticket for moving some computers across a campus from one building into another, which is no big deal. I just needed to unplug everything, round them up in a box, and carry them to their new home and get everything hooked back up. Sweet and simple and easy. For one of the people moving, where they were moving to had better monitors that were compatible with what she already had and didn’t need any new cables. Upon this, I decided to explain it to her and see if she would like having the new and better monitors.

“But my old screens have my desktop and everything saved on them.”

What?

“You know, like all my icons, my wallpaper, my files, everything. They are all saved on those screens.”

Now, her computer was not an all-in-one. It was a mini-PC. So I explained to her that the small black box sitting behind her monitors was her computer and all of her files and settings were saved there, so if she wanted new monitors, everything would still be there.

“No the icons were on my screens, so they are saved to my screens.”

Needless to say, I was dumbfounded and at a loss for what to say to this lady. I explained to her once again that ultimately, her monitors didn't matter since everything she needed was inside of this magical box. She still refused to accept this, stating that it didn't make sense because everyone has their own monitors and their own set up, so everything must have been on the monitors.

Her stubbornness won, however, so I ended up taking the good monitors off the stand, and installed her old ones. While she may have won the battle, someone else won the war and got some nice monitors to replace their set up.",948,0,1,"It's all in the monitors Little bit of a short one, but I feel this took some time off my life.

Never let managers near the keyboard,"Ok, going back into ancient history, somewhere around 1989...   

(Sorry, the background takes a little while)

I used to administer several OS/2 servers for departments at a university.   
One day, we had a call that printing had stopped working for one department.   
The server was an IBM PS/2 desktop with an HP clone laser printer hooked up to the parallel port (LPT1:).  

For whatever reason, the department decided that C:\ on the server should be shared with read/write access to all users. Yes, there was a directory structure they stored their files in, but generally, things were ok.   

Until the day a user brought in some shareware software they “needed” to use.
After creating whatever report they were working on, they went to print.
Being a DOS pc, they had to configure their printer. Knowing the printer was on LPT1: on the server, they figured that’s what they needed to set but managed to do that as a “print to file” thing.

DOS being DOS and brain-dead (and this being v1.2 of OS/2), the server dutifully created the file.   
Printing ceased.   

I spent an hour trying to remove the d*mn file without luck.   

(Enter the rogue manager).  

It was at that point (as I was talking to the department boss) my manager took the keyboard and said “I know!” and proceeded to issue the command “DEL *.*” on the root of the C: drive, then reboot!   

The word “oops” was said, followed by “can you fix that?”   

For the uninitiated, an OS/2 install was done from floppy disk. All 20 of them. Then the 10 “Corrective Service” disks",1562,0,1,"Never let managers near the keyboard Ok, going back into ancient history, somewhere around 1989...

Video cards can have those?,"Hello, enemies. Short time poster, first time lurker.

I was asked to test a video card that had fried a machine $dayjob tried to use at a convention to show off their work. So I plugged it in, turned on the machine... Almost nothing. The power came on, the screen lit up, but nothing else happened. Did some fiddling, nothing changed. Unplugged, switched back to the old card... No change. Swap to integrated graphics, no change. fsck.ext4 /home/niveusluna

Told the CTO, he was understanding. Told our hardware guy, he said, ""And you plugged in the extra power cables?""

I paused. ""Video cards can have power cables?""

We both went to check the video card in question. Sure enough, it had a couple cables coming off the end that I hadn't seen. Because they weren't plugged in, the necessary power had been routed through the motherboard. The motherboard and its components weren't rated for that kind of current, which was why the video card had those cables to start with.

Updated the CTO on what happened and asked whether he was willing to potentially sacrifice a third machine to find out whether the initial frying (at the convention) was due to a bad card or user error.

I remained employed with that company. Yes, it was an expensive lesson, but I will not make that mistake again.

how hard can remote support be? the answer: very hard,"so we're moving users over to office365 from office2010. this involves moving users over to a new remote desktop farm. users remote on using an I.E link on their desktop. they sign in, then click on an icon. with the new farm, they have a second icon. relatively simple.

most users are now migrated, but some are still logging onto the old farm. i contact these users and ask them to start using the new farm by clicking on the second icon. one user says she doesn't have the icon (which i know is untrue as i've tested all of the users) but i give her the benefit of the doubt. and so starts the email exchange.

"We've reached an agreement that before I submit any more testing tickets with the title ""test ticket"" I will give them a heads up that the ticket I'm submitting is a test ticket.","**Flavor-Text-You-Can-Totally-Skip**

Our dept. has had its own project in our $TicketSystem for years. This project also connects to $AlertSystem so that on-call engineers get notified of after-hours tickets. Both of these things long predate the creation of a department we'll call $ProblemMonitoring.

Recently, in order to ~~increase bureaucracy,~~ *improve efficiency,* various company-wide automated tasks have been added between $TicketSystem projects and $ProblemMonitoring. This was to ensure that they knew about and could monitor *all* issues so that ~~if we failed to follow procedure~~ *needed any assistance*, they could jump in. Notably, this was done without our input or feedback.

Today, I needed to test the $TicketSystem-$AlertSystem integration in our project as we were having a few cases of missed notifications. This requires submitting a test ticket--something that's moderately routine.

----

&gt; **$ProblemMonitoring**: That alert that you sent off fired off an incident for us as well.

&gt; **$Me**: Ok *[This feels like a* ***you*** *problem]*

&gt; **$ProblemMonitoring**: What was that for?

&gt; **$Me**: The ""testing network alerts"" ticket?

&gt; **$ProblemMonitoring**: What were you testing... Are they always going to come in as critical? the projects directly tie together

&gt; **$Me**: Testing the alert system for critical issues

&gt; **$ProblemMonitoring**: Ok. Specifically $AlertSystem? What alert system, we can't have incidents firing off left and right.

*Some battles just aren't worth fighting...*",1435,0,1,"We've reached an agreement that before I submit any more testing tickets with the title ""test ticket"" I will give them a heads up that the ticket I'm submitting is a test ticket. **Flavor-Text-You-Can-Totally-Skip**

Our dept. has had its own project in our $TicketSystem for years. This project also connects to $AlertSystem so that on-call engineers get notified of after-hours tickets. Both of these things long predate the creation of a department we'll call $ProblemMonitoring.

Recently, in order to ~~increase bureaucracy,~~ *improve efficiency,* various company-wide automated tasks have been added between $TicketSystem projects and $ProblemMonitoring. This was to ensure that they knew about and could monitor *all* issues so that ~~if we failed to follow procedure~~ *needed any assistance*, they could jump in. Notably, this was done without our input or feedback.

Today, I needed to test the $TicketSystem-$AlertSystem integration in our project as we were having a few cases of missed notifications. This requires submitting a test ticket--something that's moderately routine.

Reboot your computers!," I had this comment on r/iiiiiiitttttttttttt and it was suggested I post it here.

I work as Tier 2 Desktop Support and I had two users that kept getting locked out Monday. The service desk called me as well as our AD guy for help. I'd unlock their AD account but within 5 minutes they'd be locked out again.

For one of the user's who was on a laptop, I went so far as to clear everything from Credential Manager and all of his browsers, but within a few minutes of me unlocking his account he'd be locked out again. The second user was on Citrix, so this shouldn't have been an issue since we don't allow the storing of passwords, but it was the same for them.

So after being thorouly confused on why he keeps getting locked out we turned to our AD guy for some help. He was able to determine they were getting locked out from the same machine which was locked in a secure room. The odd thing was the Citrix user hasn't been on that team for a year so shouldn't even have access to the machine.

I located the machine easily enough and turned it off. Issue immediately resolved. Okay, so now it's time to see why this was going on.

I take it down to staging and boot it back up which takes forever. It's one of our older HP EliteDesks with a spiny drive which we've been phasing out. I log in and open Start to check some things out.

Wait, something's wrong. Why does the start menu look like this? Oh my gosh, it's still running 1511! We've been on 1803 for over a year and have even since moved on to 1903. Well, it's old and a few updates behind so my solution is just going to be to kill it and replace it with one of the hundreds of Optiplex 3070s we have sitting in a room that the board decided to purchase (without consulting IT) due to COVID-19 (don't ask).

Just for fun I check the logs. Last time powered on was August 19th, not too bad. Wait, does that say 2019? How does a Windows PC not crash in over a year? Why has no one at least restarted this thing when SCCM tells the user to? Well, that explained just about... everything.

Updates were behind because it hasn't been rebooted in so long and users were being locked out because it was wakened from sleep and they were still logged in with AD passwords that were way expired.

Cleaning up the system folder,"This was back in the mid 2000s when I was working as a tech/sales engineer for mainly ad agencies, printers and so on. Creative and nice people and generally great coffee but usually not especially tech-savvy.

One day I got a call from a panicked young lady working for one of our customers.

She: My Mac does not start up anymore!

Me: Me: OK. did you do anything out of the ordinary while working?

She: Nothing!  (Oh, if I got a euro for each time I hear that one....) 

Me: Is there any error message shown?  

She: Nothing! 

At that point, I just reached for my bootable firewire disk and started driving to that place. 

One hour later I got there, we went right to the computer and I started it up. Sure enough: It showed the Mac equivalent of a ""no system or disk error"". I opened the case, checked the cables (they might have come loose after all) and switched it back on again. Same error.

Well, that could mean, that the hard drive was likely shot, but as it didn't sound weird, I thought there might be a good chance for recovering at least some of the data.

Enter the firewire disk for booting up the mess and: The disk was detected flawlessly. All data reachable, no err ----wait. what's that?

Me: that's strange. somehow the systems folder (like the Windows folder on PCs) is gone. Are you sure you did nothing to the system?

She: nothing! well.. except.. I cleaned up the files a bit and there was this folder with a lot of files I didn't know, so I deleted them.

Me: like..20.000 files?

She: Maaaaybeee.

So: She deleted the Operating system from her computer and I had to install everything again, look for the CDs (that was way before the days of cloud downloads), register them, etc. 

A day and a half later she had a newly installed and updated OSX plus all the applications installed, configured and an invoice for about 1800€. The company paid it in full and appearently considered it a learning experience for her, as she kept worked for that company for a few years after that.

The time we crashed a VAX by Osmosis,"I’ll start by saying anyone has been around as long as I have will recognize this is an old story because the VAX was one of the big mainframe computers, not one that took an entire room, but a good portion of one. Relevant to the story is the fact that the software for these computers was put on reel to reel tapes that were shipped to the customers.

I worked for a company that manufactured software for these computers and it was quite easy for a bug in the software to cause the computers to crash, Which leads to the phone call.  

“Your software crashed our system!”  Is how the caller announced himself, so immediately I do the apologetic that’s so awful and I’m so sorry etc. etc. etc.
Then “Could you tell me where you loaded the software?”

These computers, they were fussy critters, and you had to put the software in the right location internally or that alone could cause the system to crash and we all know how customers like to ignore instructions that they think are unimportant. Like the ones that say, “please follow the installation instructions exactly as written or else your system may crash.”

The customer answers, “I walked into the computer room and set it on top of the computer and the whole system went down.”

“ I beg your pardon?”

“I sent the tape reel on top of the computer and it crashed!  You crashed my VAX!”

“Could I have you hold just a moment please, sir?”

Then I muted my headset and started laughing. Guy next to me asked me what the heck, so I looked up and said, “apparently we crashed this guy’s computer by osmosis.”

“How????”

“We apparently are that powerful. Merely touching our software to the outside of the system caused the entire system to die.”

Once I had stopped laughing, I returned to the customer and gave him instructions on how to send us his crash dump (I don’t know if it’s still called that, it’s just a log of what was happening when the system went down). 

Spoiler alert: Our software was not the cause of the problem. It remains my favorite tech-support call ever though.

Never give up,"First time poster, on a mobile, etc. TLDR at the bottom.

So, I’m not a traditional tech support person, just the slightly tech savvy husband of a (tech savvy in her own way) primary school teacher at a small village school somewhere in the UK. The school has recently come out of special measures but is still a work in progress. As with all schools, funding is tight. Do they fix a leaky roof or upgrade IT? You guessed right, IT is a distant second.

When Lockdown can back in March, there were some intense brainstorming sessions by the school staff on how to engage with pupils, particularly those from a socially disadvantaged demographic who were at most risk of being left behind if left to their own devices. One of the staff had found an online platform (ClassDojo) which was really well received by pupils and parents alike. Unfortunately you need to be able to get online to use it. 

My wife mentioned that it was annoying they couldn’t lend out some school iPads as one of the SEN kids has managed to activation lock them and nobody knew the login details due to changes in IT suppliers when converting from a local authority run school to an Academy school.  The head teacher was resigned to the fact that these were bricked and beyond saving, as their current IT support had already tried to unlock them. Seeing as I was furloughed at the time I took it as a challenge to get them back online.

First port of call was the former IT support company where luck would have it, the guy who set them up in the first place (we’re talking original iPad mini, so 5-6 years ago) answered the phone. He tried to setup the recovery email address again, but unfortunately nothing came through.

We spoke to Apple Education (in the US) who were really helpful saying that if we could get an invoice then they could be reset. It was such a long time ago though, who would have the record? Luck would have it, the Local Authority has a digitised invoicing system, so were able to pull up the scans and email them over. Result! The stars are aligning...

Except there were no serial numbers on the invoices. I mean seriously, why would a supplier write X iPads and not list the serial numbers too?! A call to the supplier resulted in a cry of anguish and frustration as they’d migrated systems a few years back and lost some data including the invoices in question...!

Another call to Apple - explained where we were, was there anything that could be done? It turns out that as long as the invoice has the serial numbers written on - even by hand (!!!!!) then they could reset the iPads. Great! I wrote on the serials and submitted to Apple to then be rejected as they don’t “match”. I then do some more research and find that you can ID the date of manufacture from the serial, so needed to make sure the dates matched (there were two invoices a year or so apart). Did this, resubmitted and got them unlocked! 15 iPads back from the dead!

First thing I did after fist pumping in satisfaction was to ring the current IT supplier to get the MDM profile sent over so the iPads could be locked down to prevent this happening in the future. After setting up, they were able to be issued out to the children in need, to then not be used for the entire summer judging by their reported lack of interaction with ClassDoJo 🤦‍♂️

Did this, resubmitted and got them unlocked! 15 iPads back from the dead!

First thing I did after fist pumping in satisfaction was to ring the current IT supplier to get the MDM profile sent over so the iPads could be locked down to prevent this happening in the future. After setting up, they were able to be issued out to the children in need, to then not be used for the entire summer judging by their reported lack of interaction with ClassDoJo 🤦‍♂️

TL;DR: School has disabled iPads, I do some detective work and get them unlocked."
You're lucky I've worked here for 5 years,"I’m first line support for an application that doctors use to keep records on their patients as well as manage the practice. It’s called an EMR or Electronic Medical Record.

Background: We have these things called Observation Terms Kits. They're released every month. As new terms were added around COVID, they were released weekly. In simple terms, they're an industry standard list of codes for illnesses, injuries, etc. So, for instance, a pregnancy test has one obs term, another for patients that are smokers, etc. The new kits have new codes along with the old. So, it's like getting a new dictionary every month with new words along with the old.

Normally, these codes don't ever change. Three years ago, one changed. Specifically the code for a mammogram. 

In a patient's chart is something called a flowsheet. It's basically a spreadsheet with these terms on the left side and the date in columns along the top. Instead of looking through a bunch of documents, a doctor can see on the flowsheet that the patient's temperature was 98.1° on 7/24 and then 98.4° on 8/16 and so on.

The case:

The customer enters a case through the customer portal and explains their issue so poorly that I think they’re talking about billing codes that aren’t importing into the EMR correctly from a third party. They make it sound like all codes are having a problem. Since this sounds more like an issue in the billing section of our software, I ask one of our billing techs to join a call with me and the customer. The customer invites someone from the third party. 

The meeting starts and there’s a bunch of trouble getting everyone on their side into the conference call. Then they spend a bunch of time explaining the issue, again confusedly. We finally get to the actual issue. Lab results for a mammogram aren’t importing into the flowsheet as expected. So, I ask to see an example and they show me one of the patients. Naturally, the customer insists that nothing has changed and this issue started all of a sudden. The tech from the third party insists that nothing has changed on their end.

I can’t explain to them why this changed all of a sudden. Why this one code is having a problem if what they’re telling me is true, that nothing has changed. The fact that this is a mammogram starts nagging at me. 

In the interface, there’s a file that translates the third party’s code (lab companies will often use their own names/numbers for tests) to our codes. I ask that we change the code on our side to the new code from 3 years ago (though I don’t point out just how old this change is because “nothing has changed”) but they insist that I not change the code. Even just to test. They’d had some server issues the previous week and are extremely nervous about changing anything now that everything but this is now working.

If they were wrong and a new copy of the observation terms kit had been imported, the value in the database for a mammogram would have been updated. But we don’t have access to the database. Nobody on the call has it. So, my only option is to change the translation file, test, and revert back if it doesn’t fix the issue.

As I’m pleading to change the file and test, some of the people on the call have to leave and we end the call agreeing to meet again. The time will be worked out via email.

A week goes by and I get no response from the customer. I say that I’ll be closing the case due to no reply from the customer and explain what I intended to do. They finally update me and I explain what needs to be done again. The customer finally schedules a meeting for two weeks from the current date. There’s a vacation that the customer is going on and the issue, apparently, can wait.

We finally meet yesterday. I tell them exactly what I’m going to change and that we can change it back, with no harm done to anything, if it doesn’t work for a test patient. They finally relent. I change the translation file. Have the third party send a mammogram result for a test patient. It works as expected. The actual fix and test takes 5 minutes.

TFTS Finally something to post,"over the years ive commented a bit but never posted my own story. mostly because i'd rather not relive my horror stories and sometimes because I am not sure if i can or should share a story.

Today is different...because today i got to be someone's hero, and we all deserve to be told that our dedication saved the day once in a while. 

I spent my entire morning on a call with a customer half way around the world. But this was one of those issues that had already drug on too long and been touched by too many people for it to be a simple matter. And looking at the message thread that came before where i joined i see its got LOTS of visibility....people with Titles (with big letters and junk) on both sides active in the thread and none of them seem especially happy... Time to jump on a grenade!

Fast forward uh....6 HOURS? good lord....and the issue still wasn't really entirely fixed BUT we got most of it up and running and learned some odd stuff along the way. And as far as a software vendor support dude is concerned i went way beyond what i probably needed to - but this is MY CUSTOMER and he was desperate (Titles on both sides remember) i cannot just leave him twisting in the wind. By the end he was telling me steadily how much he appreciated my effort, and i appreciate the appreciation right back!

All that to say, yall in TFTS work hard and when you are working your hardest and pulling off honest digital miracles, nobody even knew you were doing anything.

Sometimes my hubby farms me out for tech support,"Being the tech go-to guy, I usually get called for tech support for my hubby (whom I have wrote about before) and my sister's family.

My hubby does have this annoying habit on occasion of volunteering my tech skills to our friends.  This happened over the weekend.  I had just got back home from the hospital, I thought I was having cardiac issues (I had a mild heart attack on July 1st) but it turned out to be acid reflux (which can manifest itself as a heart attack.) Note: it happened at my job on Saturday.

Well, after I got home from the hospital, the hubby told me that our friend (who we will call L) was having sound issues with with his desktop computer after he had moved it across the street to his new house.  The hubby told him that we would stop by after I got done with work.

So today rolled around, and after we went to the pharmacy to pick up my acid reflux meds and stopped at the supermarket for ingredients for dinner (pasta carbonara, which I love) we headed to L's house.

L is a sweet guy, and he uses his computer to compose music, so obviously he needs speakers for playback. So I pull up his desktop on the screen, and check the audio settings.  It said that it was using digital output for the speakers (a nice 2.1 setup,) and when I looked at them, I knew for a fact that the speakers use an analog output.  (My computer is the same way, since I also have 2.1 speakers.) So I get down to the tower and check the cabling, and sure enough, the speaker jack was plugged into the wrong output.  I corrected it, and then pulled up his music composition program and loaded one of his compositions.  Sure enough, music started pouring out of the speakers.

I told L what happened, and he said ""Well, my brother hooked my computer back up for me.""

I told him, ""He put the jack in the wrong damn hole.""

L: ""Oops. I knew you could figure it out."" (Note, I had provided tech support for him before when he was trying to transfer photos from his camera to his computer, and all he had to do was turn the camera on.)

So when I got back in the car (the hubby had to stay there because our Great Dane was in the back seat,) the hubby asked what was wrong.  I told him ""The jack was in the wrong hole.""  My hubby with his dirty mind started snickering when I said that.

Nothing earth shattering, just another instance of being unofficial tech support.

"Somehow I don't think a ""Caution: Exploding Hard Drives"" sign will really solve this one","Back when a disturbingly large amount of people liked IE and even used it by choice, I was working for a company that manufactured large metal things.

We had been hard at work at a major IT infrastructure upgrade.  It had all the usual trappings of such things: gripes from the users that dislike change and would just like DOS back thankyouverymuch, gripes about the color of the new icons, gripes about everything.  The IT team had been working hard at this thankless job for a long while but it was getting to us all.

Part of the project was replacing hundreds of PCs with newer models.  This was resulting in enough hard drives to destroy that our previous destruction method was overwhelmed.  So we had to find some other options.  We didn't have the time or space to do something like DBAN on hundreds of PCs, so we needed something better, and fast.

I had recently been promoted to my first managerial position, and I applied my ""employee empowerment"" lesson and let my tech team  brainstorm about how to destroy all the data on those hard drives.  I had expected ideas about e-waste recyclers, etc.  But no.  EVERY idea involved using large, dangerous machinery out in the manufacturing area.  Some of them carried a risk of death, and my team was most excited about those.

""Would an hour in {EXTREMELY HOT INDUSTRIAL OVEN} destroy the data?""

""What if we dropped them into {VAT OF DANGEROUS CHEMICAL}?""  ""Or better, what if we THREW them into {VAT} and watched {CHEMICAL} splash all over the place?""  Laughter from the team.  Grimace from me.

""Maybe we could use some spare wire and build ourselves an eeeeeenormous electromagnet and wipe them that way!"" 

""How about the acetylene torch?""

""Maybe throw them at {LARGE SPINNING EQUIPMENT} and watch them get chopped to bits?""  ""Nah, the bits would fly all over the place.""  ""EVEN BETTER!  We could SWEEP UP our hard drives when we're done!""

""How about bats like in Office Space?""  ""No, AXES would be better!""

""What about the welders?  Surely they could pulverise them somehow?""  ""No, the ROBOTIC welders!  We'll program them to destroy the drives!""  ""Or maybe the laser cutters?""

""Could we put them in a big pile, douse them with gas, and just light them all on fire?""

You can see this was going downhill (or uphill, depending on your perspective) fast.  Perhaps they were also enjoying making me squirm, particularly when they started with the pseudo-realistic ideas involving chainsaws.

One of the PFYs (""pimply-faced youths"", the youngest members of the team) ran off to go talk to his buddy on the manufacturing floor.  This buddy was a jovial, burly, cynical, tattooed, leather-wearing Harley rider who would LOVE to use expensive corporate equipment to smash other expensive corporate equipment to bits.  Probably even more than the techs that had been listening to upgrade whines for 6 months.  I liked the guy and the PFY, but I feared that the combination of adventure-seeking tech and danger-seeking equipment operator would get out of hand -- and if we weren't careful, someone might lose theirs.

Eventually when the techs ran out of steam with the ideas, I laid down three ground rules:

1) Nobody gets hurt

2) Data must actually be destroyed

3) Must be fast

Before too long, PFY returned with an ENORMOUS smile on his face, carrying two hard drives with large holes in the middle.  ""We tried it on the {ridiculously large} drill press, and it cut through them like putty!""  ""What's this white liquid on them?""  ""Oh that's the cooling liquid the drill automatically sprays on the things being drilled to keep from overheating.""

PFY and the rest of my team excitedly scampered off to the drill press to drill more holes in more drives.  I went over and watched a few with, yes, a smile on my face also.

But it all came crashing down when they tried the [press brake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_brake).  Our press brake was used to basically fold massive sheets of steel.  I'm not talking thin sheets like tin or something.  This was thick, hard steel, and it folded it like paper.  My techs (or perhaps their equally-entertained friends in the shop) had the idea of putting hard drives in the press brake, and bending them beyond recognition.

Unfortunately it transpired that hard drives in a press brake don't bend.  Or, at least they don't ONLY bend.  They also... explode.  Bits of hard drive flew out of the machine and went an ~~exciting~~ dangerous distance.

I wasn't there to witness, but my team was ecstatic about this effect.  ~~Unfortunately~~ Fortunately it was witnessed by a certain tight-sphinctered person with a clipboard and a reflective vest (I've [written about him before](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/a0k8cb/better_to_be_a_wuss_than_stand_in_a_puddle_of/)).  Thus ended the festivities.  Some on my team begged to keep doing it, saying ""it'll be fine if we just lay the drives down flat"" and ""we'll do it after-hours and even put up a safety sign!""  I said, ""Somehow I don't think a 'Caution: Exploding Hard Drives' sign will really solve this one.""

Since everyone involved had actually followed the company safety policy by wearing eye protection and so forth, my team got away with a verbal reprimand; same with the equipment operators.  But I had to officially forbid the team from using corporate equipment to pulverize magnetic-based non-volatile storage devices.

However, managers were only there during business hours, but the manufacturing area ran 24/7 with multiple shifts.  Some of my team, including PFY, worked an earlyish shift to help out with early-morning IT issues.  I couldn't help but notice that the stack of drives with holes in them was larger each morning when I walked in, and a poorly-concealed grin on PFY's face as he said ""good morning"" each day.

I grinned back and kept on walking to my desk.

Better not to ask.

Hey can you come here to put a charger in the middle of the night?,"So this story happend like 4 years ago and my father is OP, sorry for my grammar english isn't my first language and yada yada yada

Some informationMy father works as an informatic in a hospital and he sometime does this ""reachable"" (thanks to the comments, now i know it's ""on call) thing for some days which tbh I don't know a flip about but basically everyone in the hospital can call him at every, yes EVERY hour of the day if he as a problem with a pc (even if it doesn't start). This is counted as overtime and he gets paid more and if he do this for a week he gets a day home when he wants so totally worth it (he has like 60 days in account by now so if he wants a two months break he can take it and get paid). Ok i talked way too much, now onto the story

Ok it was 3 A.M. and my mom and dad are sleeping as well as i am in my room, right next to theirs. We all suddently wake, there's a loud noise, it was my father's phone ringing: the hospital. It pisses of but it happens less than once a month, no one calls at night, so he answers, now i'll write the conversation my dad told me.

D= dad
IN= idiot nurse


D: hello?

IN: hello is this *surname*?

D: yes, what seems to be the issue?

IN, i am at the end of my night shift and i need to write some report down before i go home but my the office pc doesn't start!

D: ok it had problems in the past days? The nurse before you said something about it don't working well?

IN: No anything! What do i do!?!? I need to sleeeeep!!

D: ok ok calm. What does the monitor say? 

IN: No signal. What does it mean (english isn't first language here so she didn't know)

D: ok *proceeds to tell her what no signal stands for and tries to solve the problem*

This goes on for about 15 mins and the pc won't start

Suddently my dad has a realization.

D: wait look under the desk

IN: ok what now?

D: is the charger in the power point?

IN: No? Should it?

D: *huff* Yes, or else the pc has no electricity to work

IN: Ewww but it's gross! There's too much dust! Can't you come here and put it in for me?

D: Are you kidding me? I am here to tell you what to do, not to do it, you are a damn nurse you should have some gloves! If you're so picky use them! BYE!
*Hangs up*

My dad was fuming and he was super tired and went back to sleep. The they after he told us the story and we all laughet about it.

That woman has some powers my dad never gets angry even with my EM (entitled mother) he stays calm (i should post about her on other subreddits) but this nurse was so dumb he couldn't do it anymore. Happy you reached the end! Have a good day!

Edit: grammar. Also for everyone asking the hospital is 1 hour of car from my house so the nurse wanted my dad to get in the car in the middle of the night, drive an hour put a damn charger in and come back hom. Some people",916,0,1,"Hey can you come here to put a charger in the middle of the night? So this story happend like 4 years ago and my father is OP, sorry for my grammar english isn't my first language and yada yada yada

Some informationMy father works as an informatic in a hospital and he sometime does this ""reachable"" (thanks to the comments, now i know it's ""on call) thing for some days which tbh I don't know a flip about but basically everyone in the hospital can call him at every, yes EVERY hour of the day if he as a problem with a pc (even if it doesn't start). This is counted as overtime and he gets paid more and if he do this for a week he gets a day home when he wants so totally worth it (he has like 60 days in account by now so if he wants a two months break he can take it and get paid). Ok i talked way too much, now onto the story

Ok it was 3 A.M. and my mom and dad are sleeping as well as i am in my room, right next to theirs. We all suddently wake, there's a loud noise, it was my father's phone ringing: the hospital. It pisses of but it happens less than once a month, no one calls at night, so he answers, now i'll write the conversation my dad told me.

D= dad
IN= idiot nurse


D: hello?

IN: hello is this *surname*?

"A whole production site down, for a simple error","I work IT support for an optician based in Paris, France. They have stores all over France and in a few other countries. They also have a subsidiary with a production site some distance away, still in Paris. This site is comprised of two buildings - relevant later.

August is an ""off-month"" for the whole company. Most activities go down, more than half the personnel is on vacation. Including the entire personnel of one building in the distant site, meaning that building is closed off.

Of course, that's when the troubles begin. We get a warning that the internet went down on the production site. Worse, the network materiel that we need to check is in the closed-off building. And, of course, the most mobile tech of the team is yours truly, because I'm on a bicycle, everybody else depends on public transportation. Going there takes me 25-30 minutes, by 38-40°C (Approx 100-104 F). Also I wear dark trousers because of the dress code.

I grab the keys of the closed-off building, only to find that it does open the metal curtain but not the main door. After searching a bit, the only option is to go back to the main site to find the other key. Another 25 minutes in scorching heat.

Turns out the guy who handed me the key thought he had four identical keys. Wrong, he had two sets of two different keys, and only gave me one. I gulp down a half liter of water and stash another in my bag - courtesy of the company. Back to the production site I go. Again, 25 minutes of rather intense pedaling under the merciless sun of early August.

Of course, opening the main door and the metal curtain did NOT end my troubles. The alarm was on, and the guy who administrated the alarm in most situations could not - it can be remotely administrated, but only when the internet works, which, of course, is the one thing that had gone down. He finally gives me a code that will get me in. Of course the damn thing is super-sensitive and if you take five more seconds than needed you get your ears blasted. Ah, well. It only lasted less than a second.

Finally able to get to work, I do the usual IT check ups. Power everything down, wait a bit, power it back up, so on. Nothing budges. I do note that the modem is stuck at a step in its power up sequence. I take note of everything, then back to the main site. Once there, I tasked one of my colleagues with contacting the internet service provider to see what was wrong, since that error code was for them. I, for my part, was done with my day and quite happy to be rid of that garbage for the day.

I'd spent my whole afternoon either on my bicycle or waiting for stuff to happen, with little AC anywhere. A couple hours after I got home, my colleague told me he'd found the crux of the matter :

The contract with the ISP had not been renewed, and of course the service had been cut. Even better : the service would take up to a week to be back up. It was a vital part of the still active production team's work, and it was completely inoperable.

Reference to old school tech solution goes over head of younger network tech,"So this is my first ever post on Reddit. Been reading here for quite a while, but finally have an experience worth sharing.

So I work for a rather large organization in network operations. I am fairly new to the network side of things, but have almost 20 years IT experience.

I was at my desk making notes on some of the network tickets in my queue when I receive a call from one of our buildings saying they had no network connectivity in the whole building. I am unable to ping or SSH the switch. Check the distribution router. It showed the connection was down.

I headed out to the building and checked the switch. Logged in. Tried a few things (restart the connection to the distro, restart the whole switch, reseated the fiber, reseated the GBIC). None of that solved the connection problem. 

Sent a text to the boss to check what else I was missing and to check the fiber path. She texted back that sometimes the GBIC are like a troublesome Nintendo cartridge and that she would check the path. The younger guy (mid 20s) that I had with me looked at me confused and said he didn't understand what she meant by the Nintendo cartridge reference. I explained. We went to the distro router, I pulled the GBIC on the fiber that went to that building blew on it. Reseated it and the fiber and the glorious connection light came on for that interface. Logged into the distro and it showed the connection was up. Checked with the users at the building and they were all good.

"""It's where you would put the hat!""","Early 2000s, call center for  [Redacted] wireless, billing and support, I have LOTS of stories, but here's one of my favourites:

Had a customer call in angry right away (shocking I know) here's how the call went, I am paraphrasing a bit, as this was almost two decades ago:

Customer: MY PHONE IS BROKEN

Support(Me): Ok, what exactly is broken with it?

Customer: What do you mean!? It's broken, are you stupid or something!?

Me: Well, broken can mean a lot of things, can you please explain what YOU mean by broken?

Customer: The screen is dead! It doesn't even make a sound when I try to call people!

Me: Oh, see? This is why I ask what YOU mean by broken....A sound!? Like a dial tone? Cell phones don't have a dial-tone like home phones. Is it on? Is it charged?

Customer: I don't know what that means

Me: You've plugged it in?

Customer: I just got it, and the screen doesn't even work! AND I can't call anyone! This thing is useless!

Me: Okay, so it might not be charged, have you tried the power button?

Customer: I don't know what you mean, what power button!?

Me: Well, with cell phones, you need to turn them on, and they have batteries, so after a while the battery needs to be charged again.

Customer: So, what do I do!?

Me: Just press and hold the power button, it's on the top of the phone.

Customer (responding right away): Nothing happened

Me: You need to hold the power button for a few seconds for it to turn on

Customer (responding right away): Nothing happened

Me: I don't think you're pressing it for long enough, press and hold the top of the phone for at least 3 LONG seconds

Customer: OK, What do you mean by 'the top'?

Me (confused): Like...um...The top...? Not the front... or the sides... or the bottom... or the back... but the top...

Customer: It doesn't work!

Me: And you're pressing the top...?

Customer: I don't know!

*At this point I tried everything I could think of to try to explain what ""Top"" means, after about 5 minutes, of mind-numbing banter I can't remember I tried this:*

Me: Okay so... Put your finger on the screen...

Customer: yeah...

Me: Slide it UP! When you hit an edge, that's the top

Customer: Nothing happened

Me: Maybe we should go back to the store and see if something is broken, or if the people there can see what's wrong with the phone.

Customer: I CAN'T DO THAT

*I had one last idea to try to get her to understand what top meant:*

Me (Sad for humanity and tired): Okay... So... Look at your phone...

Customer (not angry now, just more embarrassed): okay...

Me: Your phone isn't a phone anymore, it's a person, the screen is it's face...

Customer: okay, I can see that....

Me: OKAY, so the top is Where you would put the hat!

Customer: OH! IT'S WHERE YOU WOULD PUT THE HAT!

Phone goes straight to voicemail (it doesn't.),"Sorry if there's any formatting issues, this is the first time I've done a big written post on Reddit.

Background: So I work at a small business MSP and we service about 7-8 Clients and I'm the only tech in charge of all of these clients, so I'm essentially managing 7 business daily while hoping none of them explodes on me.

One of my Clients (A Doctor's Office) calls me today stating that their phone system is not working properly, and that all calls are being routed to voicemail immediately.

Lovely people in story:

- $Zexion: The Poor sap that has to deal with this daily
- $FD: Front Desk Receptionist that told me the system is down



So I had gone to their office this morning to supervise on an ISP transition and make sure everything went through fine. $FD Tells me in passing that she's not receiving any calls. Our first conversation went a little like this:

&gt; $FD: $Zexion I think I'm not receiving any calls, the phone isn't ringing, but I have a voicemail!

&gt; $Zexion: Well That's probably because the internet just went down due to $ISP installing their modem, It's probably fine

&gt; $FD: Could you still confirm that it's working?


At which point I decide to call all 3 of their numbers (They have 3 numbers that all route to the same system) and I'm greeting with their Auto-Attendant system 

&gt; Thank you for calling $Clinic, please dial 1 for Reception


I dial 1 &amp; the phone rings and the call goes through (on all 3 numbers btw), so I tell her it's operating fine.

I get back to the office and I get yet another call from her, telling me the phone system isn't working again. At this point it's almost 2pm and I'm eating a Pizza for lunch, so I give here about 10m before I start taking a deeper look at it.

So I do the exact same thing I did earlier in the morning, Dialed all 3 numbers, pressed 1, and the call went through. Told the other receptionist that picked up the call that it's working fine and she can let $FD know that it's working fine.

I get **ANOTHER CALL** at 3pm from her, Irate, telling me that the phone system is *STILL* giving her issues. This time I have her call from her cellphone so I can hear this exact issue that she's having.

&gt; $FD: Look let me call from my cell, you'll see it goes straight to voicemail!

&gt; *Dials #*

&gt;""Thank you for calling $Clinic, please dial 1 for Reception""

&gt; $Zexion: Sounds like it's working fine for me, that's how it always goes through, you have to dial 1 afterwards.

&gt; $FD: It never worked like that however, It would always just ring my phone!

&gt; $Zexion: It *does* ring your phone, it does so *after* you press 1.

&gt;$FD: Just fix it already! I know what I'm talking about, it's never dialed this stupid system!

&gt;*$FD Then hangs up on me*



At this point I'm getting extremely infuriated so I decide to just make it so all numbers just immediately dial the front desk, with 0 impunity. I then give her a call to verify functionality.

&gt; $Zexion: *Dials*

&gt;$FD: Everything's working now! Thanks :)

&gt;*$FD Hangs up*

User is trying really hard to be relevant in front of the boss,"So we're releasing an internal tool for sales and the IT director sent a mass email to various people with access so they can test it before we do the final release.

On that email the CEO Replied All reminding everyone that to test the tool and send us any feedback bugs suggestions etc. even the minor ones so they're fixed before everyone starts using it.

This morning I received in the same Reply to All chain a series of some blowhards just replying ""Ok"" and ""I'm aware"", and one small bug one exec sent about a link being wrong, but everyone hitting Reply All so the CEO, directors, managers, all the IT team, etc. gets copied

I fix the bug and anounce it, along with one Reply All of my own reminding everyone to not send individual bugs to the Reply All chain, instead using the regular ticketing system we have for these matters.

I **immediately** receive a new ticket notification, like 5 minutes after, of someone else just forwarded the original email about the link being wrong to the ticketing email creating a new ticket OF THE VERY SAME TICKET I ANNOUNCED WAS ALREADY FIXED with a FYI note.

I'm like, dude it's me. Not only I'm failing to figure out the thinking process this guy went to in thinking he's actually doing something of value instead of just creating extra work for someone else (creating a ticket for a bug that's already fixed and he knows this) but the guy that created the ticket was not even the original person who reported it.",207,0,1,"User is trying really hard to be relevant in front of the boss So we're releasing an internal tool for sales and the IT director sent a mass email to various people with access so they can test it before we do the final release.

I'm sure it's in here somewhere...,"A story from my time in tech retail at a cellular dealership.

A customer was in wanting to make some changes to her account.  The kinds of changes she wanted to make required verifying her identity, so I asked for some ID.

Customer: Oh yes, I should have that here somewhere!

And she began a pocket dump.  But this was no ordinary pocket dump.  You see, it was summertime, she was rather well-endowed, and was wearing a low-cut top.  I don't know if this is common in larger centers, but in our small town (less than 2000 people) it's very normal for women to carry things like cell phones and smaller items tucked underneath their bra straps.  It's so common that it's completely normalized, and really treated no different than someone pulling something from their pocket.

You know how there's always that guy who only wears cargo pants and carries all manner of EDC gear in the pockets everywhere he goes?  Or that experienced mother-of-four with a bottomless handbag full of child-rearing equipment?  It was like that, but she carried it all inside her bra.

First her phone, then a pack of gum, then lipchap, a notepad, a pen, a second pen, another pack of gum, her husband's phone, a small wallet, a changebag, a small utility knife...and it just kept going.  After the first three or four items she decided it would be easier to rest her chest on the counter and tilt forward, attempting to dump everything out, or at least make it easier to pull things out.  Then it seemed that some items had fallen down underneath, so she had to plunge her hands in and root around to dig everything else out.  All with me looking on, trying to keep my customer service face in place.

Finally she managed to find her driver's license buried somewhere in a corner.

A story from my time in tech retail at a cellular dealership.

A customer was in wanting to make some changes to her account.  The kinds of changes she wanted to make required verifying her identity, so I asked for some ID.

Customer: Oh yes, I should have that here somewhere!

And she began a pocket dump.  But this was no ordinary pocket dump.  You see, it was summertime, she was rather well-endowed, and was wearing a low-cut top.  I don't know if this is common in larger centers, but in our small town (less than 2000 people) it's very normal for women to carry things like cell phones and smaller items tucked underneath their bra straps.  It's so common that it's completely normalized, and really treated no different than someone pulling something from their pocket.

My boss says it’s a firewall issue,"Hey, all. 2nd time poster. Just had one of those surreal experiences reminding me why I sink my evil developer tentacles into great IT people and never let go. 

$t1: Tier 1 Support

$hero: My light, my guide, my Tier 3 friend who knows everything

$me: Some random guy, totally unrelated to the story

So, I have an auth token, I have a company laptop, I have a client VM. All is well in the kingdom. Then it’s time to re-enroll the token, and the gremlins invade. 

To re-enroll, I have to use a shared client VM which I reach from my dedicated client VM which I reach from my company laptop...  Yeah. This’ll go smoothly. 

3 tries later, the re-enrollment VM recognizes the cert but the dedicated VM and the laptop say there’s nothing to be found. 

One 3 hour call to the Service Desk later and $t1 has pinpointed the issue. 

$t1: Ok. The cert is clearly on the token, but it’s not getting imported into your laptop’s store. This happens with remote access. You need a client laptop, because clearly your company laptop doesn’t work with tokens. 

$me: Not to second guess you, but it worked for over a year until I had to re-enroll. You sure?

$t1:  It did?  Huh. Well, my boss says when this happens, it’s a firewall issue on your machine, but he doesn’t know what. So, you must have changed the firewall. 

$me: I really don’t think...

$t1: Yeah. Something changed your firewall settings and you just can’t use that laptop to connect anymore. You need a new machine. 

$me:  Ok...  Thanks. 

I grew up in rural Michigan where cattle are raised, and there was a familiar scent in the air, so...

$me: Uh, $hero, I know you’re busy, but...

$hero: Let me look. 

&lt;5 minutes later&gt;

$hero: Ok. Yeah. See the output from certutil says no certs on the token?  That’s because there are no certs on the token. Your laptop is fine, it’s the cert that’s missing. Try re-enrolling one more time and maybe sacrifice a chicken. If that doesn’t work, go onsite, plug into a client machine and re-enroll. All good. 

$me: Thank you!  You rock!  It’s funny actually. Not to speak ill of the Service Desk guy, but he told me it was a firewall issue on *my machine* preventing imports...

$hero: Yeah, the Tier 1 guys are funny sometimes. I just took a call from someone who bought a brand new laptop because Tier 1 said her old one couldn’t be fixed.  Now her old one is working fine and her new one is a really nice paperweight.

Don't fall asleep in class,"First time poster, I hope it's suitable. A short one but there's a Tldr at the end too. 

For context, I'm not tech support, but when I was in high school I was labelled tech support by teachers and students. I'm computer literate and figure stuff out as I go, the actual technicians at my old school were 10/10, much respect for them. But during lessons, the first port of call was me and I'm not even that good. Heck, some lessons didn't even start until I walked in (even when I was late) bc they were waiting for me to help them. 

Cut to the story, one day I was in a biology lesson with a brilliant teacher whose voice, unfortunately,  put me to sleep pretty much every lesson. One time as I am waking up from a slumber, the class is quiet and I'm terrified- was I caught sleeping? Did the teacher notice? Oh sh- but then I hear mumbling and see the teacher struggling with their laptop. Relief. 
In my half lucidity, I ask ""do you need a hand with that?"" They very much accepted. 

Turns out it was a simple problem, they had their laptop extended to an external monitor and the projector screen was meant to mirror the monitor, it currently wasn't doing that.

Within about 30s, I had gone into the display settings and fixed it and taught them how to do it too, lest they forget it. And as I am about to walk away, they then tell me of another problem. Their file explorer wasn't opening at all. After verifying this (you gotta) and doing some troubleshooting, I figured I'd ask if they had updated their laptop recently. Nope, of course not. I gently told them to update it and then went on my merry way back to my seat.
Another nap successful! And some more simple problems sorted! 

TL;DR I was sleeping in class, woke up to quiet. Got scared that I was caught sleeping.

Clueless users and I DO NOT KNOW WHAT URL MEANS,"Certain details and exact wordings changed to hide identities.

Some background, I work as an IT technician for a group of companies. While I am paid by one of them, I do work for all and those hours get billed back by the company I am paid by.

The largest of these companies is a real estate company that sometimes provides other services to its commercial tenants. In the case of one of its tenants our CEO is a partial owner of it they said we will help them to upgrade their computer equipment since much of it was on 10 year old computers running windows 7.

All things considered the upgrade went very smooth, we had a few hiccups with some custom $Software that needed to be configured on site using internet explorer ONLY (yes not even edge) and then needed the software vendor to do some things after each user logged in for the first time. However, other than that the computer deployment was easy enough.

We had to hold off on one of their higher ranking employees because of some custom software that needed a code to activate. I am not sure of her title but lets call her $CAPS since every email she types to me is in all caps.

Before we deployed the computers I had to email chain with $CAPS on it where we were going over the extent of our work at this site.

&gt; Me: (Random technobabble and background information after the initial conversations outlining what needs to be upgraded also mentioning how $Software vendor manages a lot of their network equipment and has a very weird IP range)

&gt; My Manager: Okay, let me know when you want to go there and I will join you to help figure it out.

&gt; $CAPS: OKAY I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A PROCESS WE HAVE TO TALK TO ($SOFTWARE VENDOR) TO HAVE THEM WALK US THROUGH THE INSTALLATION OF THE PROGRAM

Since this was the first time I talked with her I assumed she was yelling and thinking we were chickens running with our heads cut off. Eventually I learned she is just clueless with computers and we began to deploy them. Yesterday we finally finished setting up $CAPS' computer and transferring the files over to it. She had a minor issue with some printers but we were able to solve that remotely.

Today I received an email:

&gt; $CAPS: GOOD MORNING $USER IS HAVING ISSUES WITH HIS COMPUTER HE SAYS ALL 3 COMPUTERS ARE SLOW

(Thinking to myself: Who is $User? I don't think that person was any of the people who's computers we replaced and why does a person have 3 computers?)

&gt; Me to my manager: What is the extent of our relationship with this company, since hours are being billed back I don't want to get in trouble making a site visit (the site is 5 minutes from my office and I have nothing else going on. I really just didn't want to have to deal with this company any more)

&gt; My manager on the initial email chain: We do not have remote access to that person's computers or your network. What we can do is request those computers be on the next round of upgrades.

&gt; $CAPS: THESE ARE (BRANDNAME) COMPUTERS. I GUESS WE CAN REACH OUT TO BRANDNAME TO UPGRADE THEM

I look up Brandname and find that they make mini handheld tablets for this company's industry and manage them fully. I inquire a bit with a coworker who knows a bit more about how this company operates and he informs me that these are leased devices and plenty powerful for what they need to do. As I get ready to respond $User enters the chain.

&gt; $User: Since they worked on the computer it has been slow

&gt; $Me: Since who worked on your computer? Also these computers are managed by BRANDNAME and they will be the ones to call if you are having issues with their devices

&gt; $User: From what my department is telling me that $Software has been slow since they worked on it

&gt; Me: In that case talk to $Software vendor (I am assuming that the software vendor is the ""they"" he is talking about) and they will be able to look into it. - remember $Software vendor manages their network too

At this point I am thinking to myself that this is the end of having to deal with that company and me and my coworkers are talking about putting them in contact with a local MSP to see if they can sign a contract since we really aren't going to be providing ongoing support after the hardware upgrade is done. About 10 minutes after the last email chain ended I get another message:

&gt;$CAPS: PLEASE HELP ME I NEED TO ACCESS BANKING APPLICATION AND I CAN NOT FIND IT

&gt; Me: I am not aware of how anything works on your applications. All your applications should be installed and your files transferred over in the same spots they were before. I also transferred your Internet Explorer Chrome and Edge bookmarks (yes she used all 3) but if this is done on the secure banking browser I can not access those settings to transfer over.

&gt; Me: We do not have any access to $Software, for support using it please contact them.

This woman has been working for this company for years and they never had any official IT support. We come in and within a few weeks suddenly they can't even do their jobs any more. I feel sorry for whoever their contact is at $Software vendor and the techs at the local MSP if they choose to sign with it. (I worked with one of their guys after we had a major ransomware attack on our company and needed to rebuild a whole server in an emergency and he was very good.)
For a while I thought that people like this didn't exist in the wild and definitely not in management positions. Do people get worse once they can blame their computer issues on someone else?

This woman has been working for this company for years and they never had any official IT support. We come in and within a few weeks suddenly they can't even do their jobs any more. I feel sorry for whoever their contact is at $Software vendor and the techs at the local MSP if they choose to sign with it. (I worked with one of their guys after we had a major ransomware attack on our company and needed to rebuild a whole server in an emergency and he was very good.)
For a while I thought that people like this didn't exist in the wild and definitely not in management positions. Do people get worse once they can blame their computer issues on someone else?

I have been meaning to tell a few of my more lighthearted stories on here for a while to start but I really just needed to rant about this one."
I don't know ANY of my passwords,"I'm a level 1 tech support at my universities IT department, we normally have shifts just in the computer labs around campus and help students and professors with simple tech related issues.

This was my first semester working and I wasn't yet accustom to how insane people can be.  I cut down a lot of the following exchange to keep it simple.
An older women approached my desk with her laptop and introduced herself as a professor.

Lady: ""I don't remember my login to iTunes, could you help me?""

Me: ""Sure lets use the forgot password button.  Can you type in your email?  It will send you an email so we can make a new password""

She types in her university email and I navigate to the university email login page for her.

Me: ""Okay!  Can you sign into your email for me?""

Lady: ""um.. I don't know my password for this""

Me: ""For your university email?  Okay well I can reset it for you through our IT system, do you have an ID I can see to verify your identity?""

Lady: ""I didn't bring my wallet with me!""

I stare at her large purse she has hanging from her shoulder...

Me: ""Ok well I guess we can do the forgot password option for your email too, please type your phone number in""

Her phone dings

Me: ""Great!  You should have a text with some numbers can you read them to me?""

Lady: ""I can't get to the text, I don't know my phones passcode""

Me: ""You don't know the passcode to your own phone??""

Lady: ""How am I supposed to remember so many passwords!""

At this point I'm pretty much out of options and explain for the next 15 minutes that there was nothing else I could do.  In my head I was questioning if this lady was really a professor or if she had just stolen this phone and laptop.

Me: ""Ma'am do you keep your passwords written down at home somewhere?  How do you normally open up your phone?""

Lady: ""Of course I do!  Here I have the paper in my purse!""
And she proceeded to pull out a piece of paper with every single password she needed, including the iTunes one...

I stood there shocked for a bit before helping her type in everything.  She had dozens of unread emails from her students since she appeared to have never logged into her email the entire semester.  But regardless she happily thanked me and walked away.

Whole exchange seriously lasted almost 30 minutes and made me question what kind of university I was at if we had professors like this one.  

My naivety was shown to me after a few years of working here when I realized I should've been glad she even owned a phone and knew what an email was, compared to some of the archaic professors I met later on.",1022,0,1,"I don't know ANY of my passwords I'm a level 1 tech support at my universities IT department, we normally have shifts just in the computer labs around campus and help students and professors with simple tech related issues.

It was all due to a tiny piece of plastic film.,"This happened about three hours ago.

I work in tier 2 tech support for a major telecom carrier who's name starts with V. My department is a paid service that subscribers sign up for if they feel they need it so my customers are largely technologically ignorant.

I had a husband and wife come on my line and tell me they just got the husband's new replacement phone from an insurance claim, but the volume on the handset speaker when on a voice call is so limited that they can barely hear a muffle when off of speaker phone.

Foolishly, I immediately assume their replacement phone has a bad part, and begin planning to hand them back off to the third party insurance carrier, but I have to run through our troubleshooting guide first.

I have them power cycle the phone and call them on it - Nothing.  
I re-sync their connection to the switch and to our billing network - Nothing.  
The third page of our troubleshooting guide is:
&gt;""Check for packaging material, plastic film or foil on top of the screen.""

I almost skip it. A little bit of plastic film wouldn't completely goddamn deafen the speaker.

The lying user that was accidentaly right,"I work in application maintenance. Fixing incorrect data in the DB, killing/restarting stuck processes, things like thay. All of which is done when asked to via ticket. The usual.

Anyway, I got a ticket the other day that could be summed up as ""Please do **$action** on **$list_of_things**"".  
Now, the thing is, we only work on anomalies. Meaning, if it's something that can be done via the interface, as a normal use of the application, then though luck, you're on your own. And it happens that the **$action** the user was asking me to do was doable with the interface.

Wasn't the first time I got a ticket like that. The application I work on is antiquated and a lot of actions are long and tedious, so sometimes when a user has to do these actions on a lot of stuff (as was the case here) they try to open a ticket in the hope that we'll do it instead of them. No dice though, I sent the ticket back explaining how to do **$action** (I learned that Hanlon's Razor was *very* applicable to my job) and moved to something else.

A while after, the ticket is reopened, with the user saying something to the effect of ""I did **$action** on a couple of **$things**, but then they didn't change state."". Yeah, RIGHT. 

I decide to check myself and pick one **$thing** to do **$action** on. Look, the button is there, not even greyed out... Fully prepared to answer the ticket with ""ok I literally just did it and it works so you can do it yourself you numbnut instead of expecting me to do your job for you"", I click on the button...  
And lo and behold, the widget it opens is completely broken. Normally you have a couple of fields to fill, then a button to click to validate. Here, the first field doesn't work at all, there is no button anywhere (can't even close the widget), and there's a bunch of HTML in a text field, which at a glance seems like it should be the rest of the page instead of being written inside a text field.

So, the user WAS lying. He told me he did **$action** and it had no effect. But he can't have done it because it doesn't work *at all*.  
In other word, this dude, in lying to try and get me to do his job for him, lucked out and got me to find an *actual* anomaly. I am baffled.

Still not gonna do his job for him though. He can do it himself once I've fixed the bug.",1856,0,1,"The lying user that was accidentaly right I work in application maintenance.

The missing mails,"Okay so this story happened today and is probably my favorite ticket this month. I could have maybe solved that one in a few seconds, but instead my brain chose the long path...

I'm working for a construction company, and my job is basically taking care of everything that whispers ""IT""... You know what I mean. 

So today a construction manager called me, because he had problems with some mails. He usually gets all his mails on his computer in Outlook and on his iPhone in the mail app.

But for whatever reason some mails were only displayed on his iPhone, and not on his computer. Which seemed weird, as both devices are connected with our Exchange server and test mails arrived at both devices.

Well, so the trouble shooting began. Firewall, spam filter, exchange protocolls - looked good. Mails were not present in OWA as well. 

So by then I noticed, that all the ""missing"" mails came from the same guy. So I took a closer look at those mails. And in those mails, somewhere inbetween 15 other recipients, there was [""cmanager@icloud.com](mailto:""cmanager@icloud.com)"".

The printer isn't working! You need to come in immediately!,"I'm an intern for a company right now and IT isn't actually my job, but I'm very Tech savvy. My work got laptops for everyone and I told them I could easily transfer their files from old computer to the new ones. Basically just a copy and paste job. So I copy and paste files from old computers to the new laptops and then head home. The staff isn't fully using these laptops yet as we had to purchase microsoft word and there isn't wifi set up in the building yet. So the laptops aren't fully ready to go yet. The next day is my day off when I get awoken by my phone ringing. I answer and one of my coworkers tells me that Janes computer isn't printing.

Me: Her new laptop isn't printing?

Coworker: yea its not printing.  
Me: Just tell her to print from her Old computer, everything is still hooked up.

COworker: she says her old computer isn't printing either.

Me: Well that's weird, I didn't do anything that should have effected her printer.  
Coworker: We need you to come in right now and fix this.  
ME: Sure, I'll be right there, can I talk to Jane?

Jane: Hello my computer isn't printing

Me:Did you try printing from your old computer

Jane:Yes I did and nothing came out of the printer

Me:OKay, because nothing should have changed on your old computer so it hypothetically should be able to print. the new laptop isn't set up yet though. You're not trying to print from the laptop, right?

Jane: No I'm not on the laptop, both computers aren't printing.

Me:Did any thing pop up or any windows open saying low ink or error

Jane: No nothing popped up

Me:Okay is the printer on?

Jane yes its on

Me: OKay is the printer name listed when you open the document to print

Jane: I don't know

Me: okay Maybe it got disconnected. I can come take a look but I didn't do anything that should have effected your printer. So If its a major issue then we will have to call the printer maintenance guys.  


After that point I get to the office and go into her office I see her laptop open and her desktop has a black screen. I go to the desktop and wiggle the house but it stays black.   
Jane: It was like that when I came in! I don't know whats wrong with it.  
Me: It looks like its turned off

Jane: I didn't do that. I never turn my computer off. 

Me: (realizing that jane 100% did not actually try printing from her desktop computer and wondering if she just lied during our entire conversation where I had her walk me through step by step as she tried to print) Well I turned it off after I finished working on it yesterday.  


I then turn the computer on by pressing the power button and the log in screen opens

Me: Can you type your password in for me

Jane: I don't know the password.   
ME: Its probably the same password you normally use for everything  
Jane: (rummages through her desk until she finds a sticky note) I've never had to log in before. I don't ever turn the computer off.

I log in, open word and immediately print.

&amp;#x200B;

Jane: Oh My GOD! You fixed the printer!!!!

Me: Uh yea, Jane, do you know how to turn the computer on?

Jane: No, I don't need to though since I just never turn it off. 

Everything starts to click into place for me and all the comments from jane about how slow her computer was running come to mind. I then show her the power button and then go to our boss who I inform that the issue was resolved and that the issue was that Jane didn't know how to turn her computer on. This alarms my boss who then at the next meeting informs everyone that they should be turning their computers off at least once a week.  


I go to my coworker's office and let her know that Janes real problem isn't the printer but the fact she doesn't know how to turn computers on. I at this point am in almost complete disbelief that people in my office who use computers every single day have no idea how to do something so basic as turning on the computer. Mind-blowing. But then again there is a woman who is a couple of years away from retiring who doesn't know the alphabet (American born and raised, only knows the English language and went to public school) and I know there are a lot of people who don't understand computers but I figure that if you use a computer every single day, all day long, you should probably know the basics. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR; Got called into work on my day off because my coworker didn't know how to turn on her computer and apparently has never turned a computer on or off before.

Edit: holy cow thank you for my very first ever reddit award! I feel like I should celebrate this!!! This feels like a really big achievement to me!!
2nd edit: oh geez two awards in one day!!! This is honestly the best day I’ve had in a long long time. Thank you!",1071,0,1,"The printer isn't working! You need to come in immediately! I'm an intern for a company right now and IT isn't actually my job, but I'm very Tech savvy. My work got laptops for everyone and I told them I could easily transfer their files from old computer to the new ones. Basically just a copy and paste job. So I copy and paste files from old computers to the new laptops and then head home. The staff isn't fully using these laptops yet as we had to purchase microsoft word and there isn't wifi set up in the building yet. So the laptops aren't fully ready to go yet. The next day is my day off when I get awoken by my phone ringing. I answer and one of my coworkers tells me that Janes computer isn't printing.

Me: Her new laptop isn't printing?

Coworker: yea its not printing.  
Me: Just tell her to print from her Old computer, everything is still hooked up.

COworker: she says her old computer isn't printing either.

Me: Well that's weird, I didn't do anything that should have effected her printer.  
Coworker: We need you to come in right now and fix this.  
ME: Sure, I'll be right there, can I talk to Jane?

Jane: Hello my computer isn't printing

Me:Did you try printing from your old computer

Jane:Yes I did and nothing came out of the printer

Me:OKay, because nothing should have changed on your old computer so it hypothetically should be able to print. the new laptop isn't set up yet though. You're not trying to print from the laptop, right?

Jane: No I'm not on the laptop, both computers aren't printing.

Me:Did any thing pop up or any windows open saying low ink or error

Jane: No nothing popped up

Me:Okay is the printer on?

Jane yes its on

Me: OKay is the printer name listed when you open the document to print

Jane: I don't know

Me: okay Maybe it got disconnected. I can come take a look but I didn't do anything that should have effected your printer. So If its a major issue then we will have to call the printer maintenance guys.  


After that point I get to the office and go into her office I see her laptop open and her desktop has a black screen. I go to the desktop and wiggle the house but it stays black.   
Jane: It was like that when I came in! I don't know whats wrong with it.  
Me: It looks like its turned off

Jane: I didn't do that. I never turn my computer off. 

Me: (realizing that jane 100% did not actually try printing from her desktop computer and wondering if she just lied during our entire conversation where I had her walk me through step by step as she tried to print) Well I turned it off after I finished working on it yesterday.  


I then turn the computer on by pressing the power button and the log in screen opens

Me: Can you type your password in for me

Jane: I don't know the password.   
ME: Its probably the same password you normally use for everything  
Jane: (rummages through her desk until she finds a sticky note) I've never had to log in before. I don't ever turn the computer off.

I log in, open word and immediately print.

&amp;#x200B;

Jane: Oh My GOD! You fixed the printer!!!!

Me: Uh yea, Jane, do you know how to turn the computer on?

Jane: No, I don't need to though since I just never turn it off. 

Everything starts to click into place for me and all the comments from jane about how slow her computer was running come to mind. I then show her the power button and then go to our boss who I inform that the issue was resolved and that the issue was that Jane didn't know how to turn her computer on. This alarms my boss who then at the next meeting informs everyone that they should be turning their computers off at least once a week.

Why would you need data in the new building?,"Context: I'm a Senior Engineer in a secondary school, and have co-managed the IT department for the past year and a half.

This is one of those stories where I am absolutely stunned that it even happened. It may sound made up. It may seem unbelievable. But I assure you it is not. The threshold for human stupidity is absurdly vast.

It's also a long one, so I apologise.

Buckle your seat belts, this is going to get wild.

Background: 
Last year the school I work in managed to secure funding from the local council for renovations and expansions to the campus. Due to local primary schools taking on more children, it's had a knock on effect and our student body has increased by an average of 30 students per year over the past four years. That may not sound like much, however that's a whole classroom of kids extra every year. So, of course, we needed to expand.

It started out with the erection of 12 pods in the open areas of the school - not too big, but big enough to fit 12 students in comfortably. Perfect for Sixth Form lessons. The only problem is that they are made of metal, have built in air-con units mounted on the top, and were directly in the paths of a number of our wireless access points. So our wireless signal suffered as a result.

If they had consulted my department, I would have told them that it may have happened and would have prepared to reconfigure the setup ahead of time. Alas, they did not and so I ended up having to rush to do it, after I found out about the plans. At first the school's account holder (the Deputy Head) was reluctant to spend the money to reconfigure the wireless setup and it got held up. However, after complaints started pouring in he signed off on the funding. Not the way I would have liked things to go down, but you live and learn. All in all it turned out better than expected. (He was so shocked by how badly the signal was affected, and the complaints that we forwarded on, that he even agreed to upgrade our access points, which I was glad about since they were EOL pending and weren't accepting any firmware updates. - Yippee)

After this was all resolved I had a meeting with the Head, Deputy Head and Business Manager and told them that if there was any building work in the future they should consult with myself or someone else on my team during the planning stage. Purely so that we could avoid anything like this happening again.

They agreed.

They, my friends, *lied.*

And so our story begins:

Deep into lockdown, I got a call on my personal mobile from from the Deputy Head at about 9.30pm. My usual work day finishes at 4. Naturally, I let it ring out. I don't like answering work calls outside of work hours as I believe it breeds dependancy. But he called again. So I figured it was either something Covid-related, or at least urgent in some other way.

DH: I'm really sorry for calling you at home, but it's an emergency. Are you okay to talk? 

Me: Yeah, I'm fine. What's up?

DH: I just signed the paperwork for a new building and I want to know what we need.

Me: Excuse me? I didn't know a new building was planned. Where is it going? When's the work start? Why haven't I heard about this before?

DH: I was keeping it a secret to surprise staff coming back after the summer. Only Senior Leadership, and now you, know. Its replacing the temporary hut out the back of the canteen. Work starts Monday.

At this point my bullshit detector starts going off something *fierce.* Monday was four days away, and no way would him signing the paperwork that night already have that start date organised. My best guess is that he signed everything weeks ago, and then before the work started realised he hadn't contacted me.

After some questioning I find out that this new building is going to have 6 rooms, spread over two floors, with one of the rooms being used for our GAP program, so that will need at least 5 PCs in it. There is also going to be another smaller one room building next to it that will be used as an office.

I tell him straight up, he can't transplant the data from the old hut into the new building. The hut had a rack, but a small one, and only had a normal switch in it. For a building of that size, and with the office next door, he would need a Power Over Ethernet switch - for phones (we use VOIP) and wireless APs. It would also need to be managed, so that I can configure and assign the VLANs. In addition it would need aircon in the room that the switch is in to keep it cool, as well as the 5 PCs, three wireless APs at least, and a 65"" television in each room so that teachers can display their lesson PowerPoints. The only things we could salvage from the old hut are the physical data run from the server room, and the cabinet the old switch was in.

He agrees with my recommendations and asks me to order the necessary equipment the next day. He also tells me he will speak to our Site Manager about organising the data to be included in the plans.

Needless to say I trust this man about as far as I can throw him. So after I put my orders in I go and speak to the site manager myself.

Our building is not owned by the school, but leased from a Third Party Company, so the site manager works for them and any building work or physical maintenance needs to go through her.

Me: Hey, SM has DH contacted you about the data in the new building?

SM: No. What data?

*deep breath*

Me: We need data included in the plans, so that it all works. I've got wireless APs and phones and computers to go in, so I need the data sorted.

SM: There's no data on the floorplan and construction plans.

Me: Let's have a look.

She was right. No data cabling. No Ethernet ports. No space to put the cabinet. Nothing. NOTHING.

Me: F@ck. This all needs to be there. It won't function as anything more than a holding pen otherwise.

SM: The school didn't budget for any of that. And works all ready to go after the weekend. You'll need to speak to senior leadership and get them to contact the building company about all of that.

So I meet with SLT about what's happened. I can tell from the looks on their faces they have no idea what the hell I'm taking about. So I use small words. I write it down and talk them to forward what I've written to the company. Eventually they agree to contact the building company and use my specifications. 

Work starts and I assume its all in order. I program my switch, I add my APs to Radius, I get my apprentice to image the PCs, I test the phones. All looking good.

Periodically I check with the site manager for an update as I'm not allowed on the building site. All going well I'm told. Splendid. 

Until one day the manager of the building works comes up to me and asks what's going on with data.

I appear confused. It's two weeks before the summer is over. The kids will be back soon. We need the extra space for social distanced learning. What does he mean? We sorted the data, right? I show him my email I forwarded to SLT.

""Nah, never seen that.""

He shows me the plans they were working off. No data. At all. 

Not only that, when they were working they found the old physical data run to the old hut and ripped it up because they didn't know what it was. The also binned the old cabinet. And switch - a perfectly fine Aruba.

Holy. Shit.

I called the Deputy Head, and told him what was going on, in a panic.

DH: Oh no, I think we might have forgotten that. Is it that important?

*Is this man for real?*

One person forgetting this I could forgive. Not understand, but forgive. Maybe two.

But senior leadership is 9 members. I spoke to all of them. I gave them the specifications - they literally just had to forward them. I spoke to the site manager regularly. Why didn't she realise it was forgotten?

What?

*WHAT??*

I now have no location to put the switch. No cabinet. No data run from my servers. No air con. No Ethernet ports anywhere. No data of any kind!

Teachers cant teach there. They all use laptops, and we have no external WiFi on that side of the building. And even if we did I doubt it'd be very stable. Nowhere to plug in computers. So all our GAP students can't have lessons. No ports for phones. So the office staff in the small building next door can't work.

How? How does something so essential go through so many hands and still get forgotten?

We don't want to be FIRED for doing YOUR job!,"First time post. I'm not the best at story telling but here it is my story from an experience I had. 

Players: Nice Lady (NL), Rude Lady (RL), Me

So I work for an MSP as tech support. I got a call from a client in an offsite location where only two ladies worked. The first lady, which was fairly nice with the whole situation, called in about 3 different issues. I went through the first two issues and resolved them fairly quickly. But oh boy, when the 3rd issue came up, things got a little more intense.

The third issue related to a kiosk computer connected to a touch screen TV. 

NL: Okay, and the third issue is the kiosk computer. It isn't connecting to the internet. 

Me: I can help you with that. What are you seeing on the screen?

NL: I see .... (lists a bunch of different things)

Me: That sounds like it is the TV menu. Can you find the input on the TV and select HDMI?

NL: Sure. \*mumbles to herself as she goes through the TV menus\* Okay, got it! I see some tiles now.

Me: So you can see Windows now?

NL: Yeah, but it's saying it isn't connected.

Me: Okay, do you see the internet icon on the bottom right of the task bar?

At this point she says no and tried to describe what she sees which sounded completely foreign to me. I don't know what she is looking at. I was thinking maybe she was looking at that Windows tile screen that you might see on tablets and I was trying to get her to the desktop. After several minutes of her trying to describe the screen and me trying to guide her to the desktop, RL jumped in and started talking with so much attitude.

RL: This is taking WAY too long. You guys need to fix this! We don't want to get fired because YOU can't do your job! We don't have time for this. We have things to do. We don't have all day to do your job for you.

Me: I apologize this is taking some time but I need you to get to the desktop so we can get you connected to the WIFI.

NL: I found some WIFI settings. \*proceeds to say what she sees\*

Me: That sounds like the WIFI menu for the TV. Have you tried restarting the computer? (in IT when all else fails, try rebooting)

NL: Yes, we did that.

RL: This is ridiculous. You need to get this fixed! Help me, help you! (in a very condescending tone) What are we paying you for?

There were other rude and condescending lines like that, that I can't really remember. At that point, I escalated the issue to our senior admin, because I was at a loss and RL was just getting more and more upset. I mean, if you can't even get to the desktop, I don't know what to do for you. So I informed my admin about the whole situation and he called them some time later. 

Before he called them I was talking about it with my colleague, just kind of laughing it off. ""I bet the computer wasn't even on and they were just looking at the TV menus."" LOL. Moments later my admin lets me know that the computer wasn't on and they apologized to me. I'm certain it was the NL that said that. You could tell she felt bad as RD was unleashing her fury upon me.

This was confusing at the moment because she said she saw Windows and she said SHE RESTARTED THE COMPUTER! If the computer was off the whole time, what did she restart?

Networking was new, DOS was king, and Windows 2.1 would occasionally surface. I was in a Big Iron Shop (Mainframe, for the new kids on the block) and would help out with PC problems in the area.

I, realizing that agreeing to him meant that I would get the second PC on the floor, kept my mouth shut.)
  
By the way, the director had me set up his PC. And was tooting my skills to all of his director friends, and billing them for my work. 
  
So the adjacent group has set up a printer network... For the youn'uns, back then, PCs looking to print to a shared printer, would be connected through the SERIAL port to a network with a dedicated print server and printer. Boys and girls... Notice that there was no network as you know these days. There was a cable to print, and the equivalent of a network card to plug in the coax to the mainframe's modem. 
  
The adjacent group bought a custom solution for printing involving a custom plug with a port that looked like an RJ45 port, but wasn't. Because computers were new, this was before standards. (And, later, was denied as an acceptable standard.) 
  
And back to my director... He arranged with the director of the adjacent group that I would be their tech support.
  
And then the manager of said group was posted elsewhere. And he negotiated that he would keep his PC. Big deal given that he would have received a mainframe terminal otherwise. My job was to pack up the PC for shipping. Up two floors and down the corridor.
  
I disconnected everything and boxed up the parts that would go with him. Except for that funny little connector that permitted him to connect to the print server. Which I put in the box to remain behind.
  
Full freak out... That was his! He bought it with his department's funds. He absolutely needed it where he was going. I was equally adament that this was purely for him to connect to the printing network functioning at this location. Any connection needed at his new place would be provided there. It wasn't our responsibility to provide wiring from here to his new place so he could print here. He had negotiated that the computer was to go and this was connected and therefore part of the computer. 
  
I was nearly written up for insubordination... Except he wasn't in my chain of command. So he couldn't. However, he kept the plug. And his old director had to buy a new one at a cost of (I believe) $350 for the person moving into his old office.
  
And did he use said plug? Nope, absolutely never. It was mailed to me five months later. Not to his old director, I add. 
  
I was amused to hear that, during the radiator cleaning shortly thereafter, he insisted on watching the cleaners and therefore found himself doused by dirty water as the rad was cleaned with a high pressure hose. And, before you ask, I was on vacation that week.

He would be retired by now. Unless he isn't. But that was government.

Old man is abusive and gets banned from the store,"This has happened over the past few days, and I've aged 10 years from dealing with this man. For context, I work in tech support at a popular office supply store. 

This all started when this old man, maybe 70-75, brought in his old desktop along with a new one for a data transfer. That's all fine and dandy, we inform him we have a 3 day turn around time (we were pretty busy). Fast forward 3 days, and the customer calls and goes off the rails. He's screaming and cursing at my manager over the phone furious that it wasn't done in only a day because ""there's no data on the old one."" I could hear him over the phone and I was standing 20 feet away.

Somehow we managed to get him off the phone, and like we told him, his computer was done on that third day. He came and picked it up, looking it over first and signing off on a waiver saying that the service was done properly. All ends well, right? Wrong, it's only just getting fun.

The next day (today), he calls and is INSTANTLY screaming when I pick up. His ""wifi"" doesn't work. Turns out he meant his wireless keyboard, and it didn't work because it was still plugged into the old computer. 
Twenty minutes later he calls again... Also screaming. His background image isn't changing every 5 minutes, only once a day. Now I'd have helped him, except he refused to bring the computer back in. He demanded I fix it over the phone. I told him it wasn't possible, and he blows up on me cursing me out and screaming so loud I can't even understand him. He hangs up after a few minutes.
Another twenty minutes later he calls again, still screaming. Notice a pattern yet? This time he's mad because the off button on the computer isn't a shortcut on the desktop. I walk him through where the real button is. It's 3 clicks total.

""That's too complicated, I can't do that every time. Change it for me""

""Sir, that's how Microsoft designed windows 10, I can't change it.""

""What the **** do you mean? It has nothing to ****ing do with ****ing Microsoft, CHANGE IT!""

""I'm really sorry sir, but I ca-""

""I SAID ****ING CHANGE IT YOU PIECE OF ****, I DIDNT SPENT $90 FOR THIS ****TY SERVICE!""

""Sir if you're going to act like this I'll have to hang up.""

""NO YOU ****ING WONT, YOURE GOING TO ****ING FIX IT FOR ME, MY STEPSON SAID IT WAS POSSIBLE""

""Get your stepson to do it then, because I won't be treated like this.""

""I PAID GOOD MONEY FOR THIS SERVICE, SO YOU HAD BETTER ****ING FIX IT OR-""

""SIR, as respectfully as possible, DEAL WITH IT."" *I hang up while he's still yelling.*

He called back again a few minutes later and demanded to talk to a manager. He proceeded to scream at them too, and get hung up on several times. Eventually, after like 4 calls, my manager issued a refund to his credit card just to get him out of our hair.

Thankfully, that was the end of it. PSYCH. He called again an hour later, screaming that he hadn't gotten his refund yet. Everybody knows it takes like 4-7 business days for that stuff, but he didn't care. We had to fax him proof that it was issued.

We also, politely, informed him that he is no longer welcome here and that he has no right to mistreat our staff. 

""I WORKED IN RETAIL FOR YEARS AND NEVER ONCE HUNG UP ON SOMEBODY"" he told my manager, to which my manager said ""Then you never met anybody who acted the way you do.""

Almost every phone call was like 10 minutes of him screaming too, not short conversations. We tried to reason with him a thousand times. He wouldn't have it.

We didn't have a list of customers who we refuse to deal with. We do now.

Good riddance.

"GM insists, no need to map x drive since server is in next room. She's currently looking for files in server room","First time writing post, trying to keep it short and understandable.  

Am self employed and have contract with a specific major hotel chain to fix, upgrade anything IT related in their hotels in my area. 

So, today was going to be a easy day, or so I thought. 
Quick HDD replacement in a hotel owned laptop for GM. Usually really fast job. Swapp HDD, connect to server, download and run few files. Max 1 hr (with issues). 

I get there, GM isnt the brightest as I notice within a few minutes. I introduce myself, explain why I'm there. She asks what I'm there, explain I need package IT department shipped, and laptop. She finally finds the laptop and directs me to do my job in the Lobby. Ok odd, but whatever. It will do for now. 
After swap, I need network. This is where the fin begins. Am trying to explain to her I need secure network, guest wifi doesnt cut it. I need to connect to the server to access some files. 
She doesn't get it. Says guest wifi works good on her phone, even for files. 
I give up, call IT department. 
I speak to let's call him Mark, explain she wont let me connect to internet to access server files. Mark asks to speak to GM. It's on speakerphone. 
Convo goes like this: 

Mark :This is Mark from Hotel IT, am I speaking to GM?

GM: yes, this is GM from Hotel xyz. 

Mark: GM, I need my tech to connect to your secure internet, she needs to map a drive to access some files on the server, tondownload programs, and that is not possible through guest wifi. 

GM: Mark, I dont think its nessecary for tech to connect to server for files. The server is right here, she can find those folders there. 

Mark: Deep breath, quiet barely holding it together voice.. ok Thank you GM. Tech, you can go home, your work is done here. But before you hang up, can I quick speak to GM? GMn I will call you in 5 minutes, in the meantime, can you go into the server room, and find folder x with files xyz. 

GM: feeling victorious. Yes Mark, I will go look for those folders for you. Thank you tech, thank you mark I will speak to you soon. 

I take my phone and leave. Am done. Mark calls me back, tells me hes gonna have some fun. He already forwarded the info on a ticket to tech support in India.  Its gonna be a few days.


Update: I know it's been a few days, sorry guys busy week because the hurricane that hit near us. 
Anyways, Mark gave me a call and gave me the follow up. 
Somehow this lady managed to piss tech support in India off. 
After a few calls between Tech support and GM's higher ups, it was determined to teach her a lesson. (Again). 
2 things will happen

1) So instead of them sending me to fix the issue (literally plug in to ethernet, add to domain, and download a few files) , they shipped her a box with label to send the laptop in to have this done. 
This will take a while to get done and shipped back to her. 
2)She is send for training and no more from home access to her work. 

Having been a GM myself for 5 years befor I switched fields, I have a feeling this was not her first fuck up and she probably got a demotion.

New to You Ink cartridge,"I love my mother but she is not computer (or phone) savvy. I’m no tech whiz but I can usually fix what she manages to break. Usually the errors are caused by clicking everything potentially related repeatedly. This has lead to 20 Or more copies of a document being printed because she just kept clicking! 

Today, she texted me that the printer was broken. I video chatted with her so I could see what she was doing as her descriptions of icons are comical at best and often leave me scratching my head trying to figure out what she’s talking about.(For instance the Bluetooth icon is the sideways spaceship!)

I went through all the common printer error fixes. Had her check cords and power cycle. Even had her reset the print spooler. Nothing. She’s getting really frustrated And then blurts out that maybe Jan (her friend) gave her a faulty ink cartridge. 

Turns out Jan was upgrading her printer and asked my mom if she wanted any ink. My mom said yes and somehow managed to jam Jan’s ink cartridge into the printer. They were not the same cartridge number (or brand) and she had to “really push” to make it fit.

But...your PC doesn't have an optical drive....,"This story takes place exactly 20 years ago, give or take a few days.  (Mid-Summer of '00.)  I was working for a medical center at the time, and while we had a centralized IT department, satellite locations would have an embedded IT guy on site so that they didn't have to keep sending someone down from the main building for routine issues.  Since I was the ranking FNG, I was the guy assigned to our financial services office...home of the least tech-savvy folks in the entire organization, and thus some of the more frustrating issues.  This was a transitional period for us, as we were going from a 100% analog paper-and-bankers-boxes archive to a digital CD-based one.  Older records were still on paper, but newer ones were systematically being scanned in and shredded.  So if someone had to retrieve a record from within the past year-ish, we had a dedicated PC for that purpose.  You'd search the database on the archive PC and it would tell you which CD to look for, and what the file name was.  You'd then go find the CD, pop it in the drive, grab the file, and return the CD to the rack.  Not too difficult, and most people learned how it works without too much hand-holding.

Well I got a call one day from a lady who complained that the PC was eating her CD's.  I asked her if she could elaborate on that, and she said ""Every time I put a CD in the computer, it doesn't work.  I've put 3 or 4 CD's in already and none of them work.""  I asked what she meant by eating, and she said ""None of the CD's ever came back out.""

The hell?  OK so now I'm confused, because it suddenly hits me...I've been at my desk all day.  The archive PC is in a little nook off to my left, in plain sight...and no one has been there all day.  I ask her when this happened, and she says ""Just a few minutes ago!""  I explain to her that the archive PC is back by me, and no one has been there all day.   And she replies ""Oh no, I didn't want to sit back there in the corner, so I took the CD's back to my desk.""

Excuse me?  Sorry but none of the PC's in this office are equipped with optical drives.  The only PC with an optical drive is the dedicated archive PC, back by me.  ""Well you must be mistaken because mine does.""  At this point I'm definitely picking up some Dunning-Kruger vibes, so I tell her to sit tight while I come over to see what she's doing.  I reach her desk, ask her to demonstrate the issue...which she does by shoving a CD between the drive bay covers on the front of her PC.  I heard the disc clatter to the bottom of the chassis, and it was all I could to not to rip out my hair right then and there.  I ended up taking her PC back with me, opening it up, and fishing the CD's out.  Half of them needed to be resurfaced thanks to her carelessness.  I got her PC all put back together, got her workstation set back up, and explained to her that she needs to use the archive PC.  I explicitly stated that her PC does not have a CD-ROM drive, and that the gap she was shoving the discs into was just a gap.  There was nothing in there.

I get a call about 30 minutes later from her.  ""Whatever you did, it didn't fix the problem.  My PC is still eating the CD's.""

So once again I retrieve her PC, open it up, dig the discs out, and put in a call to maintenance.  I had a guy come over with a tube of silicone putty, which I used to physically seal the gap between the drive bay covers.  I kept the PC back with me for an extra hour to let the putty cure, while I resurfaced the discs while contemplating how much whisky I was going to need at the end of the day, then set her workstation back up AGAIN.  I tried my best to explain to her using very small words how her PC can't use CD's, and even if it could, she doesn't have the database that tells her which records are on what CD. I reiterate that she *must* use the dedicated archive PC because it's the only one with a CD drive, and the only one with the database.  She nods in apparent understanding.

10 minutes later, ""Something is still wrong with my PC, I can't get the CD's in the drive anymore.""

At this point I told her that I was going to get back to her on the issue and terminated the call.  I sent the write-up of all three calls to her supervisor, along with an email that basically said ""Tech support is my job, making sure your employees can do their jobs is yours.  Fix this.""  (Of course worded a lot more politely and tactfully--this is just the short version.)  Apparently her ineptitude extended to many other areas and damaging the archive CD's was the straw that broke the camel's back, because she was no longer employed the following day.",1142,0,1,"But...your PC doesn't have an optical drive....

I reiterate that she *must* use the dedicated archive PC because it's the only one with a CD drive, and the only one with the database.  She nods in apparent understanding.

10 minutes later, ""Something is still wrong with my PC, I can't get the CD's in the drive anymore.""

At this point I told her that I was going to get back to her on the issue and terminated the call.  I sent the write-up of all three calls to her supervisor, along with an email that basically said ""Tech support is my job, making sure your employees can do their jobs is yours.  Fix this.""  (Of course worded a lot more politely and tactfully--this is just the short version.)  Apparently her ineptitude extended to many other areas and damaging the archive CD's was the straw that broke the camel's back, because she was no longer employed the following day."
My grandmother made my mom drive two hours to plug in a cable 😂,"My grandparents are my favorite people. They have always helped me and loved me. But they have not entered the 21. Century yet.

A few years ago my grandmother called my mom who is good with tech stuff, because she couldn't get the printer to work. My mom sat patiently and tried helping her for an hour before realizing that she couldn't help over the phone because my grandmother was afraid of touching any buttons. So that weekend we drove the two hour drive to my grandparents to visit and fix the printer. My mom went in to their office, plugged the printercable in the wall and suddenly it printet like 20 of the same recipe that my grandmother wanted to cook. 

Another time at Christmas I gave my grandmother a cheap smartphone and she really loved it, but she always did something wrong and messed it up. I don't know how because I told her exactly which buttons she should touch and which she should avoid. Anyway, she called and said that she couldn't log in. I asked if she had tried too many times, and she didn't know. I asked if it said PUK-code, and she didn't know. After a while she realized that yes it was in fact asking for a PUK-code. I told her to find her calender because I had written all the passwords down for her. I asked her to find the Puk-code and she couldn't, so after a while she gave up. She decided to drive the 30 minutes to my apartment (I had moved closer to her) so that I could take a look. I opened her calender, found the password page where I had written the Puk-code with big letters and I unlocked her phone. 

She once got almost mad at me because I told her that she had to find her email address and password to log into Facebook from my computer. She said that her computer always just logged right in by itself. I said that mine does too but with my account and not hers. 

She is the sweetest old lady and I love her so much, but sometimes I really have to take a deep breath 😂😂",1539,0,1,"My grandmother made my mom drive two hours to plug in a cable 😂 My grandparents are my favorite people.

"You realize remote appointments are for people who are REMOTE, right?","This happened years ago, long before COVID-19, so the situation is obviously *very* different now. 

I used to work in my university's Writing Center. For those of you who are unfamiliar, it's a place where students can go to get a second pair of eyes on whatever document they were working on. We helped with grammar, content, research... basically everything short of editing the paper for you. 

I was a tutor, but I often found myself in an unofficial tech support role. Many of our students were adults returning to college after a decade or two in the workforce, and were unfamiliar with tools like Microsoft Office or Canvas, so I was often called in during gaps in my schedule to help out. 

One service we offered was online consultations. These were the *bane* of our existence, for multiple reasons. First, we were limited to university computers that would reset to a default image every evening. Our official tech division kept things like Chrome and Office updated on the main image, but Skype was something exclusive to the tutoring department. As such, whenever we found ourselves with an online appointment, we had to *reinstall Skype.* As students could make online appointments *seconds* before the appointment window, there were multiple occasions where a furious student would call the front desk asking where we were as we frantically tried to update our client. We switched to Hangouts eventually, though I don't know what they're doing now since I've left.

Next, once the connection was made, there was always some manner of technical issue. Online appointments were intended for students who either lived off campus, had work or family schedules that limited their ability to come in person, or who were sick (we were a high contact location, and I went through so much hand sanitizer. Glad I graduated before COVID). This meant that our online clients were older students with children, often in our nursing program. I *loved* my clients, but 70% of them did not understand how a microphone worked. They'd often hook up their Apple Earbuds (this was pre-EarPods) and try and talk into that tiny microphone on the wire... without setting the correct input first. We had to devote an extra 30 minutes to these first time online sessions just for troubleshooting.

Then there was the matter of actually opening the document, since we didn't have any remote desktop software. Our best solution was to get the student to upload their document to Google, after which I'd activate collaboration mode and start annotating. Many students have never used Google Drive, so I ended up awkwardly screen sharing more than once. One student even *copy and pasted their entire essay into the chat.*

Needless to say, this wasn't super popular among us tutors. Still, we understood why we had it, and did our best... but there was always a problem client. One Sunday, I had a coworker come to me with grim tidings. She looked like she was about to tell me my dog died or something. No... I had been assigned *that* client. She was a freshman, straight out of high school, and definitely a Karen in Training. She had gone through nearly *every tutor we had,* rejecting them after they failed to meet her needs, before moving on to the next. She also operated exclusively online, and *could not* grasp our online appointment system. Often, she'd get short with people for even trying to explain.

I stared blankly at my screen for a moment, before nodding and setting up my station. I wasn't going to let this woman get the best of me. 

I put on my best customer service voice, logged into Hangouts, and smiled. ""Hello, welcome to the Writing Center. I'm OP. How can I help you?""

All of those issues I mentioned above? The trouble with voice? Getting Google Drive to Work? We had all of them. She even had the earbuds of shame. But I am, if anything, a master of self-depreciation. I knew she would get angry if I blamed anything on *her*. Fortunately, my Customer Service game is really strong, so she was pleased with my efforts... though she did frequently mention how ""none of those other tutors could help me.""

 I didn't want to blame my fellow tutors for her problems. For one, I knew full well they were *her* fault, and two... they were my friends! Comrades! So, after spending 20 minutes working through her tech issues, I decided to use one of my old scapegoats... university internet.

""Sorry about all the trouble,"" I said. ""The internet on campus has been acting up lately.""

""Oh, tell me about it."" she said. ""The internet has been slow in my dorm all day!""

...I paused.

""Your... dorm? You live on campus?"" I asked.

""Yeah.""

""Why do you go through all of this online stuff then?""

""Oh, I'm just lazy, lol.""

...All year, this woman had been putting my fellow clients through hell with her technical issues. Her inability to operate the basic tools. Her short and rude nature with my fellow clients. I had only avoided her legendary wrath by pretending to be a doormat and quietly submitting to her demands. Only to find that all of this could have been avoided if she had decided to *walk the 200 yards from her dorm to the writing center?*

Seriously, the Freshmen dorms were *next door*. In fact, on certain days, we had a writing center *inside the freshmen dorms*. I know because *I worked there.* I wanted to scream. I wanted to run to this woman's dorm and strangle her with her stupid earbuds. 

But I didn't. I just smiled, and said. ""Oh, well... online appointments are really for students living off campus. You'll have a better experience if you come into the center. Plus, we can offer you more detailed tutoring in person.""

I think I said some other things to butter her up. I can't remember. Eventually, she caved and agreed to come in person next time. When the call ended, I dropped my headphones, walked into the break room, and stared at the wall for my entire break.

I really don't want to know what the people working there *now* have to deal with.

"Oh boy, that pesky password change...","I don't work in tech support, but any time something doesn't go according to plan for members of my family, I'm the guy to call.

I have quite a lot of stories, but this one is the most recent and by far the funniest. Even more so, coming from my 35yo girlfriend and not the usual suspect - my 70yo aunt.

&amp;nbsp;

To give you some background - at one time we both worked for large company which uses an open source app to store passwords. It's a piece of software that allows you to save your login details for specific sites, other apps, etc in a **local** encrypted ""database"". When you then browse a site for which you have a password set up you can just press a key combination and it will populate your user name, password and log you in. So there no chance of typos, you don't have to remember the passwords and google doesn't have them either.
We kinda liked it so we each use it at home as well.

I should also preface this by saying that my girlfriend gets quite nervous when it comes to handling finance over the internet and there's even a slight deviation from what she's used to.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, to the story...

&amp;nbsp;

Some time back google started informing users about potentially pwnd passwords. I received a bunch of notifications, my gf only a few. Back before the password app days she was in the habit of reusing passwords so I told her to change them, just so we're sure. Or at least the most important ones - the main email address and internet banking. She hesitantly agreed. She took out her laptop and lied down in bed, which is directly behind my pc setup (directly behind my back, I can't see her). I put on my headphones and continued coding and listening to a podcast.

&amp;nbsp;

After 15 minutes I hear a loud scream! Shocked, I throw down my headphones while simultaneously jerking around to see what was wrong. My gf was freaking out: ""OMG, what the hell?!! I can't log in to the bank. Omg, I don't even remember the code to reset my password over the phone. I'm screwed, I'm TOTALLY screwed.........."".

&amp;nbsp;

'Well, that's bad...', I thought. 'If her internet banking got compromised, sorting it out with the bank is going to be the most annoying thing ever...'. I managed to hide my slight nervousness and started asking questions...

&amp;nbsp;

Me: It's fine, we're gonna figure this out. Was the banking password in the pwnd list google gave you?

GF: No, it wasn't, but but but... I can't login, we're screwed... *angry sad scared face*

Me: Ok, what were you doing? Did you just go to your bank's page, tried to login with the password app and got an 'incorrect password' error message?

GF: YES!!!

(Well, she was using the app, so not a typo then...)

Me: When was the last time you were able to log in?

GF: Yesterday!!!

Me: Alright, we might have to call the bank, then. At least to see what's going on. Let me google the number...

(Well, that's not good... But since I know how stressed she can get, let me check again, just for my peace of mind...)

Me: Ok gf, breath in and out, in and out. Now, please, explain **EXACTLY** what you were doing. Step by step, click by click.

GF: Well, I changed my password and now I can't log in...

Me: That's fine, so just to restate what happened - you opened chrome, went to your bank's page, logged in, clicked 'change password', put it a new password, clicked 'save', clicked 'logout' and now you can't log back in using the new password?

(GF: a brief blank stare)

GF: ...no?

Me: Wait, what do you mean no?

GF: I didn't do it like that...

Me: Well, how did you do it then?

GF: Well, I opened the password app...

GF: edited the bank entry with a new password...

GF: pressed save... and now I can't log in..?

I want to save money but I dont want ink tank printer.,"Not so exciting story, but a very recent one. One of my clients wants to save as much money as possible when printing. Their printer just broke beyond repair point and they need a new one.

I spoke with the person in charge, they want a printer that has really cheap printing and toner/ink lasts at least 3500 pages. The best option for them is of course ink tank printer (they print about 3000 pages a month), so I recommended a few for them to choose from.

Their exact words were: ""I want to print as cheap as I can per page, I will let you recommend best option"", so I did.

Today, after waiting about 10 days they replied with: ""I don't want ink printer, I want laser printer, it is much cheaper to print with it"".

Of course, I did call them back right away to explain the difference between ink printers and ink tank printers, but the lady did not listen. She said ""My son is an IT student and he said, ink printers are expensive to print""

Now she has got in email inbox offer for laser printers. As you know, they are much more expensive to print, as higher maintenance costs, there is nothing else I can do for them. I wanted to save money for them, but I can see it is like mission impossible.

The student of IT has probably much more experiences as admin from IT company after many years in the job.

**Edit to avoid confusion:** ink printer and ink-tank printer are two different kinds of printers, both are inkjet, but in the ink-tank printer, you don't change cartridges, you just refill with ink (70ml-5000 pages for about 6€) and thats it.

"""Out of spec""","Today, I have a tale from a very analogue world for you.    
My roommate was the hero here, and he's a watchmaker.    
And a proud one at that.    
He has worked at different stores and in different countries, always putting his nose into fine mechanisms that cost as much as a car and get their operation smoothed by surfaces out of ruby and similar witchcraft.

Just a regular checkup, cleaning, demagnitizing adjustment, checking for precision...

Monday comes around and said owner is back, and he's PISSED.  
His fancy watch stopped working!    
So again it's laid out in front of my roommate, who has a terrible feeling, as se second-hand is visibly out of place, just held in by the glass.    
From inside the casing, he hears a curious plinking, that certainly shouldn't be there.    
He opens the back and it's carnage.     
The hefty pendulum that winds the watch while you walk? It's been ripped loose. Not just a loose screw, the arm it hung from had been broken.

It's not malfunctioning if you skip the animation.,"Hey, folks.

With COVID still a major issue in my jurisdiction, I haven't been able to satisfy my crippling Altoids addiction as well as I had been before April - and to make things worse, I had grabbed the wrong tin when I'd gone to the store yesterday. (Why they'd decided to make peppermint and cinnamon look so similar, I'll never know.)

I and $supervisor from the previous story were in the tech shop, shooting the breeze and relaxing between calls, when the radio earpiece crackled up with the sweet sound of... background noise. I'm pretty sure I heard a voice in there somewhere, before the channel went dead. It definitely wasn't an accidental key, since the assault on my ear lasted a solid ten seconds.

&gt; **$me:** ""Repeat that? All we got was background noise.""

The radio crackled back to life, and the quality of it wasn't much better, but at least they were talking *in the vicinity* of their microphone this time - it was enough for me to hear the location ""1-Foxtrot-2301"".

&gt; **$me:** ""You said 1-Fox-2301?""

&gt; **$radio with excessive background noise:** ""10-4.""

I stand up and stretch my legs a moment, and $supervisor and I walk out to the machine that bore the location plate reading *1-FF-2301*. That one was a game we'd recently converted into a 3-pack of linked games that ""shared"" a bonus, which linked all 3 upper screens together. Of note is that the ""shared bonus"" was on a timer as a sort of attract mode, rather than triggered via gameplay - it would appear at certain intervals, and players would have to get a certain combination on the payline to play this bonus mode. After a period of time elapsed in the shared bonus mode, the game would return to normal play, to repeat again a few minutes later.

This was my first shift back after the games had been converted, so I hadn't had the time to read the game rules before then. (Still haven't, actually.)

The attendant - Rebecca, one of the ones that would actually try to troubleshoot some issues before calling us - was there when we arrived. She explained the issue to me and $supervisor: The patron wasn't seeing the win tally at the end of the shared bonus, when the timer reached zero and returned to normal play. Rebecca had tried explaining that it wasn't like a free-games bonus where the win was tallied at the end, but the patron wouldn't accept the answer. Rebecca then checked that we didn't need her, and excused herself to handle other calls.

So, we watch the game. Soon enough, it goes into the shared bonus mode, and almost immediately I notice that it's a ""game within a game"" bonus, where the paytable is changed but wagering is still required to play (compared to a free games bonus, where the paytable is usually the same, but a wager is not required). And as the patron is playing, she's mashing the spin button like it was the ""fire"" button on a Galaga coin-op. Eventually, she gets awarded a ""trip"" to the shared bonus on the upper screens, and wins... a good chunk of money, actually.

And then we see the issue: as it was tallying at the end of the ""trip"", she began playing Galaga again with the spin button, skipping the tally animation on the upper screen.

Eventually, the timer ends, the game exits the shared bonus mode, and the patron is upset that the win didn't show up on the upper screen.

&gt; **$patron:** ""See? It didn't show the 'big win' with the little numbers!""

&gt; **$me:** ""It showed, you just skipped it. When you press the spin button, it'll skip the little numbers.""

&gt; **$patron:** ""But I didn't! It didn't show when the timer hit zero!""

&gt; **$me:** ""You weren't in the bonus when the timer hit zero. It tried to play right after you went in the bonus, but you pressed 'spin' and skipped it.""

&gt; **$patron:** ""Are you sure?""

&gt; **$me:** ""Yes, ma'am. We can wait for another bonus and show you, if you want.""

The patron nods, and eventually the five or so minutes passes before the shared bonus mode triggers again. A couple of spins into it, the patron gets another trip to the bonus. The bonus plays out, and I see her reach for the spin button.

&gt; **$me: ""Ma'am, no, wait. Don't press the button yet.""

The patron looks at me confused, and I gesture towards the screen, which reads ""BIG WIN"" with the numbers quickly counting up to a number I'd normally expect to see on my check stub. After a couple of seconds, the patron gives the 'Ohhhhhhh' of Understanding and thanks us.

It's BROKE!,"This one comes from the Bio-Medical Engineer at the hospital I work at. I'm sure all of you IT guys can relate.

The hospital has a maintenance department (for facilities and grounds and catch-all), and an IT department (for computers and networking), and a BioMed specialist (for FDA-regulated equipment that is used directly in the care of patients). He was always bitching about how nobody would use the ticketing system or even give him any useful information, and how maintenance and IT were constantly punting him extra work by claiming things are a BioMed issue when they clearly aren't. I like to fondly imagine his job eventually drove him to eat a gun, but in reality he just got fired for his bad attitude.

He comes in one morning to find a random vacuum cleaner on his desk. No note. Housekeeper just plopped it on his desk. He was apparently bored, so he replaced the frayed wire that was preventing the power switch from turning on the unit, rather than trying to argue with maintenance about whose job it actually is. 

At least one person (he never figured out who because they never signed their notes) would send IV pumps and other things down to his department, without the required BioMed Repair form being filled out, with a handwritten note taped to it with the cryptic all-caps Sharpie message ""IT'S BROKE!"" Then an unnecessarily lengthy troubleshooting process had to begin to even figure out what problem might need fixing (if any).

To try to cheer him up, I once sent him a BioMed request and even properly used the ticketing system, informing him ""It's BROKE!"" ...But he closed the ticket without comment.",669,0,1,"It's BROKE!

Shortcut Short Comings,"There is a real problem where I work with most users relying too much on shortcuts. They have shortcuts to servers and websites scattered all over their desktops. The first problem is that some don't even know how to make a shortcut (so IT has to make them for the users). But some are just totally lost without them.

Today I got a guy walking in my office (no helpdesk ticket and no phone call) saying that he cannot get to the timeclock website, but others can. I pull up the timeclock website and it is working for me as well. He goes back to his desk and I remote his machine (Social distancing and all) while he is on the phone with me. I open Chrome and type in the timeclock website into the address bar of the browser. It immediately goes to the proper timeclock website (which is basically only the domain name of the company - not referencing any id or script in the link or anything) and everything works perfectly. I tell him it appears to be working and he thanks me.

Five minutes later he calls back saying his old shortcut was broken and he made a new one (like this was a dramatic feat). The new one is working perfectly now.

Now the address is JUST the name of the company (for example [abctimeclock.com](https://abctimeclock#3.com)) so not sure how he could mess that up. (There is nothing extra, no reference to a script, ID number, hidden directory or app.) But the biggest problem here is that while he knows how to make a shortcut, he did not know how to type the domain name in the address bar to manually go to the website and had to rely solely on a shortcut to get him to a website he uses 4 times a day.",567,0,1,"Shortcut Short Comings There is a real problem where I work with most users relying too much on shortcuts.

It runs on what?,"Just happened today. The school district I work for has been handing out wifi hotspots to families without internet so the kids can use it for distance learning. Yeah it costs a fortune but it needs to be done especially in some of our poorer neighborhoods. We handed one out to a family and it worked great the first day. Second day it didn't work at all, so they brought it back.   
The Principal couldn't get it to work so he tracked me down and asked how to get it running.

I look at it and I don't see and green blinky lights. Always a bad sign. Then I see the box he's holding. Its the box the hotspot came in and it has all the device and cell vendor info on it. But thats not what interested me. I take the box from him. remove the cardboard insert. Unwrap from their original factory sealed wrappers the power block and power cord.

Plug it in to the wall and into the hotspot. The battery light blinks a bit then goes solid. A few seconds later the unit comes to life spewing out moderately secure wifi goodness.

I need this done before the board meeting in 10 min,"Background, I work at a MSP and one of our clients is a mid-sized manufacturing client. The boss of this client is someone who we will call ""Senile boss"" (SB) because he forgets things over and over and not just technical things. SB is known to call in and demand all sorts of things that are outside of our contract. Normally this isn't too bad, more helping him along as he appears to not understand how computers work and that's why we are there.

Me: Thank you for calling \[MSP\], how can I assist you?  
SB: Yeah, i need some assistance on this excel sheet I have to present to the board in 10 minutes.  
Me: OK let me get connected and you can show me whats going on

I get connected and find that this is a giant excel document with sheet upon sheet that reach references something else in a different sheet of the document. It is very well put together and shows a lot of P/L on raw materials and time. 

Me: Ok, I see the sheet here. What is the issue?  
SB:Yes, you see on the sheet marked ""lines"", I want to add another ""line"" so I can project the P/L of adding another assembly line. Do I just copy/paste the other ones?  
Me:Well no, you can do that but the cells will still reference the old locations, you will need to go though and reference the correct location in the previous line's location.   
SB:Can't you do this? I need this done before the board meeting!  
Me: Sorry but that is outside our purview and even if we did that as a courtesy it would probably take us more than 10 minutes.
