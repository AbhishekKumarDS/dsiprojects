TL;DR at bottom.\n\nTo start of my rant/story: I took a lateral promotion (in June) in my company to work from home as a call center agent, which was a great choice at the time with the whole pandemic going on. My job was simple enough, answer questions about our services and take roadside assistance calls to submit to our dispatchers. This was the first ever ""call center"" job I\'ve worked so I was not familiar with the ACW, AHT, and other lingo, or the amount of micromanagement that happens - but that\'s another story.\n\nThis story involves Me = myself, RD = rude dickhead customer, and MT = supervisor/management team\n\nMe: (classic phone greeting and introduction) ""What service can I help you with today?""\n\nRD: ""I need a tow NOW. And I need your tow truck driver to take me too or YOU need to pay for my taxi ride home.""\n\nMe: ""No problem sir, I can get a service call set up for you, but we still cannot take passengers at this time for your safety and the safety of our drivers. Are you in a safe location? (He pulled into a gas station so he was not in an unsafe situation.)\n\n....(me taking down his location and other details about his vehicle that he wants towed - it was steering aggressively and pretty unsafe to drive at this point)\n\nRD: ""That tow truck driver better take me!""\n\nMe: ""Unfortunately sir, as stated before and in our front line phone message, we cannot take any passengers at this time. If you have family or friends that can provide a ride to you that would be an option. Otherwise I can transfer you to a taxi company in the area.""\n\nRD: ""NO no no! All my family members are working, NO ONE can drive me and I\'m 1 hr from home!! Are you paying for my taxi, cuz I dont have the fucking money for that?!""\n\nMe: ""I can understand your frustration sir, unfortunately at this time [my company] is not paying for alternative transport. Are you okay waiting until a family or friend is available to drive you?""\n\nRD: ""I ALREADY TOLD YOU! NO ONE CAN DRIVE ME AND IM ONE HOUR FROM HOME!""\n\nMe: ""I\'m sorry about your situation sir, but the only thing I can do for you is transfer you to a taxi company in the area and speak to my dispatchers if there is a driver in the area that would be willing to take you in their vehicle.""\n\nRD: ""Yeah you do that! And you tell dispatch or whoever that if the driver won\'t take me, I\'m going to drive my car home and straight into the ditch!

TL;DR at bottom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To start of my rant/story: I took a lateral promotion (in June) in my company to work from home as a call center agent, which was a great choice at the time with the whole pandemic going on. My job was simple enough, answer questions about our services and take roadside assistance calls to submit to our dispatchers. This was the first ever &amp;quot;call center&amp;quot; job I&amp;#39;ve worked so I was not familiar with the ACW, AHT, and other lingo, or the amount of micromanagement that happens - but that&amp;#39;s another story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This story involves Me = myself, RD = rude dickhead customer, and MT = supervisor/management team&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: (classic phone greeting and introduction) &amp;quot;What service can I help you with today?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RD: &amp;quot;I need a tow NOW. And I need your tow truck driver to take me too or YOU need to pay for my taxi ride home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;No problem sir, I can get a service call set up for you, but we still cannot take passengers at this time for your safety and the safety of our drivers. Are you in a safe location? (He pulled into a gas station so he was not in an unsafe situation.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;....(me taking down his location and other details about his vehicle that he wants towed - it was steering aggressively and pretty unsafe to drive at this point)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RD: &amp;quot;That tow truck driver better take me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Unfortunately sir, as stated before and in our front line phone message, we cannot take any passengers at this time. If you have family or friends that can provide a ride to you that would be an option. Otherwise I can transfer you to a taxi company in the area.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RD: &amp;quot;NO no no! All my family members are working, NO ONE can drive me and I&amp;#39;m 1 hr from home!! Are you paying for my taxi, cuz I dont have the fucking money for that?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;I can understand your frustration sir, unfortunately at this time [my company] is not paying for alternative transport. Are you okay waiting until a family or friend is available to drive you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RD: &amp;quot;I ALREADY TOLD YOU! NO ONE CAN DRIVE ME AND IM ONE HOUR FROM HOME!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry about your situation sir, but the only thing I can do for you is transfer you to a taxi company in the area and speak to my dispatchers if there is a driver in the area that would be willing to take you in their vehicle.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RD: &amp;quot;Yeah you do that! And you tell dispatch or whoever that if the driver won&amp;#39;t take me, I&amp;#39;m going to drive my car home and straight into the ditch! AND I&amp;#39;LL SUE YOUR COMPANY FOR DAMAGES AND MY HOSPITAL BILLS!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Sir, I understand you are frustrated with your situation and being unable to get a ride.

They will give you credit for items directly when you buy products. Pretty sweet and super instant on your bill as long as you mail it in ASAP and don’t play the system.\n\nPlace B - Our stores, and technically where I work, but the stores and the call centers can’t touch each other’s stuff and anything you do in person at a store, we can’t see or help you with.\n\n\n\nI’ve worked tech support for my company variously for over six years and moved to a post sales position due to corona and the insane things people think is okay to do to their electronics. I still get crazy calls but I don’t have to share screens or sell anything so I’m peachy, and a little less stressed but the stupid and self entitled people do not make life any easier.\n\n\n\nSo today the angry lady calls in with the bankcard on the line with her. Okay. We don’t normally do things this way. She was super upset/mad because we took back a credit for a computer she did not trade in correctly yet “check the recorded calls you all said it would be fine.” (She turned it in at Place B and got instant credit instead of mailing it in to Place A like she was supposed to.) She started off at a pre-screech levels of half yelling into my ears and this progressively got louder as she huffed and complained and explained the situation. And also telling me to check prior calls is like asking a rock to roll over. Not happening. Can’t do it. I’m not management.\n\nThe store (Place B) gave her the credit and she applied it to her bank card and boom, she now has that instant credit for let’s say 100 dollars on top of the credit from Place A. Now the Place A she was supposed to mail her computer to charged her back for the money and the cost of the prepaid shipment box. $118.55. She’s livid and I offer her $20 to offset the shipping charge cause I’m nice. I’ll try to do a good thing. And she isn’t too bad yet.\n\nThe silence for ten seconds then it happens, she inhaled and I hadn’t braced myself.\n\nAL went ballistic on me, full Karen and asked for a manager. Screaming about everything. The callback time for a manager in MY department is 9 to 11 full days on a good week. This was explained thoroughly and she demanded I still try to call one now with her son egging her on in the background. Whatever. Let’s waste our time. I still get paid because you’re being rude.\n\nI do the whole call over to a manager, check in every two minutes, wait ten minutes in total, make huge notes and a callback request, come back and tell her what’s next.\n\nAL: “I WORK CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I KNOW HOW IT WORKS GO SEE IF YOU HAVE MANAGER NOW.”\n\nI check it’s at 15 minutes hold now for a manager and no ones there but waiting music, come back explain again they will call her back in 9 days and she flips again. I advise I can check one more time but then I have to release the call. She agrees.

They will give you credit for items directly when you buy products. Pretty sweet and super instant on your bill as long as you mail it in ASAP and don’t play the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Place B - Our stores, and technically where I work, but the stores and the call centers can’t touch each other’s stuff and anything you do in person at a store, we can’t see or help you with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked tech support for my company variously for over six years and moved to a post sales position due to corona and the insane things people think is okay to do to their electronics. I still get crazy calls but I don’t have to share screens or sell anything so I’m peachy, and a little less stressed but the stupid and self entitled people do not make life any easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So today the angry lady calls in with the bankcard on the line with her. Okay. We don’t normally do things this way. She was super upset/mad because we took back a credit for a computer she did not trade in correctly yet “check the recorded calls you all said it would be fine.” (She turned it in at Place B and got instant credit instead of mailing it in to Place A like she was supposed to.) She started off at a pre-screech levels of half yelling into my ears and this progressively got louder as she huffed and complained and explained the situation. And also telling me to check prior calls is like asking a rock to roll over. Not happening. Can’t do it. I’m not management.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The store (Place B) gave her the credit and she applied it to her bank card and boom, she now has that instant credit for let’s say 100 dollars on top of the credit from Place A. Now the Place A she was supposed to mail her computer to charged her back for the money and the cost of the prepaid shipment box. $118.55. She’s livid and I offer her $20 to offset the shipping charge cause I’m nice. I’ll try to do a good thing. And she isn’t too bad yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The silence for ten seconds then it happens, she inhaled and I hadn’t braced myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AL went ballistic on me, full Karen and asked for a manager. Screaming about everything. The callback time for a manager in MY department is 9 to 11 full days on a good week. This was explained thoroughly and she demanded I still try to call one now with her son egging her on in the background. Whatever. Let’s waste our time. I still get paid because you’re being rude.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I do the whole call over to a manager, check in every two minutes, wait ten minutes in total, make huge notes and a callback request, come back and tell her what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AL: “I WORK CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I KNOW HOW IT WORKS GO SEE IF YOU HAVE MANAGER NOW.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I check it’s at 15 minutes hold now for a manager and no ones there but waiting music, come back explain again they will call her back in 9 days and she flips again. I advise I can check one more time but then I have to release the call. She agrees. I check and come back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AL: “This is just not how you promote good customer service, why can I get a manager so much faster usually with you assholes?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me:  “Well usually when you call tech support you can get a manager in three to ten minutes depending on the day and the call volume.

After a few Pages of Not realy strange or help full Details I finaly found the evil thing that raised the Bill in this unbelivebel amount.\nLike so often it is one of the simples things that just didn't came in the Customers mind what brings them in Financial difficulties.

After i explain that he use a Function that is not in the booked service and also not get calculated in a low Status because of his location at the Time of useing which also means i can't answer the questions of what tariff the calculat based he explain to, that he just can't pay this Bill and ask me to find a Solutions.\nI try to calm him down and make sure that there is always a Solutions especialy when the contact Starts so close to the appearance of the Problem. While i do this already Start to Check what i needs to push a installment payment without Problems, the most things i head in my head all the Time but the list is very long and chance sometimes.\nAfter i figuerd out if there is a Chance to get this Solution, i opened it to the costomer and explain the one thing we have to Switch. \n\nIt was a realy simple and Quick to Change when ever hes ready and after the Bill is complitly payed. \nHe just had to give me the right to take back his termination for now. Also explain that he can reverse it after everything is done and payed.\n\nI startet the next Step already and just had to push the botton which connect  me with 2nd in the background while the customer listen to some fancy music till 2nd takes the Call and i can close the Case for  me.\n\nBut than the customer began to think about what happens when the contract stays. \nWith the Start of the first sentense from him I was close to think that he make a Bad joke with me.. But he realy ask me why he have to pay the Bill in steps every month and also have to pay the Contract. Befor i was able to Start an explain he contunue to ask me if this is realy the only offer i had for him, for him the so long customer. I answer that this is realy the only Chance  for we have to make the wight of the Bill softer and easyer to handle, so he had not to pay the whole big thing at once. I startet friendly and with the nicest voice i had to explain that there a no ways  to deleted the Bill in some way  because it wasn't the fault of our Firma. \nIts fact that we realy explain more than once while the Contract running what the Service has in and what does cost more and espacially things like his because there are other prices in other locations  we just didn't know or can Control  as long as the costumor books  a Option that are made for These Situations.\n\nBut it was to late.. my words didn't get to the costumor. And after he shoutet out how to the World how completely incompetent I am and obously my Firma he end  his explanaition about the way he see  us now he end with the words  that because of that he now cancel every Single Contract he has with us. \nAnd befor i had the Moment to make sure that he know that in this way he had to pay the whole Bill what could be bring him more in a Bad Situation with money as it could when he just had to pay the price of the Service for few months. And i promise, it was the smallest price you can get for a Service in our whole assortment.  \nThis Service to this prices didn't even exsist  anymore \nBut he cancel the Call and gave me no Change to bring him to a lower  level of angry so Yeah i think thats it.\n\nFor the Post  processing  i Check the System to See if there is anything to See already about the payment \nAnd yes money ist gone away while he prefers to shout at me for helping."", 'author_fullname': 't2_8o0xxp59', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': ""No Sir, I'm Sorry but I can't set your Bill to 0 because the big number you see has reach so high because you use a thing wich is clearly define on your Contract as expensiv and not free."", 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/talesfromcallcenters', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'long', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_k4p39w', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.65, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 15, 'total_awards_received': 1, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'L', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 15, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1606871382.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.talesfromcallcenters', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, i work at the Bill and Contract Department for a German Internet Provider.

For a while I worked for a MLM who I made feel bad for what they fully intended to do  to me and I was terminated in the kindest and most understanding way you can imagine before I found a job at a call center.\n\nIt was one of those places that sold overpriced tubs for seniors with lights and jets and I was upfront that I wasn't interested if there was no base pay which they assured me there was and so I was hired pretty much on the spot since the turnover rate at those places is notoriously high. As I was given the tour I noticed a pizza party in the break room and the smell of cheap coffee was strong but I thought nothing of it as they were mentioned as a benefit for employees.\n\nTraining was short and I really wanted to work hard to go from the cold call floor to the warm call floor. I was familiar with the program being used and didn't need any accommodations to do what I needed to do. The script was dry, we weren't really told much on how to encourage people to accept having a consultant in the house other than the usual and certainly we were told nothing about which healthcare programs may help support the cost of the merchandise.  I found out several things quickly.\n\nThe pizza was a lie. the supervisors started friendly 'competitions' for their teams so that during a one or two hour period the team that set up the most appointments would get a $5 Little Ceasars pizza to share in victory but for the 4 months I worked there the only pizza I saw was during my interview and apparently only because the entire floor badgered the supervisors to put up or shut up.\n\nCoffee was only served once a day strategically between agents breaks so that only the receptionists and Supervisors could get it but we all faked needing to pee to have some of the only good thing about this place. We had our own cups that we were suppose to keep in our lockers in the hall way outside the production floor but it was an unsaid rule for agents to sit with their empty cups between their legs until we smelled the coffee and then the race of management VS agents was on.\n\nThey disabled our ability to mark numbers that were on the DNC registry and set it up in the system so that instead of being removed from solicitations permanently, they were removed for only a month which constitutes as harassment in this state so over half the calls I took were irate senors who legitimately had a beef with the company and wanted the calls to stop.  I felt terribly for these people and came to recognize a few numbers on sight which I immediately marked DNC to save them slight hassle.\n\nUnhappy that some customers were locking the consultants out of the house after setting up appointments, management reduced bonuses from setting up any kind of appointment to only for confirmed appointments. They also tried to crack down on us getting coffee but one of the guys pissed at his station and said they couldn't restrict our right to use the bathrooms when needed. Gross, but effective. We weren't threatened for termination when we wanted to change feminine products or use the can. I guess the reduction of bonuses made sense but I never did figure out why they tried to restrict coffee as a management only privilege when they pointed it out as a benefit for all employees on site during interviews and training.\n\nInto my third month there things got weirder. Management tried to keep us from using the bathrooms on site and tried to say that we would have to walk or drive down the road to the gas station during our lunch or breaks as we were going to be locked out of the bathrooms on the first floor. That only the owners and managers were allowed to use the ones on the second floor after an incident involving a toilet paper roll being set on fire in the mens' room that no one owned up to. One of the gals brought up that this was a violation of  the law and that if they didn't want to have OSHA taking up residence in their butts they'd rethink this course of action.  The bathrooms were unlocked after a day.\n\nThere use to be a fridge we could put our lunches in though I never used it because of obligatory food thieves but apparently at this time Management was trying to cut costs where they could.  I never figured out if this part was true but I can't outright say it's a lie as I know some of my co workers did have green cards. Apparently a manager found drug paraphernalia in the back of the freezer and that lost us the privilege of using the fridge for our perishables. They taped the fridge shut with painters tape and unplugged it. The paraphernalia wasn't related to anything the green cards applied to so it was either a lie fabricated to justify cutting costs or someone was indeed being very dumb.\n\nInto the fourth month management or the owners had another grand idea, that we had to get a confirmed appointment every hour or we would be sent home despite us rehashing old number's and having harassed many of the people we called for months about trying to order overpriced equipment under the guise of senior aid.  The supervisors still tried to get us to play their games with the promise of cheap pizza but if we weren't impressed with their failure to deliver before we certainly were underwhelmed now that our pay was being impacted.\n\nI got sent home early for a week before I was finally ticked off at the BS at work I handed in my two week notice and counted the days as the floor 'supervisors' tried to whip the agents into a frenzy to schedule appointments. Every day they'd loose people on the floor and try to calling people from the evening shift to fill in for the gaping holes in the morning shifts, and then they'd expect the evening shift to come in for their scheduled times to work for presumably the same hourly requirement or they get sent home early as well.\n\nThree days from supreme happiness I looked at the schedule and saw that these sorry excuses for bosses had scheduled me and I went to HR to tell them that they'd have to revise this schedule as I wouldn't be in next week.

For a while I worked for a MLM who I made feel bad for what they fully intended to do  to me and I was terminated in the kindest and most understanding way you can imagine before I found a job at a call center.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was one of those places that sold overpriced tubs for seniors with lights and jets and I was upfront that I wasn&amp;#39;t interested if there was no base pay which they assured me there was and so I was hired pretty much on the spot since the turnover rate at those places is notoriously high. As I was given the tour I noticed a pizza party in the break room and the smell of cheap coffee was strong but I thought nothing of it as they were mentioned as a benefit for employees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Training was short and I really wanted to work hard to go from the cold call floor to the warm call floor. I was familiar with the program being used and didn&amp;#39;t need any accommodations to do what I needed to do. The script was dry, we weren&amp;#39;t really told much on how to encourage people to accept having a consultant in the house other than the usual and certainly we were told nothing about which healthcare programs may help support the cost of the merchandise.  I found out several things quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pizza was a lie. the supervisors started friendly &amp;#39;competitions&amp;#39; for their teams so that during a one or two hour period the team that set up the most appointments would get a $5 Little Ceasars pizza to share in victory but for the 4 months I worked there the only pizza I saw was during my interview and apparently only because the entire floor badgered the supervisors to put up or shut up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Coffee was only served once a day strategically between agents breaks so that only the receptionists and Supervisors could get it but we all faked needing to pee to have some of the only good thing about this place. We had our own cups that we were suppose to keep in our lockers in the hall way outside the production floor but it was an unsaid rule for agents to sit with their empty cups between their legs until we smelled the coffee and then the race of management VS agents was on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They disabled our ability to mark numbers that were on the DNC registry and set it up in the system so that instead of being removed from solicitations permanently, they were removed for only a month which constitutes as harassment in this state so over half the calls I took were irate senors who legitimately had a beef with the company and wanted the calls to stop.  I felt terribly for these people and came to recognize a few numbers on sight which I immediately marked DNC to save them slight hassle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unhappy that some customers were locking the consultants out of the house after setting up appointments, management reduced bonuses from setting up any kind of appointment to only for confirmed appointments. They also tried to crack down on us getting coffee but one of the guys pissed at his station and said they couldn&amp;#39;t restrict our right to use the bathrooms when needed. Gross, but effective. We weren&amp;#39;t threatened for termination when we wanted to change feminine products or use the can. I guess the reduction of bonuses made sense but I never did figure out why they tried to restrict coffee as a management only privilege when they pointed it out as a benefit for all employees on site during interviews and training.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Into my third month there things got weirder. Management tried to keep us from using the bathrooms on site and tried to say that we would have to walk or drive down the road to the gas station during our lunch or breaks as we were going to be locked out of the bathrooms on the first floor. That only the owners and managers were allowed to use the ones on the second floor after an incident involving a toilet paper roll being set on fire in the mens&amp;#39; room that no one owned up to. One of the gals brought up that this was a violation of  the law and that if they didn&amp;#39;t want to have OSHA taking up residence in their butts they&amp;#39;d rethink this course of action.  The bathrooms were unlocked after a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There use to be a fridge we could put our lunches in though I never used it because of obligatory food thieves but apparently at this time Management was trying to cut costs where they could.  I never figured out if this part was true but I can&amp;#39;t outright say it&amp;#39;s a lie as I know some of my co workers did have green cards. Apparently a manager found drug paraphernalia in the back of the freezer and that lost us the privilege of using the fridge for our perishables. They taped the fridge shut with painters tape and unplugged it. The paraphernalia wasn&amp;#39;t related to anything the green cards applied to so it was either a lie fabricated to justify cutting costs or someone was indeed being very dumb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Into the fourth month management or the owners had another grand idea, that we had to get a confirmed appointment every hour or we would be sent home despite us rehashing old number&amp;#39;s and having harassed many of the people we called for months about trying to order overpriced equipment under the guise of senior aid.  The supervisors still tried to get us to play their games with the promise of cheap pizza but if we weren&amp;#39;t impressed with their failure to deliver before we certainly were underwhelmed now that our pay was being impacted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got sent home early for a week before I was finally ticked off at the BS at work I handed in my two week notice and counted the days as the floor &amp;#39;supervisors&amp;#39; tried to whip the agents into a frenzy to schedule appointments. Every day they&amp;#39;d loose people on the floor and try to calling people from the evening shift to fill in for the gaping holes in the morning shifts, and then they&amp;#39;d expect the evening shift to come in for their scheduled times to work for presumably the same hourly requirement or they get sent home early as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three days from supreme happiness I looked at the schedule and saw that these sorry excuses for bosses had scheduled me and I went to HR to tell them that they&amp;#39;d have to revise this schedule as I wouldn&amp;#39;t be in next week. When they tried to explain that I hadn&amp;#39;t worked long enough to get FMLA I told them that I&amp;#39;d turned in my two weeks notice and I wasn&amp;#39;t going to be in, ever, after this week. The flaccid toad&amp;#39;s mouth gaped like a fish as I turned and went back to my station for another hour until I was sent home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After I left I didn&amp;#39;t even wait before I got back into the job hunt but I did text a few of my workmates and months later I ran into one who shared the ultimate fate of that place.

The best way I can describe Kevin is a whiny, bratty, impatient child who never learned how to communicate well, if at all. He has been with us for what will be 2 years in December if I remember correctly, and continues to call in asking questions that your average person who had just signed a contract would have learned within the first month of owning the software. \n\nA few things to note about Kevin:\n\n* We have a full fucking suite of help articles, videos, tutorials, larger-scale walkthroughs, and one on one thirty minute training classes you can schedule in advance with a member of the team who handles all of the above. Kevin will not lay eyes on a single written word or a single video. He insists on having his hand held through *everything*. Which is fine, but there are some topics that are definitely more easily read with screenshots/watched on a video than talked through. There\'s also the fact that he\'s completely SOL on the weekends when we\'re closed since he actively refuses to read anything.\n* Kevin is very, very easily riled up/frustrated, and extremely impatient. He demands an explanation and then cuts you off as you try to explain because he\'s literally too impatient to hear the answer to his question. He will demand a quick explanation for something when a ""quick"" explanation may not always be possible. At that point, if you try to dumb it down, you cut out vital parts that would actually help him understand the answer, so he\'s going to be frustrated. If you try to explain more comprehensively, he will cut you off and still be frustrated.\n*  He has a very....fragmented knowledge about the system he purchased. An ""approximate knowledge of many things"", as I\'d like to call it. He also tends to call in multiple times to have the same things explained to him.\n\nTo explain how Kevin asks questions and expects them to be answered, here\'s a small hypothetical example about how his calls typically go:\n\n&gt;Kevin: I don\'t understand why the sky is blue. Can you tell me why the sky is blue?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You: Well, there\'s a bunch of gases and particles in the Earth\'s atmosphere that scatter the sunlight-  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Kevin: No, no, no, I don\'t care about all that, what\'s an atmosphere? Why do I need to care about gases and particles? I just asked you why the sky is blue, can\'t you explain that to me, just really quick?\n\nI think Kevin may have some form of ADHD, because his thought patterns and way of attempting to comprehend things feels WAY too close to the way I felt before learning to manage the symptoms and get medicated (I am not trying to diagnose him, just saying things are eerily similar). \n\nThe problem is that because he\'s so easily frustrated and stays frustrated for so long, and also tends to whine a LOT, it\'s hard to really meet in the middle with him. Talking to him feels as much like talking to a brick wall as some of our other hotheads, but with him, I feel like there\'s a thread we\'re missing to communicate with him that he\'s either not letting us find, or *can\'t* give us.', 'author_fullname': 't2_clxay', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Regular customer that no one has a clue how to talk to.', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/talesfromcallcenters', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'medium', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_k3or9b', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 22, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'M', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 22, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1606739311.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.talesfromcallcenters', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech support for a CRM (Customer Resource Management) software that clients use to organize and communicate with their customers through the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of our regular clients is Kevin.

Gonna drink myself to sleep tonight, but before that I\'ll share these two tales.\n\nH: HenriquesDumbCousin\nC1: First customer\n\nSo before transferring me the customer, the agent who received the call explained me the situation: Customer wants to make a one day reservation both pick up and drop off at the Sacramento International Airport.\n\nWhen booking a reservation, you have two options: pay at the counter and pay in advance. If you pay in advance, you get a better rate. The customer was requesting a supervisor because she wanted to pay at the counter, but get the prepay rate, which in my opinion is an idiotic request. Whatever, I\'ll set the record straight and move on.\n\nC1: They told me that if I pay in advance the rate will be 38 USD, and if I pay at the counter it\'ll be 41 USD, but I never pay in advance, can you do something about it?\n\nH: I do apologize for the inconvenience ma\'am, but it\'s not possible to give you the prepay rate if you don\'t pay in advance.\n\nC1: Don\'t you have a discount or a coupon?\n\nH: No ma\'am, I don\'t have any coupons available and I don\'t see any specials right now.\n\nC1: What\'s the base rate you have?\n\nH: 23.99 USD\n\nC1: Why is that? I\'m on your website and it shows 22 USD.\n\nH: It is possible that the website has its own special right now. I know it\'s weird, but even though we\'re the same company, sometimes the website has better rates than my department...\n\nC1: What about that wholesale food company that sells those bigass slices of pizza (not what she actually said, she just mentioned the name of the wholesale food company), I have a membership, don\'t you guys offer a discount for that?\n\nOh God... she\'s a member of that Company... I\'ve had some **really bad experiences** with them. \n\nH: Yes, we do have a partnership with them. \n\nC1: How can I apply the discount? I don\'t see any options on the website.\n\nThis call was taking longer than expected...\n\nH: I\'d strongly recommend you go to their website, specifically Wholesale Food Company that sells those bigass slices of pizza Travel dot com.\n\nC1: Why would I need to do that? Why can\'t I do it on your website?\n\nGuess I won\'t get rid of her anytime soon, might as well just make her a reservation and move on.\n\nH: That\'s okay, I\'ll add the discount myself, can you please provide me your membership number?\n\nShe provides me her membership number...\n\nH: Very well, with unlimited miles, taxes and fees included and your discount, it will be 38 USD...\n\nC1: Pay at the counter?\n\nH: Pay at the counter...\n\nI\'ll admit, that felt wholesome.\n\nSo I\'m just asking her for basic information like her e-mail, phone number, we even laughed at one point, then...\n\nC1: And this is for a Ford Fusion car, right?\n\nGoddammit...\n\nH: No ma\'am, this is for an Intermediate size vehicle like a Corolla or Chevy Cruze.\n\nC1: What? No, I told the agent that I wanted a Full Size car like a Ford Fusion.\n\nI check to see the rate for a Full Size car, and much to my dismay...\n\nH: A Full Size vehicle would be 42 USD\n\nC1: Don\'t you have like an upgrade coupon?\n\nI check, but I couldn\'t find an upgrade coupon, not that it would help, if I attached that type of coupon she would get a Standard Size vehicle anyways, not a Full Size.\n\nH: I\'m truly sorry ma\'am, but this is the best rate I can offer. Should I proceed with the reservation?\n\nC1: Pffft... No. So you\'re willing to lose a customer just for 3 dollars?\n\nH: I can\'t go any lower, sorry.\n\nC1: Guess I\'ll have to go with another company, I won\'t rent from you guys anymore.\n\nH: So be it, sorry to hear that.\n\nC1: Wait... did you just say ""so be it""?\n\nH: ... Yeah?\n\nC1: Tcht, such great customer service you have.\n\nThen I can hear her in the background ""can you believe this? He just told me ""so be it"".\n\n*Click*\n\nNearly 10 minutes trying to assist this bitch just for her to tell me ""are you willing to lose a customer just for 3 dollars?"". Don\'t like the rate? Feel free to shop around. Such a novelty concept, which leads to the following story where I had to deal with this asshole:\n\nH: HenriquesDumbCousin\nC2: Second customer\n\nC2: Hey HenriquesDumbCousin, so I just made a Reservation at the Hard Rock Hotel and I liked the rate (it was like 200 USD), but then I realized that I made the Reservation wrong. I selected both pick up and drop off at the Hard Rock Hotel, but I need to return the vehicle at the Orlando International Airport.\n\nH: Uh-huh...\n\nC2: But when I tried to fix my mistake, the rate of the Reservation increased 200 USD more! What\'s up with that?\n\nH: I do apologize for that, sir. Most of the time round trips are cheaper when compared to one way rentals.\n\nC2: But Hard Rock and Orlando International are very close!\n\nH: If that\'s the case, in order to avoid any issues, I\'d strongly recommend you return the vehicle at Hard Rock and take a Taxi or an Uber to Orlando International.\n\nC2: No, no, you don\'t understand, I don\'t want to return the vehicle at Hard Rock, I want to drop it at Orlando International.\n\nH: I\'m truly sorry sir, but there\'s nothing I can do.\n\nC2: But it\'s not even a one way rental, I mean, I\'m dropping the vehicle in the same city.\n\nH: But you\'re dropping it in a different location.\n\nCustomer continues to request that we do something for him.\n\nC2: There has to be something you can do for me HenriquesDumbCousin. \n\nH: My hands are tied, sir. That\'s the best rate we have for you, if you don\'t like that rate I\'d strongly recommend you shop around.\n\n*Awkward silence*\n\nC2: What... what did you just say to me?\n\nH: Ummm... you\'re welcome to shop around? I mean, you may find a better rate with another company.\n\nC2: Are you even allowed to say that? \n\nH: Pardon me?\n\nC2: HenriquesDumbCousin, I need to speak with a higher up, who do you answer to?\n\nFor fuck\'s sake.\n\nH: I can\'t share that person\'s information and he doesn\'t take any calls. Sir, I\'m sorry, but this is the best rate we can offer, if you don\'t like it we won\'t force you to pay for it, this is America after all.\n\nC2: ""This is America""? So now you\'re mocking me.\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with this guy?\n\nC2: You think I wouldn\'t know that? Of course I can go with another company, you think I haven\'t thought about that? Let me tell you, HenriquesDumbCousin, I own several businesses...\n\nH: Not impressive...\n\nC2: AND IF YOU WERE ONE OF MY EMPLOYEES...\n\nH: NOT IMPRESSIVE!!!\n\n*Click*\n\nH: Asshole...\n\nI\'d do a FAQ, but I think I already established that rates are not up to the agent.

He just told me &amp;quot;so be it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nearly 10 minutes trying to assist this bitch just for her to tell me &amp;quot;are you willing to lose a customer just for 3 dollars?&amp;quot;. Don&amp;#39;t like the rate? Feel free to shop around. Such a novelty concept, which leads to the following story where I had to deal with this asshole:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: HenriquesDumbCousin\nC2: Second customer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C2: Hey HenriquesDumbCousin, so I just made a Reservation at the Hard Rock Hotel and I liked the rate (it was like 200 USD), but then I realized that I made the Reservation wrong. I selected both pick up and drop off at the Hard Rock Hotel, but I need to return the vehicle at the Orlando International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: Uh-huh...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C2: But when I tried to fix my mistake, the rate of the Reservation increased 200 USD more! What&amp;#39;s up with that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: I do apologize for that, sir. Most of the time round trips are cheaper when compared to one way rentals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C2: But Hard Rock and Orlando International are very close!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: If that&amp;#39;s the case, in order to avoid any issues, I&amp;#39;d strongly recommend you return the vehicle at Hard Rock and take a Taxi or an Uber to Orlando International.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C2: No, no, you don&amp;#39;t understand, I don&amp;#39;t want to return the vehicle at Hard Rock, I want to drop it at Orlando International.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: I&amp;#39;m truly sorry sir, but there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C2: But it&amp;#39;s not even a one way rental, I mean, I&amp;#39;m dropping the vehicle in the same city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: But you&amp;#39;re dropping it in a different location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customer continues to request that we do something for him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C2: There has to be something you can do for me HenriquesDumbCousin. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: My hands are tied, sir. That&amp;#39;s the best rate we have for you, if you don&amp;#39;t like that rate I&amp;#39;d strongly recommend you shop around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Awkward silence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C2: What... what did you just say to me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: Ummm... you&amp;#39;re welcome to shop around? I mean, you may find a better rate with another company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C2: Are you even allowed to say that? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: Pardon me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C2: HenriquesDumbCousin, I need to speak with a higher up, who do you answer to?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For fuck&amp;#39;s sake.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: I can&amp;#39;t share that person&amp;#39;s information and he doesn&amp;#39;t take any calls. Sir, I&amp;#39;m sorry, but this is the best rate we can offer, if you don&amp;#39;t like it we won&amp;#39;t force you to pay for it, this is America after all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C2: &amp;quot;This is America&amp;quot;? So now you&amp;#39;re mocking me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the fuck is wrong with this guy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C2: You think I wouldn&amp;#39;t know that? Of course I can go with another company, you think I haven&amp;#39;t thought about that? Let me tell you, HenriquesDumbCousin, I own several businesses...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: Not impressive...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C2: AND IF YOU WERE ONE OF MY EMPLOYEES...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: NOT IMPRESSIVE!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;H: Asshole...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d do a FAQ, but I think I already established that rates are not up to the agent. Don&amp;#39;t like the rate, you&amp;#39;re more than welcome to shop around, if you don&amp;#39;t find anything better, we&amp;#39;ll be here for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': None, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 150, 'id': 'award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82', 'penny_donate': None, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'coin_reward': 0, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png', 'days_of_premium': 0, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5662dfbdb402bf67866c050aa76c31c147c2f45', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6882eb3f380e8e88009789f4d0072e17b8c59f1', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e50064b090879e8a0b55e433f6ee61d5cb5fbe1d', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5bb2e76683cb6b161830bcdd9642049d6adc11', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eda4a9246f95f42ee6940cc0ec65306fd20de878', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 2048, 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'description': 'Thank you stranger.

So it was only a matter time before one of my smoker coworkers  met up with a smoker cop &amp;amp; found out that Charles Smith was arrested for identity theft &amp;amp; his kids were the victims.  Small town local gossip puts it at over $250,000 dollars worth of charges on cards opened in the kids&amp;#39; names.  Not sure if that is true &amp;amp; his only mention in the news was under the &amp;quot;Arrests this Week&amp;quot; column, for fraud.  We&amp;#39;re all interested to see how it plays out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL:DR  Parent steals kids&amp;#39; identity, commits fraud, eventually is found out &amp;amp; arrested when he doesn&amp;#39;t pay his internet bill.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': None, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 100, 'id': 'gid_1', 'penny_donate': None, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'coin_reward': 0, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png', 'days_of_premium': 0, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 512, 'static_icon_width': 512, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'description': ""Shows the Silver Award... and that's it."", 'end_date': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'static_icon_height': 512, 'name': 'Silver', 'resized_static_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 512, 'penny_price': None, 'award_type': 'global', 'static_icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png'}], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2urem', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'k0872r', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'Im_not_the_assistant', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 67, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/k0872r/accidentally_exposed_a_family_fraud/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/k0872r/accidentally_exposed_a_family_fraud/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 208602, 'created_utc': 1606235267.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'talesfromcallcenters', 'selftext': 'So this was back in April after I first started working from home.\n\nWe were given new headsets with a mute button on for silent holds which I used pretty frequently to either bitch about my customers or just cough/sneeze.

This bank finances auto loans. So most of our calls pertain to car payments or our website.\n\nHad a lady call in earlier today. We can call her Karen for obvious reasons. As she calls in, an account pops up with a male name attached. I learn quickly that its her sons car and loan. He had previously called in at the beginning of this month to permanently authorize her on the account. Meaning I have permission to speak with her.\n\nShe calls in, I do my standard greeting. I\'m cut off about half way through with ""Yeah, yeah, I know. The call is recorded. I\'ve heard it before. I\'ve been on hold forever and we need to fix something right now."" Great. This should be fun.\n\nI glance over the account quickly while she\'s verifying the information. I notice the account is only a few months old and there\'s already a late payment marked on the account. Meaning a payment went over a month past due so we reported it as late to the credit bureaus. Sure enough, after verifying the account she hits me with the old ""We made a payment on time and your company screwed up and now its affecting my sons credit and he\'s trying to buy a house and he can\'t now blah blah blah"". Its very common for customers to blame us when a payment is late. They think we don\'t keep records of our calls. I don\'t know.\n\nSo this lady claims that her son called in a week before his first payment was even due. He made a payment using his checking account. She claims we must have taken down the numbers wrong because the payment never came out. A month goes by and thats when they realize the account was behind. They get it caught up but its too late. The damage is done. She wants that credit mark removed since we messed up.\n\nNow, even if that entire story were true and we took down the numbers wrong, the chances of us doing anything about the credit mark are slim. For multiple reasons. But I decide to humor her a bit. I tell her that I\'ll pull the call from that day, review it, and if she\'s correct and we took the information down wrong, I can pass along the account. I made sure to mention that even if that was the case, I can\'t promise anything.\n\nSo I pull the call and listen. And boy oh boy.\n\nTo start, it wasn\'t even the son (the account holder) calling in. It was VERY CLEARLY the same woman I had just spoken with. However this was BEFORE her son had authorized us to speak with her. So she lied about who she was and claimed to be the son. The son has a gender neutral name and the mom was able to verify his birthday/social, so that representative believed her. But regardless, she lied about her identity. That\'s considered fraud. Strike one.\n\nSecondly, she did not call in early. The account was actually over a week behind. On its first payment. And it was made clear to her within the first 30 seconds of the call. The representative specifically told her it was a week behind and asked why that was the case. The mother claimed something about COVID. So she lied again about when she tried to make the payment. Strike two.\n\nThird, during the processing of the payment, the representative specifically read back both the routing number and the account number for the checking account. The mom confirmed the information was correct. So her main claim about us taking the information down incorrectly was also a lie. She GAVE us the wrong information. Strike three.\n\nOn top of all of that, we called her sons phone every day and left messages. We sent bills stating the account was past due. The son had the account registered online and never bothered to log in to check that his first payment went through. And they clearly never checked the bank account to make sure the payment had come out. This is literally 100% on them. \n\nI had the pleasure of calling the woman back to inform her the waiver request was denied. That call may be good for a separate post. But she did not take it kindly and demanded to speak with the manager that listened to the call. Imagine her shock when I let her know that I had listened to the call myself.\n\nTl;dr don\'t let anyone else manage bills that are technically your responsibility. This guys credit is now hit pretty hard because he left it in the hands of his mother. Try not to feel bad for him. He\'s in his mid to late 20s and should be handling his own finances. Especially if he IS trying to buy a house. Which is hard to believe considering Karen lied about everything else.\n\nEDIT: For those asking, the son definitely knew about the loan.

I also really enjoy my job and feeling like I’ve helped someone with their issue. \n\nThat said, there are still some calls where I’d love to just hang up but I’ve never done it (with the exception of once. 30 seconds into a call a guy said he was gonna cum on my face; wtf?) \n\nWhere I work we have been told if we are put in an abusive situation we must warn the customer prior to terminating and give them a chance to cool down. \n\nI have had to give the “hey, I’d like to keep this call professional” warning a few times before and it works wonders. \n\nI didn’t today. No warning. Just hung up. \n\nFor some background, our bank is strict about certain fee waivers. There are fees that we are not able to waive at all, even if we tried. There is literally no button for it- if we think it’s a bank error we can send a notice to a much higher up supervisor. But it has to be a serious situation or we will get in trouble when they ask *my* supervisor why we are requesting them for fee waivers. \n\nI had a guy call in and immediately hit me with a bunch of questions, some of them, I wasn’t even able to answer because it was outside of my realm of expertise or I legally could not because he was asking sensitive info about his banking relationship and I did not have access to that. It was outside the realm of what a customer service rep normally would have access to. It would be like asking your pizza delivery driver for legal and tax advice and then asking him to solve a complicated calculus equation and recite a Shakespearean soliloquy from heart. \n\nI tried to calm him down and explain what I knew. “Sir, you’re behind on your payment because there was a balance due on [due date]). I do not have access to that other information as I am a customer service rep but in typical situations here is how it goes...”\n\nHe let the difficult questions go at that point. What was important was that it wasn’t his fault that he was late on his payment so I need to waive fees.\n\n“Sir, we sent a statement by mail stating this payment was due by [due date].” I said. \n\nWell, we promised him by phone he didn’t have to pay. \n\n“I’m very sorry we misinformed you, sir, but we sent this in writing that a payment was due.” \n\nWell, he tried to pay by phone but we were closed. So I need to waive fees. \n\n“I apologize sir, but we do not waive fees. (Don’t agree with it, but it’s not my company) Sir, I do not know why you were misinformed and can’t comprehend why that happened and I apologize. I show that we sent a statement by mail a month ago stating a payment was due.” \n\nThe man starts acting belligerent and I hear him and a woman yelling at each other and talking trash about me like I was not there and couldn’t hear it. He said I told him to “pay now or I’ll report him to the credit bureaus” (I said no such thing, never even implied this), that I “can’t see anything and can’t help” and essentially just seemed to craft a narrative about how I was refusing to help when it was completely opposite. He just didn’t want to accept the help and wanted to be a victim. \n\nHe then starts handing the phone to random people. Every time a new person comes on the line (including being put on speaker phone) we have to warn that the call is being recorded (for legal reasons in some states) and ask who I’m speaking with. If I am not speaking with someone not on the file, I can’t release any info. \n\nWoman (call her Anne) is put on the phone and states her full name after I state the recording blurb. \n\n“I’m Anne Doe, look we really just need these fees waived. Can you please just waive them because I want to finish cleaning, please just waive them.” \n\nThis call is already going south and I feel uncomfortable as I’ve already said no. On top of that, the customer constantly switching the phone between people is confusing, so I figure maybe I will see if there are any type of fees I can credit back that will please them. \n\nI ask Anne to wait a second and let me look. \n\nThere are no fees I can credit back. \n\n“Anne, I’m sorry about the wait. I can’t waive any fees. It does not allow me to, our bank does not waive these fees.” \n\n“So you can’t waive the fees?”\n\n“No, I’m sorry.” \n\nAnne puts me on speaker phone and goes ballistic. “TELL ME WHY! TELL ME WHY!” She begins shrieking. \n\n“Okay, wait just a moment.” At this point, I raise my voice and become firm. “I need to know everyone I’m speaking with.” I read the disclosure about recording. \n\n“No!” Anne shrieks. “You can’t answer my question! Answer it! What is wrong with you?! Is something the matter with you? Just do your job!” \n\nShe is going absolutely nuts and my blood starts boiling. I knew raising my voice was a mistake, but her behavior completely caught me off guard. Perhaps there was a better way to handle it but I was stunned with how quickly her behavior had changed. \n\n“Ma’am, I need to know who I’m speaking with before I proceed. Who all is in the room?”\n\n“You know who it is and you’re avoiding my question!” Anne was completely belligerent and shouting insults into the phone. And then. She *mocked* me. “Hello? Hello? You gonna pretend to hang up? This call may be monitored or recorded. Hello? Hello?” She sounded like an 8 year old. \n\nI went silent, kind of froze. I had no idea what to say or do. I didn’t even want to give this person the chance to play nice. I let her scream at and mock me for about 30 seconds and then just... *click*. I was thinking.. what do I say to move this conversation forward? Do I jump in and give another opportunity to this person to attempt to bully and gaslight me? I just didn’t want to put up with it, consequences be damned. \n\nAdmittedly, I don’t remember if she said anything extremely awful. I just remember the belligerent, sometimes incoherent screaming and lastly I think that the “what’s wrong with you” thing really bothered me because I have been a victim of gaslighting like this before. Made to feel like I was completely crazy for something that was unproblematic and a reasonable boundary for me to set. It definitely triggered something in me and I didn’t want to continue to take this. \n\nHere’s the kicker. You know how much the fees were? \n\nIt was for a single dollar. This woman and man had gone ballistic over having to pay a dollar after not paying the balance owed for *multiple* months. 🤔 \n\nUnless I’m given a reason otherwise, I believe what the customer says. One of our reps screwed up. They didn’t get their statement. They were freaked out about the bill because they’ve never used a bank product and was scared to call. Whatever. \n\nBut in this instance this guy had already called us multiple times to complain and was behind multiple months. On top of that, he actually was granted a fee waiver 6 months prior when the same thing happened. He seemed to use credit, carry a balance and not pay. Decide to pay after multiple missed payments, and then raise hell with our reps to get out of the consequences that come after not paying your bill on time. \n\n\nSo yeah.

We went from having approximately 100 pieces of exercise equipment per cargo ship to only 50. Because of quarantines, demand has also skyrocketed so there’s very few pieces of equipment to go around. Warehouses are also having to close because of staffing issues related to Covid so that’s pushing delivery dates even further back.\n\nAll day I get berated by customers for not being able to give them their overpriced exercise equipment right at this second. Most customers are on the wealthier end and expect instant gratification immediately despite the fact we are in a pandemic and I cannot help beyond being a communication bridge between our customers and delivery partners. Some of our wait times are 3 months or longer because of all these factors.

Specifically, I take calls for a very popular upscale exercise equipment brand. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Due to Covid-19, ports are slowed down exponentially so there’s a shortage of inventory in the continental US. We went from having approximately 100 pieces of exercise equipment per cargo ship to only 50. Because of quarantines, demand has also skyrocketed so there’s very few pieces of equipment to go around. Warehouses are also having to close because of staffing issues related to Covid so that’s pushing delivery dates even further back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All day I get berated by customers for not being able to give them their overpriced exercise equipment right at this second. Most customers are on the wealthier end and expect instant gratification immediately despite the fact we are in a pandemic and I cannot help beyond being a communication bridge between our customers and delivery partners. Some of our wait times are 3 months or longer because of all these factors.

This is a problem HenriquesDumbCousin, the person I spoke with yesterday, I think she told me she was from India, she told me that I could extend the rental for 29 more days! I already made plans, this is a big inconvenience!\n\nI honestly doubt the customer is being honest here. I suspect he  just called and asked how long could a rental be without sharing more information. The agent, not knowing that it was an active reservation, told him that they can be up to 59 days and that\'s it. Otherwise, why did the customer didn\'t extend the reservation at that precise moment? \n\nRegardless, it was his own fuck up, he waited until the reservation was nearly over to extend it for another month, not to mention if it was such an inconvenience to close the current contract and get a new one at the location, that means he acted before consulting us in the first place.\n\nH: I would strongly recommend to return the vehicle to the location, close your current contract and get a new one, sir.\n\nC: ...

There was a call on our hold garage (the garage we send calls to when it requires us to actually read the notes or when it\'s not ready to be sent to a garage yet) I was looking at the notes to see what was going on with it and saw that one of our garages was already out there and wouldn\'t tow it because it didn\'t have plates. It\'s against company policy to tow a vehicle without plates.

He started off nice but that was just a front I guess. I was trying to explain why we wouldn\'t tow it but he wouldn\'t let me talk. He kept talking about how he just bought it and it broke down when he was driving it home, the old owner has a lien on it that he has to pay off before the member was able to get it in his name, per the governor, he had until December 1st to transfer plates from his good vehicle to this vehicle, he used to be a dispatcher for some company so he knows the law and just going on and on about all that I listed above. He kept telling me to go to some website because it said on there he had until December 1st. \n\nJust overall being rude by talking over me and not letting me explain anything. Because the thing is....it doesn\'t matter what the law was saying...this had to do with our policy\'s and not anything to do with the law. Which I tried explaining to him. \n\nNow something you should know about me is I rarely hang up on customers when they\'re being abusive. I think I\'ve become desensitized to it and it doesn\'t bother me. Also, I try to avoid interrupting customers and let them say what it is that they want to say. This guy got so bad though and I knew it wasn\'t going anyways so I had no choice but to talk over him. He still wouldn\'t listen. I think this is when he realized that I wasn\'t going to go down without a fight so it devolved into craziness. \n\nHe started asking me if I was a republican, or democratic, which I shut down right away and reminded him it had nothing to do with his call. He then went off on some tangent about how all the garages in that area are gun wielding white supremacist and a bunch of other bull that I wasn\'t really listening to. \n\nIt turned into an argument between him and I because during all this he kept flip flopping and saying that the vehicle has good plates, the tags aren\'t expired and then would turn around and say it doesn\'t have plates. Finally, I realized that he meant his GOOD vehicle had good plates and he was going to take the plates from his good vehicle and put them on the bad vehicle and he felt he was allowed because the governor said he had until December 1st to get it transferred. Um no. Not how that works. Even if that was allowed, it\'s still against our policy. We won\'t touch a vehicle that we know has the plates for another vehicle. \n\nNow remember how I said that I can handle being cussed at and called names? Yeah well my kryptonite is when someone is condescending to me. That\'s a quick way to piss me off. \n\nWell after, he realized that I wasn\'t giving up he started talking to me like a child and started saying things like ""listen here little girl"" or ""now little girl...."" and that was my boiling point.

An important thing to note is that the client has 4 companies, but my site mostly provides service to 3 of them. The 4th is managed mostly by the client itself in Canada and the little support we provide is mostly by our tier 2 agents, a.k.a., the experts. The fourth company\'s name is SCI, by the way.

On top of that, the ticketing system we\'re supposed to use wasn\'t working for me because I couldn\'t find the users with the employee ID they\'d give me.\n\nAfter 4 hours I was about to give up. I was panicking because the calls were harder than I thought and I was way over my head. Whose bright idea was it to take this job when I\'m not tech savvy? I was also worried because the training had been done remotely and maybe I\'d missed something important.

An important thing to note is that the client has 4 companies, but my site mostly provides service to 3 of them.

(Thankfully this member was a lot easier than the previous guy) It\'s not as interesting, I feel, as some of my other stories but is a good example as to why you shouldn\'t be a dick to people. \n\nSo if you haven\'t seen one of my other posts, I work in emergency roadside assistance (ERS) as a dispatcher. I work for a well known company where you can purchase a membership. We have 3 different levels but no matter which level you purchase, the rules for what is and isn\'t covered are the same. \n\nOne of the things we don\'t cover is something we call a piggy back tow. A piggy back tow is when a member calls in and places a call going a certain distance that\'s within their covered limit (max is 100 unless you have top and then you get 1 200mile tow) and then when that tow is finished they place another call going farther. They do this so they don\'t have to pay any over mile fees. This is not covered though. You get one tow per breakdown and if you need to go over your covered amount of miles, you have to pay for every mile over. \n\nWell about a year ago now this guy had a call placed. What we didn\'t realize was that the tow destination was for a convenience store. This is the first red flag because why would you tow to a convenience store???\n\nSo the garage goes out and tows the vehicle to where the member has to go. It about 50 miles I believe. \n\nSome time goes by, we forget about the call and I\'m updating members. I open a call and for some reason decided to look and see if there was anything in the notes and this is when I see that the member was requesting a specific garage and that that garage was already OL.\n\nProblem was that this garage was 50 miles away from this member so it didn\'t make sense why they were requesting them or why that garage was even in the area. So I looked up his call history and this is when I see he had a previous call. \n\nThe original was going 50 miles and the new call was going about 100 miles. The guy was only covered for 100 though. So I put 2 and 2 together and realized he was piggy backing. \n\nSo before calling him I called the garage and let them know that this guy isn\'t covered for another tow and they\'re gonna have to charge him. They say okay they\'ll let that driver know and hang up. It\'s a good thing I called them first. \n\nSo I call the member to explain that he can\'t piggy back and he\'ll have to pay for the 2nd tow. Whelp. I barley had a chance to even utter the words ""not covered"" before he went OFF. He wasn\'t yelling or anything but from the way he was talking, he was an ass. \n\nHis whole thing was because the person that took his call put the call through, we had to honor it and that the driver was already towing it and we can\'t back out now and just being really condescending/rude. If you\'ve ever had to deal with someone who wasn\'t yelling/being asshole but just wouldn\'t let you talk, talking to you like you\'re an idiot then you know what I was dealing with. \n\nHe had me so mad just with the way he was talking that my blood pressure shot up and my arms were shaking and it takes a lot to get me like that. \n\nBut I digress. \n\nI was trying to explain to him that it doesn\'t matter if the person that took his call didn\'t say anything, they were from another club and therefore couldn\'t\' see that he had placed a call earlier today or I\'m sure they would have told him no and even if they did see and didn\'t say anything, just because you got past them doesn\'t mean we have to just honor it. \n\nHe would not stop repeating that over and over. He seriously thought that because he was able to place the 2nd call without anyone saying to him it wasn\'t covered, that he ""won"" and that we were required to honor the tow and cover it anyways and that the garage was already towing it. \n\nThis is why I\'m glad I called the garage first. I told him that I already spoke with the garage and explained it wasn\'t covered and they\'ll be calling him shortly to arrange payment. He didn\'t care though and eventually, I had to transfer him to a supervisor who told him the same thing and wouldn\'t budge on it. \n\nThe thing is though he ended up screwing himself by being a dick. Because while we couldn\'t just allow the second tow, we could have saved him some money.\n\nIf the driver gets to the tow destination and the member changes their mind and wants to go somewhere else and they haven\'t dropped the vehicle yet, the driver can take them to the new address and they won\'t get charged for a second call because it hadn\'t been dropped yet so is tech considered the same tow. \n\nIf he had been nice we could have just pretended that the driver hadn\'t dropped the vehicle yet and had the driver continue the tow to the new destination and the member would have only had to pay for the miles going over the 100 miles. But because he was a dick I wasn\'t about to tell him that loophole. So he was towed and covered for 50 miles and ended up having to pay the driver a hook up fee and pay for 100 miles. If he had been nice though he could have been covered for his full 100 miles and only had to pay for 50 miles. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo moral of the story? Don\'t be a dick.\n\nP.S.

A doctor treated you. He\'s employed by us. In order for him to get paid, we need you to pay his bill.""\n\n""BUT I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. I DONT HAVE TO PAY FOR A DOCTOR.""\n\n""Incorrect.""\n\nThis continued to go on and on. I continually told him that the doctor needs to get paid somehow and even though he may have only met him for a second, he\'s still doing work behind the scenes. Every time he asked why the bill wasn\'t included in the hospital bill, I\'d dumb it down more and more. \n\n""Sir, the doctor?""\n\n""Yes?""\n\n""The doctor, you see, he doesn\'t work for the hospital.""\n\n""Okay.""\n\n""So he gets paid by us. This is why you\'re receiving a bill."" \n\n""NO YOURE NOT UNDERSTANDING ME. Why isn\'t it included with the hospital bill?""\n\nDoctor no work for emergency room, doctor work for us, hospital no pay doctor, we pay. \n\nFun times, y\'all.\n\nEDIT: \n\nI didn\'t really expect to be opening this sort of dialogue, but I\'m here for it.

Most ER&amp;#39;s split the bills so we handle the physician&amp;#39;s side of things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I literally had a patient go: &amp;quot;so you&amp;#39;re telling me, when I go to the emergency room, I have to pay for a DOCTOR?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yessir. A doctor treated you. He&amp;#39;s employed by us. In order for him to get paid, we need you to pay his bill.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;BUT I WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. I DONT HAVE TO PAY FOR A DOCTOR.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Incorrect.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This continued to go on and on. I continually told him that the doctor needs to get paid somehow and even though he may have only met him for a second, he&amp;#39;s still doing work behind the scenes. Every time he asked why the bill wasn&amp;#39;t included in the hospital bill, I&amp;#39;d dumb it down more and more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sir, the doctor?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The doctor, you see, he doesn&amp;#39;t work for the hospital.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So he gets paid by us. This is why you&amp;#39;re receiving a bill.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;NO YOURE NOT UNDERSTANDING ME. Why isn&amp;#39;t it included with the hospital bill?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doctor no work for emergency room, doctor work for us, hospital no pay doctor, we pay. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fun times, y&amp;#39;all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t really expect to be opening this sort of dialogue, but I&amp;#39;m here for it.

So would take calls about school places, roads, grass that hasn\'t been cut.... things like that. Occasionally we would get people try to put in insurance claims against the council for things like tripping over uneven paving slabs, burst tyres due to potholes etc.\n\nWe once had a crazy lady call and say she had just reversed into one of the streetlights on a public road. So I said okay no worries if you can let me know whereabouts the light is I can put a report through to ask an engineer to go and have a look at the damage and assess if it needs repairing and I thanked her for letting us know. Assumed that would be it, she then proceeded to say ""I didn\'t call to report the damage to the streetlight, I called about the damage to my car"".

Thing is, once the customer hears my accent (I am not an American), some take it as their cue to be racist and/or rude. One particular caller said to me, “Are you from the United States? I don’t want to talk to stupid monkeys, I want to speak to an American.”  \n\nThe thing about this telco company is that they wouldn’t allow the agents to hang up on those abusive callers, and I even remember one new agent bursting into tears when she was forced to continue with the call with such a customer. She quit shortly after that incident.  \n\nI worked in that account for a bit over two years until I resigned and found another post in another call centre, this time one handling multinational customers.

Thing is, once the customer hears my accent (I am not an American), some take it as their cue to be racist and/or rude. One particular caller said to me, “Are you from the United States? I don’t want to talk to stupid monkeys, I want to speak to an American.”  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The thing about this telco company is that they wouldn’t allow the agents to hang up on those abusive callers, and I even remember one new agent bursting into tears when she was forced to continue with the call with such a customer. She quit shortly after that incident.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I worked in that account for a bit over two years until I resigned and found another post in another call centre, this time one handling multinational customers.

I initially applied to verifcation specialist but they moved me to Customer Service since the VS department is mostly women... anyway, the first few days, the guy whose suppose to train me and this other dude isnt doing his job so the head boss has our main supervisor teach us the works in about 1 day with rest of week ready for us. Easy stuff in the end, just gotta call or pick up phone for payment declines, explain benefits, angry calls and save cancellations if possible. We were getting a good hang of it.\n\nThen on Monday, not everyone went to work due to heavy flooding from a storm. The head boss was the first in the office and I was the second. Suddenly he moves me outside to do Front calling. He tells me to follow the script, translate in spanish if needed, and to ask questions if needed as well. Also to shadow the best sales agent (Bruce) whose been there two months and started off like myself. I had about 8 calls, 3 leads, and 1 sale for my first day. Bruce gave me tips, was patient and kind throughout the day. The head boss gave me tips on what to say as well on a few leads but only one of those got closed while others were broke. Him and the two other agents there were satisfied with how I did for my first time doing Front and asked me if I wanted to stay. I said “yes”.\n\nNext day, Tuesday. Everyone is in the office. I get my assigned seat, get immediately to work. I almost made a sale within first 30 min but computer glitched out and the client didnt pick up phone after. The computers then had connection issues throughout day so I had to refresh the page constantly. The sales office manager, my new supervisor, sat me next to Bruce so I can be under his wing. Again, gave me tips and was patient with questions. Now this is where things got a bit pressuring....\n\nThe call monitor was here today so he was on top of my calls 24/7. Even interrupting some calls I was in the middle of to correct me on something or to say properly something to the client. And to heavily follow the script and no stray off it. Avoid saying “like” “um” “i mean”. He said I was doing good since I have high energy while talking but to slow down script and that he is only trying to help me out. He got on top of me about 15 times today. Mind you, for things that not even Bruce, office manager or the head boss complained about when they were listening to my calls.  It got to the point where the later half of the day I just lost confidence and was super careful on certain calls. Even skipped a few where I knew he would say something about. \n\nLater during lunch break, I walk past him and the front desk rep talking about my performance and how I don’t listen and not filling out the Front forms right. I only missed 3 details on the form which suprisingly Bruce or the head boss never corrected me on. I even overheard the office manager getting a bit aggravated. Day ends, head boss has meetting with us about a fresh sales agent who nearly lost a sale since the client didnt believe she was an agent but an operator. My old supervisor had to save it\n\nMy old supervisor asked my new one how I did. He said I had 5 leads and made 2 sales. And that I did better than the other front person who had no successful call the entire day. Old Supe then said that doing Front is good easy money and good start to being a licensed agent.\n\nLately, I’ve been thinking it over. I plan on going back to school for my Bachelors in January 2021. So I won’t be staying long since its full time, they don’t know that yet. I mainly got it to help the bills in the mean time. Thats the thing, I don’t know if in the mean time I should stick with Front or CS. I was planning on talking to old supe tomorrow about the situation.\n\nI can wait out till end of week to make final decision but if the call monitor gonna continue micro managing like this, I understand its his job but if he has to complain behind my back and hinder my performance like this after only 2 days of being suddenly switched departments, it may not be the right position for me and I would rather have my bearings in CS. Even the other dude working CS changed his mind about working the floor after dealing with similar treatment. And he was only put there for 2 hours just to see how it feels working there.\n\nIs this the right decision?\n\nTL;DR', 'author_fullname': 't2_51vo3kvw', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Deal with micromanaging or angry customer service calls?', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/talesfromcallcenters', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'long', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_js4kx2', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.75, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 4, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'L', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 4, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1605112716.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.talesfromcallcenters', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I started working at this call center for health insurance.

I was planning on talking to old supe tomorrow about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can wait out till end of week to make final decision but if the call monitor gonna continue micro managing like this, I understand its his job but if he has to complain behind my back and hinder my performance like this after only 2 days of being suddenly switched departments, it may not be the right position for me and I would rather have my bearings in CS. Even the other dude working CS changed his mind about working the floor after dealing with similar treatment. And he was only put there for 2 hours just to see how it feels working there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this the right decision?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': True, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2urem', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'js4kx2', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'MRZilla1954', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 2, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/js4kx2/deal_with_micromanaging_or_angry_customer_service/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/js4kx2/deal_with_micromanaging_or_angry_customer_service/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 208602, 'created_utc': 1605083916.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'talesfromcallcenters', 'selftext': ""Why the hell do people bother calling tech support if they feel that just because they googled around a little and tried out 2-3 standard troubleshooting steps on their own (restarting, checking WiFi settings, etc), that they're exempt from doing *any* of the troubleshooting steps with me on the phone, which I've been trained for in order to fix their problem, which I've fixed in countless other devices? \n\nIt makes no damn sense.

I pay 40 bucks a month for this internet and they told me I need to talk to a computer repairman!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;They checked your computer to try to get it to turn on, couldn&amp;#39;t, and said that you had to see someone else and we couldn&amp;#39;t help you further until that?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s right!&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Well, thank you so much for letting me know! I&amp;#39;ll make sure there&amp;#39;s a customer commendation on their employee file, and I wish you the best of luck getting your computer fixed fast and cheaply!&amp;quot; Is there anything else I can do for you?&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A commendation?? They didn&amp;#39;t help me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;As a matter of fact, they correctly told you the next step in your repair process, and followed company policy to the letter, I&amp;#39;m proud of my employee for that and I&amp;#39;ll make sure he knows it.

This is also a long post so I\'m sorry but this has been on my brain for months.\n\nBit of backstory, I started working at a call centre in June because I needed some money and they were offering work from home positions. The contract, while I obviously can\'t say exactly what it was, was a large american furniture company. The three weeks of training (yes, three) went by without issue and then after that I started as a full-on agent. On day six of taking calls this call came through that I can not forget. \n\nI answer the call in my usual way ""Thanks for calling customer care my name is (me), can i get your phone number please?"" (we got phone numbers and accounts up first before asking what we can do.\n\nI ask how I can help them and he tells me ""theres a bit of a problem with my sons bed and we need someone to come and fix it""\n\nI pull up the order, find the one he\'s talking about and get started on scheduling a repair tech to go out. I needed to know what specifically was going on so I asked ""what\'s going on with the bed?""\n\nHe tells me ""the front rail (it was a daybed) has sunk down and there are 14, yessir 14 nails sticking up out of it. They\'ve torn the mattress apart and they\'re a safety hazard""\n\nI ask him if anyone got hurt on it. ""My son got scratched very bad on it"" he says. So I start heading for a form for safety concern to fill it out, but the system wasn\'t working so I just had to schedule it the normal way. \n\nI get through the notes to scheduling and tell the customer that my first availability is two weeks away. He tells me straight up ""that won\'t work"". So of course at this point, I\'m thinking \'oh great, one of these people that wants me to make things happen out of thin air\'. I tell him I have no control over it and he says to me ""my son is non verbal autistic and loves that bed. He will not sleep anywhere else and I cannot have him cutting himself up on it every night""\n\nMy heart sank. I reached out for some help and thankfully one of my sup\'s took over on that one for me a few minutes later but I felt bad. I knew that guy was not going to get someone there any quicker than the two weeks I saw before. I had talked to many people before that had safety requests filled out and got nothing. \n\nAnd that killed me. I knew from the start I was not meant for customer service but I couldn\'t handle seeing that happen to someone again. That night I handed in my two weeks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry, this post was so long but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

The contract, while I obviously can&amp;#39;t say exactly what it was, was a large american furniture company. The three weeks of training (yes, three) went by without issue and then after that I started as a full-on agent. On day six of taking calls this call came through that I can not forget. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I answer the call in my usual way &amp;quot;Thanks for calling customer care my name is (me), can i get your phone number please?&amp;quot; (we got phone numbers and accounts up first before asking what we can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ask how I can help them and he tells me &amp;quot;theres a bit of a problem with my sons bed and we need someone to come and fix it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pull up the order, find the one he&amp;#39;s talking about and get started on scheduling a repair tech to go out. I needed to know what specifically was going on so I asked &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s going on with the bed?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He tells me &amp;quot;the front rail (it was a daybed) has sunk down and there are 14, yessir 14 nails sticking up out of it. They&amp;#39;ve torn the mattress apart and they&amp;#39;re a safety hazard&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ask him if anyone got hurt on it. &amp;quot;My son got scratched very bad on it&amp;quot; he says. So I start heading for a form for safety concern to fill it out, but the system wasn&amp;#39;t working so I just had to schedule it the normal way. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get through the notes to scheduling and tell the customer that my first availability is two weeks away. He tells me straight up &amp;quot;that won&amp;#39;t work&amp;quot;. So of course at this point, I&amp;#39;m thinking &amp;#39;oh great, one of these people that wants me to make things happen out of thin air&amp;#39;. I tell him I have no control over it and he says to me &amp;quot;my son is non verbal autistic and loves that bed. He will not sleep anywhere else and I cannot have him cutting himself up on it every night&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart sank. I reached out for some help and thankfully one of my sup&amp;#39;s took over on that one for me a few minutes later but I felt bad. I knew that guy was not going to get someone there any quicker than the two weeks I saw before. I had talked to many people before that had safety requests filled out and got nothing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that killed me. I knew from the start I was not meant for customer service but I couldn&amp;#39;t handle seeing that happen to someone again. That night I handed in my two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sorry, this post was so long but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

Just happened about 30 minutes ago. A true Karen of Karens. I work for a parking company that manages a university\'s parking for them, said university also has a major medical center on site that we also manage parking for. \n\n&gt;Me: ""Hello, ParkingCompany how can I help you?""\n\n&gt;Her: ""So, I was supposed to get a validation, but they told me their system was down and I\'m disabled so I couldn\'t walk all the way to the other building to get one. I was here for 5 hours and they didn\'t see me and can you just open the gate for me?""\n\nSo, first off, I smelled some immediate bullshit on the ""systems were down"" comment. The medical center\'s stamp validators run off of our system so if they were down, our system would be down too. The medical center also stocks a significant number of ""offline"" validations that are just stickers you can put on your ticket. \n\n&gt;Me: ""I\'m sorry ma\'am, but I can\'t waive parking rates so unfortunately you will have to pay the balance shown on the screen to exit""\n\n&gt;Her: ""Well I\'m not paying, just let me out.""\n\nAhh, so that\'s her game.\n\n&gt;Me: ""I can\'t do that ma\'am, I\'ll send somebody over to assist you further.""\n\nI hang up, and radio my field staff guy to head that way. I get about a minute of peace before the same woman calls back from the same help button, and I ignore it. Not going to talk to somebody who will be talking to somebody in person soon and who refused to pay. After about 3 minutes of having the call on waiting, it hangs up. I assume my field staff guy is there and I resume my usually nightly task of watching YouTube.\n\nAbout 2 minutes later, I get a call from a # I recognize all too well. Its University PD Dispatch. Huh, wonder what\'s up. \n\n&gt;Me: ""Hello, Parking Company, how can I help you today?""\n\n&gt;PD ""Hello, this is _____ With UniveristyPD Dispatch, we just got a call from a woman at GarageName, and were wondering if you had somebody on their way to assist them.""\n\n&gt;Me: ""Yes, I\'m aware of her. Somebody should be there now to help her.""\n\n&gt;PD: ""Okay, thank you. That\'s all we needed.""\n\n&gt;Me: ""No problem, when did she call you?""\n\n&gt;PD: ""About a minute ago.""\n\nAs she was saying that, my field staff guy called me on the radio.\n\n&gt;Field: ""Dispatch, she is refusing a Balance Due Form, and she said she\'s just going to wait for PD to show up""\n\n&gt;Me: (To Field)""Uhhh, im on the phone with PD right now, give me a sec"" (To PD) ""Are you guys sending officers over to her?""\n\n&gt;PD: ""Not at this time, no. Do you need us too?""\n\n&gt;Me: ""Nooo...that won\'t be necessary unless she escalates. We should be able to handle it for now.""\n\n&gt;PD: ""Alright, give us a call if you need anything."" \n\n&gt;Me: (To PD) "" Will do, goodbye."" (To Field) ""Yeah...I was just on the phone with PD Dispatch, they aren\'t sending anyone.""\n\n&gt;Field: ""But she said she was going to wait for them? She\'s telling them we are keeping her here against her will.""\n\n&gt;Me: ""Yeah, I\'m not sure where she got the idea they were going to come out and let her out. Go ahead and fill out that Balance Due Form. Get her plate and mark it as leaving without payment and I\'ll raise the gate. We\'ll see what she does when the gate goes up.""\n\n&gt;Field: ""Roger that.""\n\nSo I chill out for a couple of minutes while my field guy fills out the form with what we need. He gets it filled out and I raise the gate remotely, and she drives out and leaves to property. \n\nI get another call from PD right after I let her out. \n\n&gt;PD: ""Just calling to make sure, we were monitoring the situation and saw a vehicle just leave the center lane. Was that her?""\n\n&gt;Me: ""Yup, that was her. Everything should be done with.""\n\n&gt;PD: "" Sounds good, have a good night.""\n\n&gt;Me: ""Thanks, you too.""\n\nSo, here is what I suspect happened after working here for so long. She showed up at the hospital with a rather minor issue, and was left in the waiting room for 5 hours while more serious patients were seen first. I suspect she started getting pissy and causing problems, so security booted her from the hospital and told her to leave. When they do that, they don\'t let you back in for anything short of you actually dying, so she was unstable to go back and get her ticket validated. She then tried her spiel on us so she didn\'t have to pay. Sorry Karen, not goanna happen.\n\nTl;dr: Karen gonna Karen\n\nSmall update. This isn\'t her first citation.

I work for a parking company that manages a university&amp;#39;s parking for them, said university also has a major medical center on site that we also manage parking for. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Hello, ParkingCompany how can I help you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: &amp;quot;So, I was supposed to get a validation, but they told me their system was down and I&amp;#39;m disabled so I couldn&amp;#39;t walk all the way to the other building to get one. I was here for 5 hours and they didn&amp;#39;t see me and can you just open the gate for me?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, first off, I smelled some immediate bullshit on the &amp;quot;systems were down&amp;quot; comment. The medical center&amp;#39;s stamp validators run off of our system so if they were down, our system would be down too. The medical center also stocks a significant number of &amp;quot;offline&amp;quot; validations that are just stickers you can put on your ticket. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry ma&amp;#39;am, but I can&amp;#39;t waive parking rates so unfortunately you will have to pay the balance shown on the screen to exit&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: &amp;quot;Well I&amp;#39;m not paying, just let me out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ahh, so that&amp;#39;s her game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t do that ma&amp;#39;am, I&amp;#39;ll send somebody over to assist you further.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hang up, and radio my field staff guy to head that way. I get about a minute of peace before the same woman calls back from the same help button, and I ignore it. Not going to talk to somebody who will be talking to somebody in person soon and who refused to pay. After about 3 minutes of having the call on waiting, it hangs up. I assume my field staff guy is there and I resume my usually nightly task of watching YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 2 minutes later, I get a call from a # I recognize all too well. Its University PD Dispatch. Huh, wonder what&amp;#39;s up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Hello, Parking Company, how can I help you today?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PD &amp;quot;Hello, this is _____ With UniveristyPD Dispatch, we just got a call from a woman at GarageName, and were wondering if you had somebody on their way to assist them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Yes, I&amp;#39;m aware of her. Somebody should be there now to help her.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PD: &amp;quot;Okay, thank you. That&amp;#39;s all we needed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;No problem, when did she call you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PD: &amp;quot;About a minute ago.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As she was saying that, my field staff guy called me on the radio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Field: &amp;quot;Dispatch, she is refusing a Balance Due Form, and she said she&amp;#39;s just going to wait for PD to show up&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: (To Field)&amp;quot;Uhhh, im on the phone with PD right now, give me a sec&amp;quot; (To PD) &amp;quot;Are you guys sending officers over to her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PD: &amp;quot;Not at this time, no. Do you need us too?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Nooo...that won&amp;#39;t be necessary unless she escalates. We should be able to handle it for now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PD: &amp;quot;Alright, give us a call if you need anything.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: (To PD) &amp;quot; Will do, goodbye.&amp;quot; (To Field) &amp;quot;Yeah...I was just on the phone with PD Dispatch, they aren&amp;#39;t sending anyone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Field: &amp;quot;But she said she was going to wait for them? She&amp;#39;s telling them we are keeping her here against her will.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Yeah, I&amp;#39;m not sure where she got the idea they were going to come out and let her out. Go ahead and fill out that Balance Due Form. Get her plate and mark it as leaving without payment and I&amp;#39;ll raise the gate. We&amp;#39;ll see what she does when the gate goes up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Field: &amp;quot;Roger that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I chill out for a couple of minutes while my field guy fills out the form with what we need. He gets it filled out and I raise the gate remotely, and she drives out and leaves to property. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I get another call from PD right after I let her out. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;PD: &amp;quot;Just calling to make sure, we were monitoring the situation and saw a vehicle just leave the center lane. Was that her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Yup, that was her. Everything should be done with.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PD: &amp;quot; Sounds good, have a good night.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Thanks, you too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, here is what I suspect happened after working here for so long. She showed up at the hospital with a rather minor issue, and was left in the waiting room for 5 hours while more serious patients were seen first. I suspect she started getting pissy and causing problems, so security booted her from the hospital and told her to leave. When they do that, they don&amp;#39;t let you back in for anything short of you actually dying, so she was unstable to go back and get her ticket validated. She then tried her spiel on us so she didn&amp;#39;t have to pay. Sorry Karen, not goanna happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: Karen gonna Karen&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Small update. This isn&amp;#39;t her first citation. It put her over our $$ limit so after 45 days, if she shows up again without paying anything off, she gets a boot on the car.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 10, 'id': 'award_b56ba913-420f-40c3-9014-9c4d2a44dfe1', 'penny_donate': 0, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'coin_reward': 0, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/esahwi0raww51_ElectionDay.png', 'days_of_premium': 0, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/esahwi0raww51_ElectionDay.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15abe1a82e8370eba9d080c7519985758b68205c', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/esahwi0raww51_ElectionDay.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15d7efb510d47c918c102b911b588ca0fe21c908', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/esahwi0raww51_ElectionDay.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffc7ee9e64153fd6f270d4e0739316c470550824', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/esahwi0raww51_ElectionDay.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35cc3a50560b26c77638c2c56936fdd3866bd49d', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/esahwi0raww51_ElectionDay.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3695f68fb339d77af7b840a8961db7853a5e8f1b', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 2048, 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': False, 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'description': 'Your voice, your vote, your election.', 'end_date': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'name': 'Election Day', 'resized_static_icons': [{'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/esahwi0raww51_ElectionDay.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15abe1a82e8370eba9d080c7519985758b68205c', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/esahwi0raww51_ElectionDay.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=15d7efb510d47c918c102b911b588ca0fe21c908', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/esahwi0raww51_ElectionDay.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffc7ee9e64153fd6f270d4e0739316c470550824', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/esahwi0raww51_ElectionDay.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35cc3a50560b26c77638c2c56936fdd3866bd49d', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/esahwi0raww51_ElectionDay.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3695f68fb339d77af7b840a8961db7853a5e8f1b', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_format': 'PNG', 'icon_height': 2048, 'penny_price': 0, 'award_type': 'global', 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/esahwi0raww51_ElectionDay.png'}], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2urem', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'jn631c', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'Adric_01', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 58, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/jn631c/i_dont_let_a_woman_get_5_free_hours_of_parking_so/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/jn631c/i_dont_let_a_woman_get_5_free_hours_of_parking_so/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 208602, 'created_utc': 1604388377.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'talesfromcallcenters', 'selftext': 'I work as a team lead for a medical provider.

Sounds very military. Despite his lack of small talk, I eventually get him to share that he is indeed a veteran and that he and his old army buddy have a tradition every year of booking a room at our El Dorado resort and tying one on like the old days.\n\nI thank him for his service, tout the newly renovated bar lounge, as well as a few other places around campus that my brother recommends (he\'s a bartender and I don\'t drink so I rely on him) and tell him I\'m pleased to report we do in fact have a room for his dates. The call, so far, is easy peasy lemon squeezy.\n\nThen he said it.\n\nGrizzled Army Vet: ""And that\'s not a king bed, right?""\n\nMe: ""Yes sir, that is correct. The standard room comes with two queen beds.""\n\nGrizzled Army Vet: ""Okay, good. We\'re not in the navy, ya know.""\n\nTime of Death: 3:02 pm.\n\nI was done. Fell right out of my chair to the floor, laughing at the top of my lungs, pounding the cubicle wall. I don\'t know why that hit me so hard. Maybe it was the mock serious voice, the smile I could hear over the phone as he landed his joke, or just my own family history of army vs navy jokes, but I was absolutely useless for the next few minutes. Everyone within a few rows was popping up to figure out why I was suddenly interrupting their calls with laughter and my leader had to ask if I was okay.\n\nMy new favorite guest gave a chuckle and said he appreciated a man with a ""sophisticated sense of humor"" lol.

Would you be mine? Could you be mine?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Call starts off and a gruff voice tells me he wants to book a room at our El Dorado resort. Guy is no nonsense and his speech is short and to the point. Sounds very military. Despite his lack of small talk, I eventually get him to share that he is indeed a veteran and that he and his old army buddy have a tradition every year of booking a room at our El Dorado resort and tying one on like the old days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thank him for his service, tout the newly renovated bar lounge, as well as a few other places around campus that my brother recommends (he&amp;#39;s a bartender and I don&amp;#39;t drink so I rely on him) and tell him I&amp;#39;m pleased to report we do in fact have a room for his dates. The call, so far, is easy peasy lemon squeezy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he said it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grizzled Army Vet: &amp;quot;And that&amp;#39;s not a king bed, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Yes sir, that is correct. The standard room comes with two queen beds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grizzled Army Vet: &amp;quot;Okay, good. We&amp;#39;re not in the navy, ya know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time of Death: 3:02 pm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was done. Fell right out of my chair to the floor, laughing at the top of my lungs, pounding the cubicle wall. I don&amp;#39;t know why that hit me so hard. Maybe it was the mock serious voice, the smile I could hear over the phone as he landed his joke, or just my own family history of army vs navy jokes, but I was absolutely useless for the next few minutes. Everyone within a few rows was popping up to figure out why I was suddenly interrupting their calls with laughter and my leader had to ask if I was okay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My new favorite guest gave a chuckle and said he appreciated a man with a &amp;quot;sophisticated sense of humor&amp;quot; lol.

I deal with people\'s money. This call took place about a week ago. I really wish QA would\'ve pulled this one. It probably would\'ve given them a laugh.\n\nI had one lady call, opening the call like this: ""I know you\'re not a financial advisor, but do you think I should pull my money out of my accounts? Do you think the stock market will crash with the elections?""\n\nMe: ""...ma\'am..."" Cue white guy blinking gif. ""...I don\'t know if the stock market is going to crash, and as you stated, I\'m not a financial advisor, but there are federal protections for a certain amount of money per member."" \n\nI gave her a tl;dr history lesson about the stock market crash of 1929, Black Tuesday, and the resulting federal protections. I explained the FDIC and it\'s purpose. Credit unions are actually insured by the NCUA, but the same coverage applies as with the FDIC. She had quite a bit in her accounts with us, but not enough to reach the insurance threshold.\n\nL: ""Well, what should I do? Do you think the stock market will crash because of the elections? Is that money REALLY safe in the bank?""\n\nM: ""...ma\'am, as previously stated, I\'m not a financial advisor; however, I wouldn\'t pull it. Not only will it not be insured, but storing large amounts of cash or checks written for large amounts is not secure and potentially dangerous."" I tried to reassure her, repeating the bit about the FDIC and the insured amount. \n\nL: ""Okay, but what if..."" I ended up repeating the same insurance speech and history lesson again before she was satisfied with the answer. She thanked me and disconnected.

It probably would&amp;#39;ve given them a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had one lady call, opening the call like this: &amp;quot;I know you&amp;#39;re not a financial advisor, but do you think I should pull my money out of my accounts? Do you think the stock market will crash with the elections?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;...ma&amp;#39;am...&amp;quot; Cue white guy blinking gif. &amp;quot;...I don&amp;#39;t know if the stock market is going to crash, and as you stated, I&amp;#39;m not a financial advisor, but there are federal protections for a certain amount of money per member.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I gave her a tl;dr history lesson about the stock market crash of 1929, Black Tuesday, and the resulting federal protections. I explained the FDIC and it&amp;#39;s purpose. Credit unions are actually insured by the NCUA, but the same coverage applies as with the FDIC. She had quite a bit in her accounts with us, but not enough to reach the insurance threshold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;L: &amp;quot;Well, what should I do? Do you think the stock market will crash because of the elections? Is that money REALLY safe in the bank?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;M: &amp;quot;...ma&amp;#39;am, as previously stated, I&amp;#39;m not a financial advisor; however, I wouldn&amp;#39;t pull it. Not only will it not be insured, but storing large amounts of cash or checks written for large amounts is not secure and potentially dangerous.&amp;quot; I tried to reassure her, repeating the bit about the FDIC and the insured amount. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;L: &amp;quot;Okay, but what if...&amp;quot; I ended up repeating the same insurance speech and history lesson again before she was satisfied with the answer. She thanked me and disconnected.

Bastard STILL cuts me off in the middle saying he &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t caaaare&lt;/em&gt; and continues to bitch about his customer and his web presence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a few minutes after we&amp;#39;re to leave for the day. I am tired, and I am very hungry, and both of those factors combined isn&amp;#39;t really doing much to quell my growing anxiety. I&amp;#39;m sitting there speechless for several minutes unsure how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, HE ends the call saying that he and I don&amp;#39;t see eye to eye, asked for my name, and that if he ever called tech support again, he&amp;#39;d make sure not to get me. HE is the one who said &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;re getting nowhere&amp;quot; after he spent the past 15-20 minutes &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ACTIVELY REFUSING TO LET ME FIX THE PROBLEM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I just told him I&amp;#39;d look into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ended up DMing my manager and letting him know the whole exchange. Manager gave me the go-ahead to just delete the picture and let him know the problem was fixed since the guy was being that difficult about it. I sent him a sickly sweet, obnoxiously happy-go-lucky email telling him this, signed with a closer I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; use:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I hope you have an absolutely wonderful rest of your evening!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: some customers need to be thrown in the sea and that&amp;#39;s the honest goddamn truth&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': None, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 150, 'id': 'award_f44611f1-b89e-46dc-97fe-892280b13b82', 'penny_donate': None, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'coin_reward': 0, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png', 'days_of_premium': 0, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5662dfbdb402bf67866c050aa76c31c147c2f45', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a6882eb3f380e8e88009789f4d0072e17b8c59f1', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e50064b090879e8a0b55e433f6ee61d5cb5fbe1d', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e5bb2e76683cb6b161830bcdd9642049d6adc11', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/klvxk1wggfd41_Helpful.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eda4a9246f95f42ee6940cc0ec65306fd20de878', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 2048, 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'description': 'Thank you stranger.

I just turned it on for the first time today. \n\nOP: Um. So you had two laptops worked on and you only turned one of them on?\n\nDC: Yes. Correct. So now you have to fix the one that’s not working. \n\nOP: I’m…pretty sure we can’t do that. Again, the work was done two years ago. \n\nDC: I get that.

I would. Sure. Yeah.\n\nOP: With all due respect, I don’t believe you. There is literally no way you could verify what’s actually happened in the past two years with that car.\n\nDC: Look. I’d…want to take pride in my work and make the customer happy.\n\nOP: So do I. But I’d be a horrible businessman if just let people void the warranty. \n\nDC: Well, come on, the warranty should start from the time you start using it. \n\nOP: Um. No. If you’d turned it on two years ago and it didn’t work, certainly we’d fix it. But not now. Sorry. \n\nDC: (grumbles for a few more minutes) Well.

No. If you’d turned it on two years ago and it didn’t work, certainly we’d fix it. But not now. Sorry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DC: (grumbles for a few more minutes) Well.

I'm unsure how the rules are for entering the country? Do they need a corona test? \n\nMe: Thanks for the question. *Explanation:* Weather and how people can enter depends on their citizenship, the country they travel from, and their reason for the visit. \nIf your employees /partners have paid work to do in this country, they have a valid reason, but weather they need a recent, valid Corona-test to cross the border depends on the country they travel from. [There are about six countries left in the world that don't require a test, and they are falling like dominoes] \nSo, are they foreigners and where do they travel to this country from?\n\nC: They are all foreigners, *lists a few countries where they come from*\n\nMe: A few of these countries will require them to have taken a Covid-test to enter, even if they fulfill the requirement for a valid reason. \n\nC: But they can't get a test with such short notice! It takes weeks to book a test! They fly in today! I called you a few days ago and asked your colleague, they said they didn't need the test??? \n\nMe: That's weird. These are basic rules, every one of my colleagues would have told you they need a test. \nWhen did you call and who did you talk to? \n\nC: I can't remember who i talked to or when i called. \n\nMe: Alright, the only solution i can offer you is for your employees to fill out this form that says you promise to take a test immediately and then self-quarantine for 48 hours. \n\nC: No good! They can't self-quarantine, the photo-shoot is today! \n\nMe: Then they can't come in. They incriminate themselves if they don't follow the agreement they signed. Now, i think one of the countries you named doesn't require a test, but some of them definitely do. Can you repeat the countries so i can tell you which people can enter? \n\nC: No, they all need to enter today, there must be a solution! The coworker [who she can't remember] that i talked with a few days ago [she can't remember when] told me they could enter! \n\nMe: I apologize if we gave you wrong or unclear information, but the rules can not be bent. They need to stay out or quarantine for 48 hours. I'm sorry. One person on your list might be able to enter though, might i get the countries again? \n\nC: No! There has to be a solution here! I want to talk to someone else! \n\nMe: I will ask my supervisor. \n\n*walks over to supervisor*\n\nS: [immediately] Is she muted? \n\nMe:*mutes her*\n\nS: I'm not gonna talk to her. You need to make clear to her what the rules are. \n\nMe to c: *explains everything again*\n\nC: *says the same as before*\n\nMe: I really want to help you here. Some of your models might me able to enter without a test. May i have the countries again? \n\nAnd now, get this, SHE decides that she is fed up with ME. So she gets snappy in her tone and interrupts me:\n\nC: Maybe you should have written them down, then you wouldn't have to ask all the time!?\n\nMe: You told me the countries once. I don't need the countries. You need the information. I'm trying to help you. \n\nC: Maybe i don't want to talk to someone who screams at me?????? [i didn't] I want to talk to someone else! \n\nFinally, my supervisor has mercy with me and takes the phone. Talks extremely calmly for about a minute.

These are basic rules, every one of my colleagues would have told you they need a test. \nWhen did you call and who did you talk to? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: I can&amp;#39;t remember who i talked to or when i called. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Alright, the only solution i can offer you is for your employees to fill out this form that says you promise to take a test immediately and then self-quarantine for 48 hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: No good! They can&amp;#39;t self-quarantine, the photo-shoot is today! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Then they can&amp;#39;t come in. They incriminate themselves if they don&amp;#39;t follow the agreement they signed. Now, i think one of the countries you named doesn&amp;#39;t require a test, but some of them definitely do. Can you repeat the countries so i can tell you which people can enter? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: No, they all need to enter today, there must be a solution! The coworker [who she can&amp;#39;t remember] that i talked with a few days ago [she can&amp;#39;t remember when] told me they could enter! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I apologize if we gave you wrong or unclear information, but the rules can not be bent. They need to stay out or quarantine for 48 hours. I&amp;#39;m sorry. One person on your list might be able to enter though, might i get the countries again? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: No! There has to be a solution here! I want to talk to someone else! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I will ask my supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;walks over to supervisor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;S: [immediately] Is she muted? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me:&lt;em&gt;mutes her&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;S: I&amp;#39;m not gonna talk to her. You need to make clear to her what the rules are. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me to c: &lt;em&gt;explains everything again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: &lt;em&gt;says the same as before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I really want to help you here. Some of your models might me able to enter without a test. May i have the countries again? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now, get this, SHE decides that she is fed up with ME. So she gets snappy in her tone and interrupts me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Maybe you should have written them down, then you wouldn&amp;#39;t have to ask all the time!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: You told me the countries once. I don&amp;#39;t need the countries. You need the information. I&amp;#39;m trying to help you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Maybe i don&amp;#39;t want to talk to someone who screams at me?????? [i didn&amp;#39;t] I want to talk to someone else! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, my supervisor has mercy with me and takes the phone. Talks extremely calmly for about a minute. Then the call ends. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;S to me: Because of a photo shoot? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2urem', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'jj531r', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': '8euztnrqvn', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 28, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/jj531r/i_dont_like_the_truth_so_im_not_gonna_give_you/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/jj531r/i_dont_like_the_truth_so_im_not_gonna_give_you/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 208602, 'created_utc': 1603818181.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'talesfromcallcenters', 'selftext': 'Part of my job involves taking escalated calls, so this woman had been on the line with the agent for about 35 minutes and was either not listening or not willing to understand the situation. \n\nBasically a few years ago she had given us authority to direct debit her bank account for her son’s membership.

Even as a phone banker, Im still able to provide for myself, my family and live very, VERY comfortably AND I\'m already investing for a business that I\'m putting up by next year.\n\nTo sum that up, Im proud to be an independent and successful woman.\n\nAnd why dear folks am I bothering you with this info? \n\nBecause this particular interraction with the customer makes me want to choke the living hell out of him for being racist, sexist and for feeling entitled. \n\n* cue flashback *\n\n(Full disclosure, some parts may have been paraphrased since its been almost four months since this call happened)\n\nMe: Hello!

You shouldnt even be doing this job! You just need to find a foreign guy and seduce him to taking you to the US! Thats the only thing you are good for! Nothing else! You people take our jobs here in the States when you shouldnt even be working! \n\n(At this point I was already pissed off of him, but company policy states we cant hang up in our customers)\n\nMe: If thats your opinion, sir.

Do your job and remove it right now!\n\n(I was already soooo tempted to hang up on him, he\'s demanding for me to do something when he wasnt even giving me details about his card info so I can see the account, nor the details about the transaction he wants me to remove, and since its a cancelation of a charge which is another department handles, i could just transfer him directly without taking the details since the other dept will just ask it from him again and we wanted to avoid any frustration from the customer about repeating information. \n\nMe: Sir, I\'m afraid I\'m not capable of removing your charge.

My job is to answer the phone for people needing help exiting my companies garages at a university on the normally quiet 3rd shift. \n\nAround 12:30am, I get a call from a lady\n\n&gt;Lady: ""I paid, but the gate won\'t go up to let me out""\n\nI check our system and see no charge processed at the gate she is calling from. I inform her of this, and she insists up and down that she paid. So, with nothing I can really do for her, I send out my one field guy to talk to her. I hear nothing for 30 minutes, and figure it was dealt with, until he calls me on the radio.\n\n&gt;Field Guy: ""Uhh, dispatch, she has taken the plates off of her vehicle and I think she\'s going to run though the gate, can you call University PD?\n\nSo, shit just got interesting, and I call PD and send them that way. Its all quiet, for the next hour and a half, just getting updates that the police are still talking to the woman, until I get the final call. \n\n&gt;Field Guy: ""Dispatch, she is being arrested. Her grandfather is taking the car now, so we don\'t need to call a tow truck""\n\nI contain my curiosity, and tell him to come to the office for an incident report where I can get the juicy details. \n\nSo, I present for you, the juicy details.\n\nShe started her whole spiel of paying to the field guy, but couldn\'t show any proof. She was asked when she came in and how much she paid. The rate she claims she paid and the time she came in don\'t match up, so that\'s strike one. She then changed her story to her mom paid for her. Mom was nowhere to be seen and couldn\'t be contacted by the driver. Strike two. \n\nShe leaves the gate, and parks in the garage, and the field guy hangs out until she comes back to the gate. Once she is there again, he offers to fill out a form that will let her pay later, or even dispute the charge if she wanted too. That was denied, and she began face timing some guy.

I work for a cable company that provides internet and phone. Guess who lol. I am the next thing to a supervisor so I handle frontline escalations and overrides on a daily. An agent calls our escalation line stating a customer is upset because the tech did not install their two new cable boxes and told them they should use Roku devices instead. Ok... que me reviewing the notes and recent work orders on the account. The tech marked the order resolution as complete due to unsafe conditions. The notes state he called his supervisor who then called dispatch stating there was feces in the basement and tech could not complete the job until it was cleaned up. I got my giggles out and prepared to take the call. \n\nThe customer begins by saying how frustrated he is and how he is going to a competitor blah blah blah. I listen without interruption. I state the reason the tech left due to caca in the area where he needs to make the connections in the basement. This mans rebuttal is that the dookie was nowhere near where he needed to make the connections. I had to mute myself there to find an appropriate statement without hurting his feelings. I said sir some people can not tolerate certain smells of that nature and round it out with asking if the basement was clean and we could reschedule the appointment. He then says his wife was busy with his niece all morning and didn’t have a chance to clean the area before the tech came. In my mind I’m like who the hell lets their animal crap in their friggin basement for Christ sake!!! Take them outside. I hear the wife in the background like it wasn’t even our dogs that made the mess... so wait your neighbor who shares the space allows them to crap there too. What is wrong with you people.\n\nThen the customer goes that’s not even the main issue. The tech tells me when he gets inside that it’s stupid of him to use cable boxes and to use a roku device they are way better and save you money. In my head that translates to your house stinks and I don’t want to be here lol. He then asks if he should just go to another service provider and of course I reply that is your decision sir you are not in a contract.

I work for a cable company that provides internet and phone. Guess who lol. I am the next thing to a supervisor so I handle frontline escalations and overrides on a daily. An agent calls our escalation line stating a customer is upset because the tech did not install their two new cable boxes and told them they should use Roku devices instead. Ok... que me reviewing the notes and recent work orders on the account. The tech marked the order resolution as complete due to unsafe conditions. The notes state he called his supervisor who then called dispatch stating there was feces in the basement and tech could not complete the job until it was cleaned up. I got my giggles out and prepared to take the call. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The customer begins by saying how frustrated he is and how he is going to a competitor blah blah blah. I listen without interruption. I state the reason the tech left due to caca in the area where he needs to make the connections in the basement. This mans rebuttal is that the dookie was nowhere near where he needed to make the connections. I had to mute myself there to find an appropriate statement without hurting his feelings. I said sir some people can not tolerate certain smells of that nature and round it out with asking if the basement was clean and we could reschedule the appointment. He then says his wife was busy with his niece all morning and didn’t have a chance to clean the area before the tech came. In my mind I’m like who the hell lets their animal crap in their friggin basement for Christ sake!!! Take them outside. I hear the wife in the background like it wasn’t even our dogs that made the mess... so wait your neighbor who shares the space allows them to crap there too. What is wrong with you people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the customer goes that’s not even the main issue. The tech tells me when he gets inside that it’s stupid of him to use cable boxes and to use a roku device they are way better and save you money. In my head that translates to your house stinks and I don’t want to be here lol. He then asks if he should just go to another service provider and of course I reply that is your decision sir you are not in a contract. He asks to speak with someone above me and calls me a cunt while speaking to his wife. I checked the account later in the day and there was no appointment rescheduled so I am guessing they called the competitor. I still can’t get over the fact that they think it’s ok for their dog to poo poo in the basement... disgusting lol&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2urem', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'jfv02k', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': '2hotttotrot1', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 15, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/jfv02k/clean_up_your_dog_caca_and_then_maybe_your/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/jfv02k/clean_up_your_dog_caca_and_then_maybe_your/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 208602, 'created_utc': 1603350969.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'talesfromcallcenters', 'selftext': ""The company I take in calls for has a delivery option via USPS , and lately we have been receiving so many calls from customers not receiving their mail.

I specifically work in a department that gives people medical aids out of their insurance. To do my job I need to sort of make prescriptions for the medical aids. Some people need beds to die in a some just need some aids to help them get around and others have life long disabilities. I need to know the law, the aids and be able to write these prescriptions. As you might expect this means that I can see a lot of personal information, just like a select few coworkers. This however isn\'t the case for most people working in the company.\n\nEven tho\' you can keep the aids for 6 months untill you need to ask for them at your local government institute, we send out letters at 2 months of use, because the government can be terribly slow. Most people however don\'t need more than 6 months of use and this often leads to calls, because the letters are standardized. Again... we can\'t make a distinction between medical needs, because this is very private information. \n\nThis also leads to some weird notes from and to coworkers. You can\'t say ""Bob isn\'t able to get out of his bathtub due to weak muscles, and therefore the current medical aid is is insufficient and we need to replace it with this medical aid.""  But we can say ""Medical aid 1 isn\'t working, get medical aid 2"" There is absolutly no one who can question any decision I make.\n\nOk... back to the topic. Today I got a lady that was absolutly appalled that we send her a letter. I explained to her that even tho\' she doesn\'t have a need to use them for more than 6 months, there are plenty people who do. To make sure that people don\'t pay for their own medical aid (they are extremly expensive) we send out these letters. ""OK BUT I FIND IT APPALING THAT I GOT THIS LETTER, IT WASNT MEANT FOR ME."" ""Madam, we can\'t make that destinction to protect your and others privacy."" She said she understood, but immediately went back to ""Well, ok you\'re a weird company and I still find it absolutly crazy that you send me a letter that wasn\'t meant for me."" I have absolutly no time for this bullshit, when people are in need of a bed, because they are quite literally dieing. I told her the information she needed regarding her medical aid and even extended the period she could rent one of her medical aids (that wasn\'t covered by insurance) free of charge. Because you know... sometimes we do and we understand that some people need help. Even after all of that she was still mad an basically calling us horrible for sending that letter. So I did what I usually do. Ramble all the specifications and information she needed in one big breath and then said ""Do you have anymore questions?"" She stuttered a no. ""No?"" ""Allright then I wish you very well. Have a nice day."" Ofcourse people can\'t resist to say ""Goodbye."" I mute my phone and go on with my day. Not much of a spectacle, but still needed to get it of my chest.\n\nHere are the basics for anybody who wants to get a medidal aid at expense of insurance:\n1. You are not the customer. Your insurance is.\n2. I am not going to tell you how sick you need to be in order to get an aid. You tell me.\n3. You can call you insurance, and they will do... absolutly nothing. \n4. You don\'t get the aid while you don\'t need them, you don\'t get a speciality bed because you like the convenience. Youre only taking away a bed from somebody who\'s really in need if you do.\n5. All people trained to do medical prescriptions can see eachothers notes. Calling back doesn\'t work, if you don\'t have new information that will qualify you for the aid.', 'author_fullname': 't2_5m1m8jei', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Not your usual customer service', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/talesfromcallcenters', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'medium', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_jeuqom', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.95, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 46, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'M', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 46, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': 1603219263.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1603245198.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.talesfromcallcenters', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I work for a company that basically sends out medical aids. I specifically work in a department that gives people medical aids out of their insurance. To do my job I need to sort of make prescriptions for the medical aids. Some people need beds to die in a some just need some aids to help them get around and others have life long disabilities. I need to know the law, the aids and be able to write these prescriptions. As you might expect this means that I can see a lot of personal information, just like a select few coworkers. This however isn&amp;#39;t the case for most people working in the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even tho&amp;#39; you can keep the aids for 6 months untill you need to ask for them at your local government institute, we send out letters at 2 months of use, because the government can be terribly slow. Most people however don&amp;#39;t need more than 6 months of use and this often leads to calls, because the letters are standardized. Again... we can&amp;#39;t make a distinction between medical needs, because this is very private information. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This also leads to some weird notes from and to coworkers. You can&amp;#39;t say &amp;quot;Bob isn&amp;#39;t able to get out of his bathtub due to weak muscles, and therefore the current medical aid is is insufficient and we need to replace it with this medical aid.&amp;quot;  But we can say &amp;quot;Medical aid 1 isn&amp;#39;t working, get medical aid 2&amp;quot; There is absolutly no one who can question any decision I make.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok... back to the topic.

I shall leave it to your imagination to figure out which one, and will neither confirm or deny it.\n\nI will however say, that to whoever called me that day, which I will call Angry Australian Man-child (AAM) thanks for the mental trauma...\n\nSo, on to the story. It’s the last call of my last day at work, I do my usual “Thanks for calling us, how can I help you today?”\n\nThe call came through to our console support line and Angry Australian Man-child is on the other end of the line. He has an issue with his console. It’s a common issue, they accidentally knocked their power cord, corrupted their hard drive, and the console is in safe mode, needing a software installation file.\n\nNow, normal people, at the very least, have a computer or laptop for everyday use. One simply needs to go to our website and download the right file from said site, put it into a flash stick of decent size, and simply plug it in and follow the prompts.\n\nBut not Mr. Man-child, oh no, he bragged like an arrogant fanboy about “not having a computer because our console was all he needed as it’s the best”.\n\nWhilst I thanked him for the compliment, this unfortunately made support for him that much more difficult. This was especially the case with the current situations going on.\n\nSo, after taking down his details to log his call and incident, I asked politely, “Okay, well....do you have any neighbours or friends that you could borrow a computer or laptop device?”\n\nTo this Mr. Man-child said no. Figures.\n\nThe next solution that I asked was, “Right...Do you have access to a Public Library of any sort? They most likely have computers you can use.”\n\nMr. Man-Child did hint likely of this, so that was one option to utilise, and for me an out at least.\n\nLast question I asked was, “Okay, that’s one avenue we can proceed with. The alternative is if you have a smart device, do you use an Android or Apple Device?”\n\nThankfully, Mr. Man-Child said Android.\n\nWith this I had his solution plan laid out for him,” Okay, here is what I can do for you, I will be sending you an email to your contact email with instructions. It’s very important you have access to a computer and flash drive to do this, sir. \n\nAlternatively, you can use your mobile phone to download the file, but you will need a special cable to transfer the file and format the flash drive to the right settings.\n\nOnce you follow those instructions, to the letter, you should be able to have your console back up and run-“\n\nTo this, Mr. Man-Child decided to interject and ask, “So you’re saying my console is broken?”\n\nConfused as to why he asked that, I politely reiterated that his console wasn’t broken, namely that it’s in safe mode needing the software to be installed on it. I explained to him a PC analogy of BIOS screen if one’s operating system is corrupted or non existent.\n\nThis however didn’t deter Mr. Man-Child to make a wild assumption, “So that means my console won’t be fixed?!

I shall leave it to your imagination to figure out which one, and will neither confirm or deny it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I will however say, that to whoever called me that day, which I will call Angry Australian Man-child (AAM) thanks for the mental trauma...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, on to the story. It’s the last call of my last day at work, I do my usual “Thanks for calling us, how can I help you today?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The call came through to our console support line and Angry Australian Man-child is on the other end of the line. He has an issue with his console. It’s a common issue, they accidentally knocked their power cord, corrupted their hard drive, and the console is in safe mode, needing a software installation file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, normal people, at the very least, have a computer or laptop for everyday use. One simply needs to go to our website and download the right file from said site, put it into a flash stick of decent size, and simply plug it in and follow the prompts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not Mr. Man-child, oh no, he bragged like an arrogant fanboy about “not having a computer because our console was all he needed as it’s the best”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst I thanked him for the compliment, this unfortunately made support for him that much more difficult. This was especially the case with the current situations going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, after taking down his details to log his call and incident, I asked politely, “Okay, well....do you have any neighbours or friends that you could borrow a computer or laptop device?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To this Mr. Man-child said no. Figures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next solution that I asked was, “Right...Do you have access to a Public Library of any sort? They most likely have computers you can use.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Man-Child did hint likely of this, so that was one option to utilise, and for me an out at least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Last question I asked was, “Okay, that’s one avenue we can proceed with. The alternative is if you have a smart device, do you use an Android or Apple Device?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Mr. Man-Child said Android.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this I had his solution plan laid out for him,” Okay, here is what I can do for you, I will be sending you an email to your contact email with instructions. It’s very important you have access to a computer and flash drive to do this, sir. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can use your mobile phone to download the file, but you will need a special cable to transfer the file and format the flash drive to the right settings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once you follow those instructions, to the letter, you should be able to have your console back up and run-“&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To this, Mr. Man-Child decided to interject and ask, “So you’re saying my console is broken?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Confused as to why he asked that, I politely reiterated that his console wasn’t broken, namely that it’s in safe mode needing the software to be installed on it. I explained to him a PC analogy of BIOS screen if one’s operating system is corrupted or non existent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This however didn’t deter Mr. Man-Child to make a wild assumption, “So that means my console won’t be fixed?! That means it’s useless! I spent a lot of money on this console!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reiterated, “Sir, your console just needs a software installation. I have explained how it can be fixed, you just need a computer and flash drive, okay?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next thing I hear is Mr. Man-Child, after a brief pause, starting to smash his console, cursing and yelling up a storm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had to cut the call at the point, I wasn’t paid to take his abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at least now he can say his console is broken, and if he calls support again, I’d love to see him try to explain why his out of warranty fee should be waived.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': None, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 100, 'id': 'gid_1', 'penny_donate': None, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'coin_reward': 0, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png', 'days_of_premium': 0, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 512, 'static_icon_width': 512, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'description': ""Shows the Silver Award... and that's it."", 'end_date': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'static_icon_height': 512, 'name': 'Silver', 'resized_static_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 512, 'penny_price': None, 'award_type': 'global', 'static_icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/silver_512.png'}], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2urem', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'jdqdql', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'keikoandgilly', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 75, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/jdqdql/call_centre_nam_flashbacks/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/jdqdql/call_centre_nam_flashbacks/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 208602, 'created_utc': 1603062302.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'talesfromcallcenters', 'selftext': 'Any other women out there who put men on hold because it\'s the only way to shut them up? 4 different dudes tonight just ranting and not letting me talk to the point where I just put them on hold for like 5 minutes just to get them to shut the hell up.  \n\nI do credit card escalations.

I work in emergency roadside assistance (ERS) as a dispatcher (DI). Night shift doesn't always have a supervisor and last night was one of those nights which is why we found out about this right way. The DI from 3rd shift immediately messaged our supervisor when she got in around 6:30am. This happened at 4am last night.\n\nSo like I just said, we got a call around 4am last night for a vehicle the had no keys. The driver goes out and arrives on location but the customer wasn't there yet. So while he was waiting for the customer to arrive, he starts loading the vehicle up. Well the customer arrives and she and (We're assuming it's her husband/boyfriend) jump out and tell the driver they no longer need service.\n\nSo the driver says okay just let me get it unhooked. Instead of the member waiting for him to finish, they jump in the vehicle while it was still on the back of his truck. (This is a big no no) As he's removing the last chain, the member starts the car and throws the vehicle in reverse and guns the vehicle off the back of the truck and RUN OVER THE ARM OF THE DRIVER IN THE PROCESS.\n\nNow, most people would immediately stop and offer to call an ambulance or to at least check on the driver but nope. They took off. The driver ends up call us and (understandably) was screaming and crying from the pain. The DI that got his call ended up calling an ambulance for him but did lose connection with him and he didn't answer when she called him back. She ended up calling the owner of the company he worked for (we call them garages) to let them know what happened.\n\nMy supervisor did call the owner herself as well and thankfully the driver is doing okay. They're talking to the member now and will be filing a police report.

I work in emergency roadside assistance (ERS) as a dispatcher (DI). Night shift doesn&amp;#39;t always have a supervisor and last night was one of those nights which is why we found out about this right way. The DI from 3rd shift immediately messaged our supervisor when she got in around 6:30am. This happened at 4am last night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So like I just said, we got a call around 4am last night for a vehicle the had no keys. The driver goes out and arrives on location but the customer wasn&amp;#39;t there yet. So while he was waiting for the customer to arrive, he starts loading the vehicle up. Well the customer arrives and she and (We&amp;#39;re assuming it&amp;#39;s her husband/boyfriend) jump out and tell the driver they no longer need service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the driver says okay just let me get it unhooked. Instead of the member waiting for him to finish, they jump in the vehicle while it was still on the back of his truck. (This is a big no no) As he&amp;#39;s removing the last chain, the member starts the car and throws the vehicle in reverse and guns the vehicle off the back of the truck and RUN OVER THE ARM OF THE DRIVER IN THE PROCESS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, most people would immediately stop and offer to call an ambulance or to at least check on the driver but nope. They took off. The driver ends up call us and (understandably) was screaming and crying from the pain. The DI that got his call ended up calling an ambulance for him but did lose connection with him and he didn&amp;#39;t answer when she called him back. She ended up calling the owner of the company he worked for (we call them garages) to let them know what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My supervisor did call the owner herself as well and thankfully the driver is doing okay. They&amp;#39;re talking to the member now and will be filing a police report. I just want to know what was going through the members head because I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that if you didn&amp;#39;t FEEL it when you ran over his arm that you would have figured it out by the drivers screams.

company and one of the calls we get most is about payment arrangements for the bill. I am happy to help, but I'd be even happier if I didn't get yelled at because of a misunderstanding.\n\nSo we started out fine. I took a small payment, then she asked about a payment arrangement for the rest of her past due bill. I explained what we could do for her. The first payment is always due like the next week and it defaults to an amount that would be similar to the payments further out. So say her total was $300, split into 6 payments. $50 due next week. She tells me that she cannot pay that so soon. So when I want to help out a customer, I start thinking of ways that I can go around the system.

I am happy to help, but I&amp;#39;d be even happier if I didn&amp;#39;t get yelled at because of a misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we started out fine. I took a small payment, then she asked about a payment arrangement for the rest of her past due bill. I explained what we could do for her. The first payment is always due like the next week and it defaults to an amount that would be similar to the payments further out. So say her total was $300, split into 6 payments. $50 due next week. She tells me that she cannot pay that so soon. So when I want to help out a customer, I start thinking of ways that I can go around the system.

The three most common kinds of frustrating calls I had, naturally, all had to do with money, no surprise there: (all of these have been approximated to the average question from them and average responses by me)\n\n1) ""My (relative) died a little while ago, and in their things, I found this life insurance policy from 1963, how do I go about claiming this?""\n\n*Well, yes they took one out in 1963, but then they stopped paying for it in 1966. No, I don\'t care that you have a physical policy in your hand that says you\'re entitled to money.  We don\'t just come and break in your house and punch you until you give it back.  It isn\'t worth anything unless you follow all the parts of the policy until they pass away, including paying us. No, I don\'t care that you think they did. I know they didn\'t, so unless you can find me some proof of that.  No, I don\'t care that you\'ll sue us because you\'re holding a policy. This will not make it to court, that\'s a contract which they stopped following 50 years ago, not an IOU.*\n\n2) ""My (relative) is in the hospital, they\'re not going to make it, how do I claim this policy?\n\n*(Disclaimer, if this were a five, ten thousand dollar policy that the caller was worried about because it was the only way they were going to pay for a funeral, I would have some sympathy to the issue in that situation, for sure.  This was virtually never the case. This was virtually always an entitled-sounding grandkid with a very expensive policy.) Um, first they actually have to pass away.  No, being sick and close is not good enough.  No, I don\'t want to talk to the doctor.  No, you need a death certificate first.  No, you can\'t fill out most of the form right now and send that in later.  NO WE CAN\'T TAKE YOUR WORD THAT THIS IS ""CLOSE ENOUGH""*\n\n3) ""I\'m cancelling my policy.  Since I never used it, how do I get back all that money I put into it?""\n\n*(Disclaimer #2, there are certain kinds of policies where you do get money back when you cancel it, depending on circumstances and type, I\'m not going to get into those. Suffice it to say, these calls were never those kinds of policy.) ""Yeah, I do realize that you didn\'t use it.  Life insurance is rather cut and dried that way.  But, uh, no, you don\'t get back the money you put into it because you didn\'t use it. That\'s how insurance works. Yes, really.  Yes, really, like your car, or like your house. You don\'t get your money back if they didn\'t get damaged in the last year, do you? We wouldn\'t make a profit that way.  No, it\'s not a scam, I promise. No, this isn\'t illegal.  Yes, I\'m really really sure. Oh? You aren\'t going to use our company next time?  What exactly do you picture the ""next time"" being?*\n\nI\'m sure I could think of more too.  If I do, and you liked these, I\'ll be sure to post them.  Also, if you have any questions, feel free to ask, while some of this stuff varies by area, most of the important parts are the same or very close to it everywhere.

center at a VA hospital. When a veteran calls in, we have to ask for their last name and last 4 of their social security number in order to verify that it’s actually them since there are an incredible number of vets with the same last name. Pretty standard across all VA hospitals in the U.S. The vast majority of the vets that call in don’t have a problem with this. This is a story of one who did.\n\nMe: Thank you for calling the ___ VA. This is Gwent4Life. How may I help you?\n\n(I worked in the specialty center which housed the orthopedic, podiatry, ENT, surgical, dental, etc. You get the picture.)\n\nVet: I need to speak to Dr. ____. (Head of the clinic).\n\nMe: Okay. Did he call you directly?\n\nVet: No! Just let me talk to him! \n\n(Guy was already getting angry and the call just started.)\n\nMe: Okay. What’s your name sir?\n\nVet: (Gives first name).\n\nMe: Okay. What’s your last name?\n\nVet: You don’t need to know! Just get me Dr. ___!\n\n(Guy is yelling into the phone at this point.)\n\nMe: (In a calm voice) Well I kinda need t know who is calling for Dr. ____ as it is something that the doctors like to know. \n\nVet: I don’t fucking care! Just give me Dr ____. \n\nMe: Sir, I must ask you refrain from cussing or else I’ll have to terminate the call. Now please, tell me your last name and I can see what I can do.\n\nVet: I ain’t giving you shit! If you ain’t going to help me, then you can fuck off!\n\n*click*\n\nI laugh a little to myself and with my coworkers. Then the phone rings again. I got the same guy again. At this point I make a mental note of the phone number. \n\nMe: Thank you for calling ____ VA. This is Gwent4Life, how may I help you?\n\nVet: Get me Dr. ____!\n\nMe: (knowing it’s the same guy) Ok sir. What’s your name and last 4?\n\nVet: You’re not getting shit from me, just be a good little boy and get me the fucking doctor!\n\nMe: I’m sorry sir, but I have to know who is calling in order to inform the doctor. \n\nVet: This is going fucking nowhere! Fuck you!\n\n*click*\n\nI tell my coworkers he called again and hung up a second time. We laugh a bit and I tell them to forward me the number if they see it.\n\nMy coworkers phone rings, and he says it’s the same guy. I tell him to forward it to me.\n\nMe: Thank you for calling the _____ VA. This is Gwent4Life, how may I help you?\n\nSilence. For only a couple seconds but felt like longer.\n\nMe: Hello? Is anyone there? (In my kindest, sweetest voice)\n\nVet: long pronounced sigh.\n\n*click*\n\nThis happened at the end of the day.

When a veteran calls in, we have to ask for their last name and last 4 of their social security number in order to verify that it’s actually them since there are an incredible number of vets with the same last name. Pretty standard across all VA hospitals in the U.S. The vast majority of the vets that call in don’t have a problem with this. This is a story of one who did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Thank you for calling the ___ VA. This is Gwent4Life. How may I help you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I worked in the specialty center which housed the orthopedic, podiatry, ENT, surgical, dental, etc. You get the picture.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vet: I need to speak to Dr. ____. (Head of the clinic).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay. Did he call you directly?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vet: No! Just let me talk to him! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Guy was already getting angry and the call just started.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay. What’s your name sir?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vet: (Gives first name).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay. What’s your last name?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vet: You don’t need to know! Just get me Dr. ___!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Guy is yelling into the phone at this point.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: (In a calm voice) Well I kinda need t know who is calling for Dr. ____ as it is something that the doctors like to know. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vet: I don’t fucking care! Just give me Dr ____. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Sir, I must ask you refrain from cussing or else I’ll have to terminate the call. Now please, tell me your last name and I can see what I can do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vet: I ain’t giving you shit! If you ain’t going to help me, then you can fuck off!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I laugh a little to myself and with my coworkers. Then the phone rings again. I got the same guy again. At this point I make a mental note of the phone number. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Thank you for calling ____ VA. This is Gwent4Life, how may I help you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vet: Get me Dr. ____!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: (knowing it’s the same guy) Ok sir.

We laugh a bit and I tell them to forward me the number if they see it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My coworkers phone rings, and he says it’s the same guy. I tell him to forward it to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Thank you for calling the _____ VA. This is Gwent4Life, how may I help you?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence.

On the one hand, it&amp;#39;s infuriating, because we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have a note on that page about how to get past that; but on the other hand, I like it because it means you have to ring me, and that means I have a job!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;_ - - Customer had another breathless laugh, agreed that it was good that I had a job, and said she hoped I had a lovely afternoon &amp;#39;without too many silly old ladies like her.&amp;#39; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I assured her that she wasn&amp;#39;t silly, but the website was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a nice moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The call started with her being ... &lt;em&gt;absolutely ... disgusted&lt;/em&gt;

Hope you enjoy!\n\nThese days I\'m a math tutor, and when my kids ask how ""real world situations"" are ever solved with math like in their textbook problems, I bring up this story.\n\nThe Theme Park Company I worked for had a lot of metrics we had to follow that ranged from bonkers to stupid, but one of the more lenient ones was the ""Sign In"" metric.\n\nIn short, they acknowledged that we couldn\'t be on the phone literally every minute of the day. Sometimes a call ran over, sometimes there were technical issues, sometimes people needed an extra potty break, or a trip to the water cooler, etc. (Team meetings, time with our team leaders, official breaks etc didn\'t count). So the company had a little line on our dashboard that showed how many hours we were scheduled vs how many we were on the phones, and calculated the percentage. So long as the line read 95% or higher, no red flags.\n\nSeems like a lot, right? No real time for any extra breaks, maybe a minute here and there.\n\nExcept......math time!\n\nOn average in a month, I worked about 200 hours, doing 10 hour shifts 4 - 5 days per week. Know what 95% of 200 is? 10! A whole 10 hour shift! I literally could not take a single call on the last day of the month and STILL be at 95% sign in. And if I worked a lot of OT, I could do more!\n\nAs soon as I realized this, the last day of the month became my favorite day. I still had to show up, sign in and take one or two calls, just so no one wondered why I wasn\'t on at all. But in between that? I read a book, sat in the break room watching tv and played on my laptop all day.\n\nA few people started asking how I was goofing off so much. I told them I had some extra time to burn off my sign in. They were shocked to realize how much free time they had. The next month I had a few people asking me to look at their dashboard and calculate their ""sign in surplus."" Another month after that, almost two dozen people had me helping to calculate their numbers.

Hope you enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These days I&amp;#39;m a math tutor, and when my kids ask how &amp;quot;real world situations&amp;quot; are ever solved with math like in their textbook problems, I bring up this story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Theme Park Company I worked for had a lot of metrics we had to follow that ranged from bonkers to stupid, but one of the more lenient ones was the &amp;quot;Sign In&amp;quot; metric.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short, they acknowledged that we couldn&amp;#39;t be on the phone literally every minute of the day. Sometimes a call ran over, sometimes there were technical issues, sometimes people needed an extra potty break, or a trip to the water cooler, etc. (Team meetings, time with our team leaders, official breaks etc didn&amp;#39;t count). So the company had a little line on our dashboard that showed how many hours we were scheduled vs how many we were on the phones, and calculated the percentage. So long as the line read 95% or higher, no red flags.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seems like a lot, right? No real time for any extra breaks, maybe a minute here and there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Except......math time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On average in a month, I worked about 200 hours, doing 10 hour shifts 4 - 5 days per week. Know what 95% of 200 is? 10! A whole 10 hour shift! I literally could not take a single call on the last day of the month and STILL be at 95% sign in. And if I worked a lot of OT, I could do more!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as I realized this, the last day of the month became my favorite day. I still had to show up, sign in and take one or two calls, just so no one wondered why I wasn&amp;#39;t on at all. But in between that? I read a book, sat in the break room watching tv and played on my laptop all day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few people started asking how I was goofing off so much. I told them I had some extra time to burn off my sign in. They were shocked to realize how much free time they had. The next month I had a few people asking me to look at their dashboard and calculate their &amp;quot;sign in surplus.&amp;quot; Another month after that, almost two dozen people had me helping to calculate their numbers. I had almost two teams worth of people de-stressing on the last day of the month instead of worrying about their metrics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all got a day off if we wanted it, we didn&amp;#39;t have to worry about metric issues and we got to skip the last day of a month, which wasn&amp;#39;t usually good for sales (or could hurt your average and therefore commission if you got a bunch of small calls) without muss or fuss.

I figured I\'d share with you. I work in emergency roadside assistance (ERS). There are many situations that we don\'t cover. Also, I had posted this the day it happened and just copy and pasted from the old post so while I did my best to update the text, if I mention something about it happening today or yesterday, I just forgot to change it.\n\nOne situation we can\'t tow you is if your registration/tag/plates are expired. Well we had a member, about a year ago, that called for service and when the driver got there the tags had expired in July of 2010. So, the driver told the member we couldn\'t tow it and left. (Customer was at his house btw so not in a dangerous situation) Well I got a call from the garage (We call tow companies garages) about a call on their board. It was this member again. He had placed another call through. And also the tow destination was going to a storage facility which we dont tow to because that usually means the member is just going to store their vehicle and doesn\'t want to have to pay for a tow truck so calls us.\n\nWell I called this member and ask about the tags. He said that he told the driver that he had the tags and he just had to get them from his house and they\'re on the vehicle now. I then told him that we can\'t tow to storage facilities. The guy gets a little huffy and says that it\'s going to a repair shop that is behind the storage facility and storage place is the only building with an address. Okay fine. I tell him that we\'ll tow it but the driver isnt going anywhere within the storage property and will only drop the vehicle in the repair shops lot and not outside the gates of the storage facility like he had suggested.\n\nSo I call the garage back to give them the go ahead and they say that the guy had 2 different plates for the vehicle and isnt that illegal? What?? They didn\'t say anything about that the first time. So I call the member back AGAIN and say ""Oh and I forgot to mention, but when the driver arrives you\'ll need to show him the registration for the vehicle."" This is so we can match it with the VIN on the car and verify the tags are the legal tags and not tags he took off of some other vehicle.\n\nWell this guy gets upset and starts rambling on about how he\'s been a member for 12 years and he\'s never had this much trouble ect, ect. Then he goes on to say that while he was putting the tags on, he fell and broke his hip and is waiting for an ambulance because of us and is probably going to cancel his membership. Ummm what??\n\nFirst, Ive never broken a hip before but I know people that have and it\'s painful. He said it so matter factly and didn\'t sound to be in any pain. He said it in a way that made me think he thought that I would suddenly want to do damage control and say nevermind to the registration. And he made it seem like the ambulance wasn\'t coming right away. Overall he was just being a total jerk and I was certain he was lying but couldn\'t call him out on it.\n\nSo anyway I hang up with him and call the garage back and tell them what he said about how he supposedly broke his hip, is waiting for an ambulance and will have the registration. So less than an hour goes by and my coworker tells me that the garage is on the phone and wants to talk to me personally. Turns out the same driver that went there before gets to location again and the member pulls up and gives him the registration....for the vehicle he just drove there in. So the driver goes over to the vehicle needing towed and compares VINs (He did this just to cover his butt) and sure enough they dont match. So he left and called his dispatcher who then called me to let me know.\n\nSo I call the member one last time and let him know that because the registration didnt match, he\'s not getting towed.

I figured I&amp;#39;d share with you. I work in emergency roadside assistance (ERS). There are many situations that we don&amp;#39;t cover. Also, I had posted this the day it happened and just copy and pasted from the old post so while I did my best to update the text, if I mention something about it happening today or yesterday, I just forgot to change it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One situation we can&amp;#39;t tow you is if your registration/tag/plates are expired. Well we had a member, about a year ago, that called for service and when the driver got there the tags had expired in July of 2010. So, the driver told the member we couldn&amp;#39;t tow it and left. (Customer was at his house btw so not in a dangerous situation) Well I got a call from the garage (We call tow companies garages) about a call on their board. It was this member again. He had placed another call through. And also the tow destination was going to a storage facility which we dont tow to because that usually means the member is just going to store their vehicle and doesn&amp;#39;t want to have to pay for a tow truck so calls us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well I called this member and ask about the tags. He said that he told the driver that he had the tags and he just had to get them from his house and they&amp;#39;re on the vehicle now. I then told him that we can&amp;#39;t tow to storage facilities. The guy gets a little huffy and says that it&amp;#39;s going to a repair shop that is behind the storage facility and storage place is the only building with an address. Okay fine. I tell him that we&amp;#39;ll tow it but the driver isnt going anywhere within the storage property and will only drop the vehicle in the repair shops lot and not outside the gates of the storage facility like he had suggested.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I call the garage back to give them the go ahead and they say that the guy had 2 different plates for the vehicle and isnt that illegal? What?? They didn&amp;#39;t say anything about that the first time. So I call the member back AGAIN and say &amp;quot;Oh and I forgot to mention, but when the driver arrives you&amp;#39;ll need to show him the registration for the vehicle.&amp;quot; This is so we can match it with the VIN on the car and verify the tags are the legal tags and not tags he took off of some other vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well this guy gets upset and starts rambling on about how he&amp;#39;s been a member for 12 years and he&amp;#39;s never had this much trouble ect, ect. Then he goes on to say that while he was putting the tags on, he fell and broke his hip and is waiting for an ambulance because of us and is probably going to cancel his membership. Ummm what??&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, Ive never broken a hip before but I know people that have and it&amp;#39;s painful. He said it so matter factly and didn&amp;#39;t sound to be in any pain. He said it in a way that made me think he thought that I would suddenly want to do damage control and say nevermind to the registration. And he made it seem like the ambulance wasn&amp;#39;t coming right away. Overall he was just being a total jerk and I was certain he was lying but couldn&amp;#39;t call him out on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So anyway I hang up with him and call the garage back and tell them what he said about how he supposedly broke his hip, is waiting for an ambulance and will have the registration. So less than an hour goes by and my coworker tells me that the garage is on the phone and wants to talk to me personally. Turns out the same driver that went there before gets to location again and the member pulls up and gives him the registration....for the vehicle he just drove there in. So the driver goes over to the vehicle needing towed and compares VINs (He did this just to cover his butt) and sure enough they dont match. So he left and called his dispatcher who then called me to let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I call the member one last time and let him know that because the registration didnt match, he&amp;#39;s not getting towed. Well he was not happy and started bitching again about how he doesn&amp;#39;t care what we say, we towed his $60,000 vehicle to a storage facility in the past so he doesnt understand why it&amp;#39;s suddenly a problem (so basically he just admitted he was planning on storing the vehicle) and how he&amp;#39;s gonna cancel his membership and he broke his hip (he didnt.

Our company used music from its theme parks and movies and other pop music projects, so that was in our ear nonstop while we waited.\n\nBut it got worse.....\n\nThe hold music system was glitching. We would hear the ""beginning"" of the track and the opening song. A jaunty tune that was meant to get you happy. It lasted only twenty seconds before going into a pop song. A pop song the company had sent into ""way overplayed"" status long before this. It would get about 80% of the way through the song, then suddenly stop, making my OCD alarms go off like mad.

that is a bit more positive. \n\n\nFor background, I currently work at a large bank and I have worked in various roles in Fraud, Credit Risk, Underwriting and Sales. This story comes from sales. My job was essentially filling out applications over the phone for the company\'s credit card. \n\n\nI was feeling pretty good. I was freshly caffeinated and had just started my first 3:00p-12:00a shift. Around 10:00p I got a call from a very sad-sounding gentleman who told me he needed a credit card to finance repairs to his motorcycle. We found him a good deal that\'d work out for him where he wouldn\'t have any interest for roughly 18 months and he\'d also get a decent amount of rewards out of it too. \n\n\nOver the course of the call, he opened up about how he bought the motorcycle after his wife had passed away from cancer. He said that they\'d always talked about doing a cross country road trip since neither had left the state before.\n\n\nHe told me how he cared for the motorcycle like it was worth a million bucks and how he washed it every time he stopped in case his wife was watching down on him as he made his journey across the country. Eventually, the motorcycle broke down about 3/4 the way to his destination and he didn\'t have the cash to fix it. I asked him how much he needed and he said it\'d roughly be about $1,500. \n\n\nI don\'t know much about motorcycles, but I tried to ask questions to keep the conversation going because you could hear in his voice that even just talking about it made him happy. Plus I had time to kill while we ran his credit. The dude could probably talk for hours about it if I let him.\n\n\nThe application came back approved, but only for $1,200. Not enough.

This story comes from sales. My job was essentially filling out applications over the phone for the company&amp;#39;s credit card. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was feeling pretty good. I was freshly caffeinated and had just started my first 3:00p-12:00a shift. Around 10:00p I got a call from a very sad-sounding gentleman who told me he needed a credit card to finance repairs to his motorcycle. We found him a good deal that&amp;#39;d work out for him where he wouldn&amp;#39;t have any interest for roughly 18 months and he&amp;#39;d also get a decent amount of rewards out of it too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the call, he opened up about how he bought the motorcycle after his wife had passed away from cancer. He said that they&amp;#39;d always talked about doing a cross country road trip since neither had left the state before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He told me how he cared for the motorcycle like it was worth a million bucks and how he washed it every time he stopped in case his wife was watching down on him as he made his journey across the country. Eventually, the motorcycle broke down about 3/4 the way to his destination and he didn&amp;#39;t have the cash to fix it. I asked him how much he needed and he said it&amp;#39;d roughly be about $1,500. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know much about motorcycles, but I tried to ask questions to keep the conversation going because you could hear in his voice that even just talking about it made him happy. Plus I had time to kill while we ran his credit. The dude could probably talk for hours about it if I let him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The application came back approved, but only for $1,200. Not enough. Now, if a customer wasn&amp;#39;t satisfied with that amount, we can do some math and possibly increase it a bit. I asked him again how much it&amp;#39;d be and he said &amp;quot;Oh about $1,500, but a little more would be nice so I can have some wiggle room in case I need it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I did that math, offered him $2,000 instead and he was ecstatic.

My team leader had been called into a conference room with all six Vice Presidents from my call center as well as our second call center, and they decided to listen to a call from her team to see how she was doing as a leader. Guess who they were listening to.\n\nAbout fifteen minutes after the call ended, my leader (who was normally sweet as sugar) stormed to my cubicle and yanked me into her office. She told me what happened, and apparently when I said ""I just don\'t care"" all 6 VPs flipped out, pearls tightly clutched, and faces white. My leader had never seen them so terrified. I explained I had to stop her from freaking out. She goes, ""Yeah, NOT LIKE THAT! I want you to know, they said the ONLY reason you aren\'t fired is because she purchased and was happy in the end. Please don\'t ever scare me like that again!""\n\nThankfully this had a true happy ending.

The Creep— This gentleman called and started giving me relaxation, breathing exercises and toe curling (?) techniques. Wouldn’t tell me what I could help him with, until I insisted FIRMLY. After helping him sort something in his account, he kept being all creepy. Followed by a “Thanks for the tips, I’m at work right now sk I’ll try those later. Thank you for calling X, you have a nice day. \n\n4-4. The Quadruple Dipper— This man called about 3-4 times, I know because when I said it in the company chat, other people came out and said they’d gotten him before me. He proceeded to say I was stupid and an idiot repeatedly right after my greeting.  Did I mispronounce something? I dont think so? Every question was answered with how much of an idiot I was and how I was stupid. Simply said my closings, and hung up. \n\n3-3. The Banshee’s Cousin— This lady called in and once asked to confirm her address, freaked out. A name and an account number does not cut it, since we send out a card that contain both, anyone could find the card, call in and pretend they’re the customer. So she began saying “Why are you asking me that? You have it in front of you?!” In a shrieking, almost deafening tone. To which my reply always remained more or less the same “It’s part of my job to confirm your address, the account number is not personal information, therefore it cannot be used to confirm your identity”. At one point, she paused, and I spoke, answering to her question, but apparently she wasn’t done, and when she started speaking again, the words had already left my mouth. This set her off even more: “WHY ARE YOU TALKING OVER ME?” To which my response is the truth “I apologize ma’am. Our phones lag sometimes and-“ “WELL WE PAY YOU ENOUGH TO GET BETTER PHONES!” This carried on and when she noticed I was not giving in, she proceeded to what I can only describe as putting the phone down and ignoring me? I said “Ma’am” multiple times in an effort to try and salvage the call, which ended in me stating That I was going to terminate the call, since I could not hear anyone on the other side, I had to still say my closing, but she grabbed the phone and clicked it off.  Can’t say I was mad she hung up. \n\n2-2. The Banshee— This lady called to state we were going to stop sending her so much mail. Of course I can help! I have a way of-NO MORE MAIL. Oh shit what happened there? Oh yes. She interrupted me. Just like that. I proceded to let her know that I had a way of making her receive just one letter-Aaaaand cut off again. “YES. JUST ONE LETTER”-she shrieked. I responded by saying “Ma’am, I need to read you this statement about how this is going to work.”  To which she said “Go ahead.” So I proceed to explain it once again: one letter when your account will expire, and if you have an email- “NOPE. NO EMAILS JUST A LETTER. ARE YOU CONFUSED OR SOMETHING?” This time I proceed to finish my statement-“an email will be sent as well, if the account expires, we will send a letter a month letter to let you know.”  She kept shrieking in what I can only assume was the Karen-est voice I have ever heard “I don’t care. You WILL stop sending me mail. YOU are GOING TO DO THAT AND I AM HANGING UP NOW.” I started another statement about how if she hangs up, I cant make any changes to her account beca-click. Oh, she hung up. Well, I can’t make changes in any account without the caller on the line. So guess who’s still receiving mail?\n\n1-1. The Short Fuse— this man? Calls in, right after my greeting, starts asking me?/stating: “Are your agents-if your agents-I have been hung up on now TWICE, IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE TRAINED TO DO?!” I apologize, and offer my help, once again “I am so sorry sir, how can I help?” He’s not having it! “THIS IS THE SECOND TIME YOU ASK ME THAT AND YOU HAVE TO ANSWER MY QUESTION! Is that what you do?!” At this point he was yelling at the top of his lungs, and my hands were shaking uncontrollably. I let out a sigh, whithout noticing I hadn’t muted my mic, which meant...he’d heard me sigh into the mic. “WHAT WAS THAT? WHAT WAS THAT NOISE YOU JUST MADE?!....” he’s still screaming for a good 45 seconds straight after I muted myself to tell my Sup I was hanging up and gather their phone number to get them blacklisted. When I came back, He had finally shut up and was waiting a response from me from a “ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME OR NOT”, I unmute myself and barely get to say “Sir..” before he bursts out into yelling again, at this point I’m not even hearing words, so I state “Sir, In order for me to assist you I need for you to lower your voice and keep the conversation professional”, he never stopped yelling. I could HEAR the vein in his forehead about to pop. So I said my closing statement, and stated I was ending the call. Apparently, he HAD been hung up on before, because he kept yelling at other representatives and not let them try to assist. \n\nI ask myself every day, do these people understand that, we WILL keep dropping their calls, they wil NEVER get help or sort their problems out if they keep abusing the representatives? If you don’t corroborate your info, we can’t help, if you verbally abuse us, we WILL NOT help, and no matter how many times you call, you WILL be dropped. And eventually, your phone number will be sent to the Big Dick Bosses to blacklist. And then you will lose the service you liked, because you decided to be a raging pos. :) so Thank you for calling, and have a nice day, asshole.\n\n\nEdit: had to mess with the numbers because reddit fixed them to keep going up instead of 5,4,3,2,1', 'author_fullname': 't2_1n1zdatk', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'These weeks Irate Callers, Sorted!', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/talesfromcallcenters', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'long', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_j7rptq', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 1.0, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 44, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'L', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 44, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': 1602214276.0, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1602242680.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.talesfromcallcenters', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week has been a stressful one.

I responded by saying “Ma’am, I need to read you this statement about how this is going to work.”  To which she said “Go ahead.” So I proceed to explain it once again: one letter when your account will expire, and if you have an email- “NOPE. NO EMAILS JUST A LETTER. ARE YOU CONFUSED OR SOMETHING?” This time I proceed to finish my statement-“an email will be sent as well, if the account expires, we will send a letter a month letter to let you know.”  She kept shrieking in what I can only assume was the Karen-est voice I have ever heard “I don’t care. You WILL stop sending me mail. YOU are GOING TO DO THAT AND I AM HANGING UP NOW.” I started another statement about how if she hangs up, I cant make any changes to her account beca-click. Oh, she hung up. Well, I can’t make changes in any account without the caller on the line. So guess who’s still receiving mail?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1-1. The Short Fuse— this man? Calls in, right after my greeting, starts asking me?/stating: “Are your agents-if your agents-I have been hung up on now TWICE, IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE TRAINED TO DO?!” I apologize, and offer my help, once again “I am so sorry sir, how can I help?” He’s not having it! “THIS IS THE SECOND TIME YOU ASK ME THAT AND YOU HAVE TO ANSWER MY QUESTION! Is that what you do?!” At this point he was yelling at the top of his lungs, and my hands were shaking uncontrollably. I let out a sigh, whithout noticing I hadn’t muted my mic, which meant...he’d heard me sigh into the mic. “WHAT WAS THAT? WHAT WAS THAT NOISE YOU JUST MADE?!....” he’s still screaming for a good 45 seconds straight after I muted myself to tell my Sup I was hanging up and gather their phone number to get them blacklisted. When I came back, He had finally shut up and was waiting a response from me from a “ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME OR NOT”, I unmute myself and barely get to say “Sir..” before he bursts out into yelling again, at this point I’m not even hearing words, so I state “Sir, In order for me to assist you I need for you to lower your voice and keep the conversation professional”, he never stopped yelling. I could HEAR the vein in his forehead about to pop. So I said my closing statement, and stated I was ending the call. Apparently, he HAD been hung up on before, because he kept yelling at other representatives and not let them try to assist. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ask myself every day, do these people understand that, we WILL keep dropping their calls, they wil NEVER get help or sort their problems out if they keep abusing the representatives? If you don’t corroborate your info, we can’t help, if you verbally abuse us, we WILL NOT help, and no matter how many times you call, you WILL be dropped. And eventually, your phone number will be sent to the Big Dick Bosses to blacklist. And then you will lose the service you liked, because you decided to be a raging pos. :) so Thank you for calling, and have a nice day, asshole.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: had to mess with the numbers because reddit fixed them to keep going up instead of 5,4,3,2,1&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2urem', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'j7rptq', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'prettyinpinkleather', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 5, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/j7rptq/these_weeks_irate_callers_sorted/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/j7rptq/these_weeks_irate_callers_sorted/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 208602, 'created_utc': 1602213880.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'talesfromcallcenters', 'selftext': 'This dude didn’t even bother to try to mask his voice, his profile populated with his own account, boldfaced lied that his name was (equivalent name) Lisa White.

She would make hundreds of calls a year to ask us the exact same question. \n\nThe question she wanted to know was when her bank statement would come in. Now keep in mind that we had monthly statements that was sent out to everybody, she never knew what month of the statement that she wanted, and when would tell her that a copy was already sent out, she would tell at us that we didn't because she never received it, and hang up. \n\nThe other huge issue we had with her was she was elderly, super confrontational to the point of it almost seeming like a joke, racist to certain members of the bank, and she most likely had dementia.

One day she was yelling at us, the next day not a peep from her. It was heaven. The next day she didn't call in, and the day after that, and the day after that, and on and on. We didn't hear from her for over 8 months. Some had forgot about her, some thought she was moved into a home away from a phone, and some thought she died.

I’m tired of the technicians that work with us not answering there phone and not being reliable. What type of technicians go to someone’s house and doesn’t send us a diagnosis for weeks or just go ghost on the customers and us? Then the customers get on the phone yelling at me because of technician is not answering. But when they do answer, it’s a high chance they are rude, unprofessional or confused. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The technicians are just a percentage of why this job is a nightmare. Every customer is angry. Out of 150 calls per day with customers, 25 don’t have attitudes, rude, or yelling. I had enough. The last few days my performance has been horrible and I have been giving the energy they give me back to them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You want to cancel? “Let me transfer you to retention”. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asking me the same question after I told you several times? “What don’t you understand? Did you not hear me the first time sir/mam? Like I said...!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We never cover anything and we are a scam? “Well didn’t you read the policy you bought?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Raising your voice at me? I’ll yell back. I DON’T CARE! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last straw was with one guy. Every customer ask for a supervisor when they don’t like the rules, but we are not allowed to transfer or put in a request if it’s not a valid reason or reason is clearly stated in the policy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Thank you for calling ... May I have your address?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customer: I need to speak to a supervisor. Last person said they would transfer me and hung up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Um, well I would have to pull your account up first and look into your request? ...... Thank you, and what’s the reason you would like to speak to a supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customer: I want to speak to a supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Like I said, I would need to have a reason for-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customer: I don’t have to explain anything to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(As I look into his account, claim was denied. Reason stated in policy.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Well if you are referring to the claim that was denied you put in, you would have to submit an appeal- &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customer: That’s not what I’m calling for, I need to speak to a supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Ok, well your not speaking to a supervisor. I’m not able to transfer you. Is there anything else I can help you with. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customer: So your telling me I can’t speak to a supervisor? What do you mean your not able to, the other rep said they would. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Well did they transfer you? ... No. The managers are busy, I’ll put in a request for a call back. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customer: I don’t want a call back. How hard is it to get up and put the phone to the Supervisors ear?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: We are actually working from home so that’s not possible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customer: Well I’m not getting off the phone until there’s a supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Like I said I-... you know what? I get a you over to a manager right now, one moment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Customer: Yeah you bett-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;em&gt;I hung up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never working for a call center again.

For that , please give me your company name and your name, please.&amp;quot; In the sweetest, most inoffensive voice I could muster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: &amp;quot;hrmpf OK.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She then starts rattling down her company name, her name and the problem and I dutifully typed it in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then it came:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her:  You type pretty fast....&lt;strong&gt;for a man&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh how I&amp;#39;ve waited for a line like that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &amp;quot;Why, thank you! But that&amp;#39;s slow. I was a lot faster before my 12-month paternity leave&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My colleagues, who were by then listening in to my half of the conversation, had to stifle a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But You. Could. Hear. A. Pin Drop. on the other side of the line (the sound her jaw made when it dropped to the floor was positively ear-shattering). A guy taking care of the kid did not fit into her view of the world at all!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her: [Stammering] Uhm.. OK.. Congratulations then! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And she suddenly was so much friendlier than before. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The phone call wrapped up shortly after that. I gave her some first-aid tips based on the issue she described, asked for some files to be emailed to us and hung up.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned to my female colleagues and told them, that  now, for the first time ever, I really, really understand how annoying those calls can be (and then went to get myself a well-deserved coffee)!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 100, 'id': 'award_74fe5152-7906-4991-9016-bc2d8e261200', 'penny_donate': 0, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'coin_reward': 0, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/x069ow7ewnf51_Excited.png', 'days_of_premium': 0, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/x069ow7ewnf51_Excited.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=094da86916604f4fc9f7f63c827e31c976f00928', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/x069ow7ewnf51_Excited.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52886a42b9871ec69a4465609472a864dbab27b1', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/x069ow7ewnf51_Excited.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63a8f5eff627778a221c58daffbfbbb87b7fe350', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/x069ow7ewnf51_Excited.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da0d9de08517646db45b766dbb0e7b94d2e97312', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/x069ow7ewnf51_Excited.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d3501a4314be9d47349a1f7925e18f30a832e5', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 2048, 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': False, 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'description': ""I don't know what to do with my hands!"", 'end_date': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'count': 1, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'name': 'Excited', 'resized_static_icons': [{'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/x069ow7ewnf51_Excited.png?width=16&amp;height=16&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=094da86916604f4fc9f7f63c827e31c976f00928', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/x069ow7ewnf51_Excited.png?width=32&amp;height=32&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52886a42b9871ec69a4465609472a864dbab27b1', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/x069ow7ewnf51_Excited.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63a8f5eff627778a221c58daffbfbbb87b7fe350', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/x069ow7ewnf51_Excited.png?width=64&amp;height=64&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da0d9de08517646db45b766dbb0e7b94d2e97312', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/x069ow7ewnf51_Excited.png?width=128&amp;height=128&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58d3501a4314be9d47349a1f7925e18f30a832e5', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_format': 'PNG', 'icon_height': 2048, 'penny_price': 0, 'award_type': 'global', 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/x069ow7ewnf51_Excited.png'}], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2urem', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'j65aiy', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'JimLongbow', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 87, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/j65aiy/put_me_through_to_one_of_your_female_colleagues/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/j65aiy/put_me_through_to_one_of_your_female_colleagues/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 208602, 'created_utc': 1601991876.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'talesfromcallcenters', 'selftext': ""Me = Me, of course lol\n\nCx = Customer (the wife)\n\nRet = Retentions Department\n\nBil = Billing Department\n\n==================\n\nMe: Hello, you're through to BEEP company.

He thinks we\'re charging him more because we don\'t have correct information on the policy, so we can\'t verify his license number.\n\nMe (Reviewing policy): The information that he filled in when he purchased this policy online? I mean, sure we can correct it. But I can\'t guarantee that it\'ll be cheaper when corrected.\n\nWhile I\'m reviewing, I discover a second policy. One where SS was added to the policy by our claims department. SS had been added onto his parents\' policy. On his own policy, SS had put in the wrong date of birth, the wrong issuing state for his license (but the right number!), the wrong zip code (but right address), and had left off all other household family members, including some who operated the insured vehicle. Oh, and the parents\' policy had cancelled with a balance owing of over $2,000.\n\n(Important nugget: Most insurance companies require that you include everybody in the household of driving age on the policy. Theoretically, there\'s access to the vehicles in the household. And even if you\'ve never driven a day in your life, you may still have coverage rights under the policy by virtue of being a resident relative. This can vary by carrier, and policy contracts may address this differently among carriers.)\n\nRep comes back and states the customer wants to change the date of birth and license state. He will not consent to the update in the address. She runs it and we are looking at an increase of over $4,000 to the term. Turns out SS had the kind of driving record that begs for exclusive use of public transportation.\n\nMe: You sure he\'s going to be okay with this amount and this change, Rep?\n\nRep: Yeah, he\'s being really cool about it.\n\nI don\'t smell a rat; I smell a full outhouse next to the beach during low tide. I make a mental note to follow up on the policy for the next three weeks. Because the insured had refused to update the address, this was an automatic referral to Underwriting, anyways.\n\nLo and behold, I check on the policy for the first time the next day. The customer has purchased a ***third*** policy with all the wrong information input. The rate is on par with his pre-corrected rate. He had purchased it online while on the phone with my rep, then called back two hours later to cancel the new policy.\n\nOne of my pet peeves is insurance fraud/material misrepresentation. I really hate when they do it repeatedly. Not that I don\'t appreciate the attempts at giving me job security, but insurance fraud is something that hurts EVERYBODY.\n\nI ended up having to kick this up to Underwriting\'s management. They didn\'t mess around; SS got the ""Don\'t let the door hit you on your way out, and don\'t bother coming back"" notice three days later. He didn\'t even bother calling us back.

Turns out SS had the kind of driving record that begs for exclusive use of public transportation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: You sure he&amp;#39;s going to be okay with this amount and this change, Rep?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rep: Yeah, he&amp;#39;s being really cool about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t smell a rat; I smell a full outhouse next to the beach during low tide. I make a mental note to follow up on the policy for the next three weeks. Because the insured had refused to update the address, this was an automatic referral to Underwriting, anyways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, I check on the policy for the first time the next day. The customer has purchased a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;third&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; policy with all the wrong information input. The rate is on par with his pre-corrected rate. He had purchased it online while on the phone with my rep, then called back two hours later to cancel the new policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of my pet peeves is insurance fraud/material misrepresentation. I really hate when they do it repeatedly. Not that I don&amp;#39;t appreciate the attempts at giving me job security, but insurance fraud is something that hurts EVERYBODY.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up having to kick this up to Underwriting&amp;#39;s management. They didn&amp;#39;t mess around; SS got the &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t let the door hit you on your way out, and don&amp;#39;t bother coming back&amp;quot; notice three days later. He didn&amp;#39;t even bother calling us back.

Not my department, but sure, I’ll look. No tech visit scheduled. I tell her I’m going to take a look at the notes real quick. \n\nOMG. There are so many notes from yesterday. The whole time she’s shouting at me about her issues. I’m trying to listen to her and read these notes. What I’m reading is insane. Basically her TV wasn’t working right so she had to call a technician because she refused to unplug her TV box and try even the slightest amount of troubleshooting over the phone. Then when the tech shows up he sees a gun on her table. Okay, not illegal, but not making anyone comfortable either. So he’s taking a look at it and I guess texts his supervisor about the situation. His supervisor tells him to leave. He let’s her know that he has to go because of this. She grabs the gun and starts threatening him to fix her TV box. He leaves quickly. So she starts calling and telling the people she’s getting on the phone a totally different story, our security team gets involved and locks her account. \n\nSo I ask her what happened and if security has reached out to her. She is not admitting anything. Finally I had to say “ma’am, did you point a gun at the technician? Because that’s why we can’t send anyone.” She goes “oh that? Everyone here has guns, I don’t know what his problem is. I need my tv box fixed. I pay you people so much money each month and he just left without doing anything.” No shit lady. Most people don’t want to potentially be shot while at work. She then starts going on about her friend is going to come over and they are going to start a war. And then she’s telling me her friend took all her guns so I need to send someone out. Nope, can’t do that. \n\nI ended up just reaching out to a sup and telling her I need her to take over this call.

The rig was designed to be airline friendly so it could travel as checked luggage. The main rig case was just under 70 lbs, one of the airline cutoff weights.\n\nI was slated to fly from SFO to Vancouver BC, pick up the system and then fly to Toronto. There was an airline we always used because they are Media Friendly. i.e. we paid $50 per bag no matter the weight, size or how many. That is way cheaper than shipping. They just had to meet airline regulations for max size and be under 100lbs.\n\nThe leg of the trip from Vancouver to Toronto was to be on a partner airline instead of the usual airline. Hmmm, I check their bag policies and see some trouble coming.  I call their call center and get a wonderful Canadian agent. After going over the issue I learn that the rampies for that airline won\'t touch anything over 50lbs in Toronto. We both agreed I can\'t fly with them and I had to cancel the reservation.\n\nI then tell her that I\'m not real familiar with the various airlines that go across Canada and is there another airline that does the Van - Toronto route.\n\nShe responded with, ""I\'m sorry but it is the policy of Big Airline Company to not tell customers about Other Smaller Airline.""\n\nI thanked her and rang off.

The rig was designed to be airline friendly so it could travel as checked luggage. The main rig case was just under 70 lbs, one of the airline cutoff weights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was slated to fly from SFO to Vancouver BC, pick up the system and then fly to Toronto. There was an airline we always used because they are Media Friendly. i.e. we paid $50 per bag no matter the weight, size or how many. That is way cheaper than shipping. They just had to meet airline regulations for max size and be under 100lbs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The leg of the trip from Vancouver to Toronto was to be on a partner airline instead of the usual airline. Hmmm, I check their bag policies and see some trouble coming.  I call their call center and get a wonderful Canadian agent. After going over the issue I learn that the rampies for that airline won&amp;#39;t touch anything over 50lbs in Toronto. We both agreed I can&amp;#39;t fly with them and I had to cancel the reservation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I then tell her that I&amp;#39;m not real familiar with the various airlines that go across Canada and is there another airline that does the Van - Toronto route.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She responded with, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry but it is the policy of Big Airline Company to not tell customers about Other Smaller Airline.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thanked her and rang off. Then called OSA and got a nice flight with Media rate for the gear and a total lower fare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will note that she did not violate the company policy by telling me about the other airline, she simply told me the company policy.

Figured I’d just call you and have you do it instead, Just get me to Buick please!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was nice enough so I ended up googling the phone number and transferring him, but it still gave me a good laugh!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2urem', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'j3nitd', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'fortuneflow', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 8, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/j3nitd/get_me_to_sales/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/j3nitd/get_me_to_sales/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 208602, 'created_utc': 1601610383.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'talesfromcallcenters', 'selftext': ""I work for a car rental company as a specialist.

story but a very big accomplishment. Today after 3 years I quit! I worked for a staffing company but subcontracted through a luxury car brand and its sister company.

I work the late night shift. Most of my calls are helping reps navigate the ins and outs of various insurance contracts. One of my many duties of this job is understanding underwriting criteria and explaining it to others. An additional duty is to keep the company compliant with state and federal regulations. As a result, I don't always deliver good news to my callers. This call was no exception.\n\nCast of Characters: Me, Rep, Screaming Lady (SL)\n\nAs this is long, there's a TL; DR at the end. \n\nMe: Technical Support, this is mentalgopher. How may I help you?\n\nRep: Hey, mentalgopher, do you have an auto policy coming through for SL?\n\nMe: It's trying to. What's going on, Rep?\n\nRep: SL wants to escalate. Her policy cancelled due to underwriting reasons last week and she wants to have it reinstated. She said she didn't get any notice.\n\n(Contextual Note 1: If your insurance company is going to cancel your policy due to underwriting, they are legally required to give you what your state deems sufficient notice before the cancellation occurs. We can email the notice to you if we have your consent, but we're also legally obligated to mail it to you via USPS. This is done so you can cure the issue or obtain new insurance. If your reason for us cancelling your policy is not curable, we will not reinstate your policy with remarkably few exceptions. Some cancel reasons are serious enough where you cannot reinstate or write a new policy with us.)\n\nMe: And she's only just calling us now...?\n\nRep: Yeah.... She requested a supervisor because I told her she would have to talk about this with underwriting to get this reinstated, and they're closed.\n\nMe (reviewing notes and the cancel notice): She can talk to underwriting until the cows come home, but the notes and notice are clear about this not being something we can reinstate *or* rewrite.\n\nRep: I didn't see any notes on here.\n\n(Contextual Note 2: This was the rep's second day on the phones, so I cut her slack. There were notes. *Lots of them*, all of which were **juicy**. She was a frequent flier on our line for escalations. I had even documented an escalation from her three months ago when her policy was about two months old. At that time, the only remarkable thing about her was that she had six escalations prior to mine. Now there were about quadruple that number. But the cherry on top was the *reason* for her policy cancellation: She called in a claim, stopped filing the claim midway through intake, called customer service to cut her deductible to a quarter of what it was, then filed the claim again with a later date of loss. On top of that, her kid was operating the vehicle at the time. Claims found out that she had lied on the phone to the agent about this kid driving vehicles and living in the household. I can only tell her the reason for the cancel; I cannot go into the additional details, though I am able to see them.)\n\nMe: Not only do the notes make it clear, but so does the notice we mailed her five weeks ago regarding this issue. I have no problem saying no to her on this, either. Send her on through.\n\n(Transfer comes through moments later.)\n\nMe: Hi, my name is mentalgopher. Am I speaking with SL?\n\nSL: ARE YOU A SUPERVISOR?!?!?!\n\nMe: I am. I understand you're requesting to have your policy reinstated because you feel you didn't receive sufficient notice?\n\nSL: CAN YOU DO IT OR NOT? IF YOU CAN'T, GET ME THROUGH TO SOMEONE WHO CAN!!!!\n\nMe: I want to review a few things with you before we go over this. Please verify your email address and mailing address for me.\n\n(SL bellows her email address and mailing address into the phone.)\n\nMe: Thank you for verifying. We sent out two emails to the email provided on XX/XX and XX/XY dates. A certified letter that went over the cancellation reason was sent out on XX/XX, as well. The notice we provided for this cancellation was more than sufficient per your state's regulations. We will not be reinstating your policy at this time. No one at this company will be reinstating this policy. \n\nSL: WHY THE F\\*\\*\\* NOT, YOU STUPID C\\*\\*T?!?!?! \n\nMe: Per your policy contract, we can cancel you at any time if it's determined that you knowingly misrepresented a material fact or circumstance in connection with the presentation of a claim. That same part of your contract also mentions that we can cancel you at any time if it's determined that you knowingly misrepresented a material fact or circumstance at the time of applying for or obtaining a renewal for this policy. Directing obscenities at me will not change what appears in your contract or reinstate your policy, so please refrain from using them on this call.\n\nSL: YOU AREN'T HELPING ME, THOUGH, YOU B\\*\\*\\*H! I CAN SAY ANYTHING I WANT TO YOU! YOU'RE GOING TO GET ME FIRED FROM MY JOB BECAUSE NOW I DON'T HAVE A F\\*\\*\\*ING POLICY! I DELIVER THE NEWSPAPERS WITH THAT CAR, SO I'LL TELL THEM HOW HORRIBLE YOU ARE!\n\nMe: I'll take this time to ask you again to abstain from using profanity on this recorded call. I will also just verify with you that you're stating on a recorded line that this vehicle is being used for newspaper delivery, but you had it insured on a personal auto policy?\n\nSL: ISN'T THAT WHAT I JUST SAID, YOU STUPID C\\*\\*T-FACED W\\*\\*\\*E?!?!\n\nMe: Based on what you've just admitted on a recorded line to me, even if your cancellation had been for something other than misrepresentation on an application ***and*** in presenting a claim, your policy was still unacceptable due to the nature of your business use. Normally, I'd refer you to the commercial auto department, but the cancellation due to misrepresentation means we will not write you a new policy in any department. \n\nSL: WELL, WHAT USE ARE YOU, YA STUPID F\\*\\*\\*FACE?! YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A WHOLE FAMILY HOMELESS!!!!! DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD, YOU HORRIBLE COW?!?!?!\n\nMe: There are other insurance companies, ma'am. There's also your state's insurance pool in the event that at least two insurers in (state redacted) decline to offer you a policy. You should explore those options. Anything else I can go over with you this evening?\n\nSL: NO, YOU F\\*\\*\\*ING USELESS HEIFER! -Click-\n\nTL; DR: Caller is upset that we cancelled her policy for lying to us about two separate yet vital things.

This tale, amongst others that follow in this subreddit are from my job before this, where I worked in a callcentre for a national broadband, phone &amp; tv provider. I was in the business faults for broadband/phone line dealing with customers which I dealt with either on the phone or live chat over the 10 and a half years I was there before I was let go (that is a story for another time) - this story is from at some point whilst working there. It\'s worth keeping in mind that any names of customers, me and the company I did work for have been changed obviously to protect identities.\n\nI did post previously, under the story:\n\n[A decade worth of e-mails all gone, by the simple non clicking of a box. Life is fun, innit?](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/io57yo/a_decade_worth_of_emails_all_gone_by_the_the/)\n\n**Cast for this story:**\n\n**Scotch:** Take a wild guess, hot stuff ;)\n\n**HP:** Helicopter Pilot\n\n**CM:** Cool Manager (went through a couple whilst there, but at this point in time, CM was awesome)\n\n**CW:** Co-Worker\n\n**The Story:**\n\nFor this story I was on the front line desk for *\\*shitty ISP\\** after being on their second line desk for a bit and them wanting me to go back to help share my knowledge with the front line team. enjoy. This call happened on a Monday.\n\n*\\*beep\\**\n\n**Scotch:** Welcome to &lt;telco\'s business support line&gt; my name is Scotch, who am I speaking to today and how can I help?\n\n**HP:** Hi, my name is HP our broadband service is down, so can\'t provide the essential services we need to the local community - can you help us get our services back online?\n\n**Scotch:** Sure, let me get some account details from you and lets see if we can get the problem fixed for you today EC.\n\n*\\*does account verification\\**\n\nI can see from their account they provide emergency services for the highlands - search and rescue style thing for those lost hiking on the mountains.\n\n**Scotch:** Ok HP, I have done all the checks that need to and can see the account is all as it should. I have checked our outages system with nothing showing down in your area code.\n\n*For those who are reading this outside the UK, a typical broadband phone number via copper phone line is 01234 567898 style, as is any standard phone line number, our notice board had nothing for the customer\'s 01234 code, so in that instance, normal process was to go through basic checks and see if what was happening.*\n\n**Scotch:** What I can do with yourself is go through some checks too see if we can get this back online, before we do I just need to ask, do you or the owner/caretaker of the building not provide you with a secondary line for Broadband/Phone services in case of this scenario?\n\n**HP:** We don\'t have a backup line I am afraid, to be honest we never really thought of it - as we never thought this type of thing would happen! *\\*I died a little inside when I heard that statement - as I had heard it far too often, people not having backup\\** But I will mention that to my boss next time we speak! Though I must warn you, I am just the pilot who fly\'s the helicopter\'s for the search and rescue and don\'t know much about this IT &amp; computer stuff but will do my best.\n\n**Scotch:** Not a problem, can I just confirm the number that you are calling from, incase we get disconnected from?\n\n**HP:** Yes, it\'s &lt;not number connected to account&gt; - but only use this for today and this call, as broadband telephone number oddly still works for incoming calls *(this will be classed as* ***line 1*** *later)*, the other number *(this will be classed as* ***line 2*** *later)* we have on site is our emergency number, which you don\'t want to call. (Important for later)\n\n**Scotch:** Sure, no worries. Whilst we have been speaking I ran a few checks on the line using our diagnostics systems and can see that apart from some upstream noise on the line which could potentially indicate something on site causing the issue, all appears to be fine. I can see the total downtime of the connection has been for 5 hours. In basic terms, we need to rule out anything your end to get you back online ok? I will keep it simple as possible.\n\n**Scotch:** Do you know what modem/router you have to connect with? It\'s a typically a silver box with black sides and 4 lights on it? *(This was the typical ISP one we provided at shitty ISP for customers, only difference was it allowed the use of statics compared to the consumer model)* \n\n**HP:** We have loads of box\'s here at the command unit with blinking lights on them, so it\'s going to be a hard one to figure out chief!\n\n**Scotch:** Ok, sure thing - I get that! If you check for me you said the phone line has a phone in it which still has calls on it? Is there a wire coming out from there somewhere that goes to a wall socket of some kind for you to make calls? Your modem maybe connected to that?\n\n**HP:** Sure, give me a moment to check...\n\n*After a few moments of some huffs and grunts and some noise coming from his end, he comes back to me to update on progress. By this point around 15 minutes had went into the call as it took him a bit to verify account.*\n\n**HP:** Ok, I had a look and was able to see that the cable goes from the phone to the wall socket, but that\'s it - I don\'t see any box\'s or blinking lights tied to it.\n\n**Scotch:** Ok, it sounds like an extension socket, not the main master socket where the modem maybe connected, are you able to check to see if you have any other phone sockets?\n\n**HP:** Sorry to be a pain here, but I have an &lt;important meeting to deal with in regards to our company setup here&gt;, but I am glad to know that\'s not a major issue on the line or to do with your network. Look can you get one of your colleagues to call back on **line 1** (aka - their BB line that received incoming calls, which he advised was NOT the emergency line)  for Thursday? \n\n**Scotch:** Sure, with this being Monday, we will have slots for them, do you have a preferred time? Also with your IT guy be there or someone who know\'s your setup there? Also just to confirm **Line 1** is xxxxx xxxxxx and that\'s the number for the call back? Not **Line 2** on yyyyy yyyyyy?\n\n**HP:** Yeah, the IT guy will be in then, hence asking for Thursday - as I am on holiday as of tomorrow. His name is &lt;random name&gt;, if you call around 11:00 am he should be there and yes, that is the correct number!\n\n**Scotch:** OK, that\'s it done and thanks for your help today!\n\n*\\*click - call ends and I update notes, put it in the queue for callback Thursday\\**\n\nCue Friday when I roll in and manager and one of the callback agents was by my desk waiting on me coming in, asking me to come into meeting room.\n\n**CM:** Ok Scotch, the reason me and **CW** are here are to discuss a call you had on Monday, the company name was XYZ and you spoke to **HP** regarding his fault for the broadband fault, booking a callback for Thursday, is this correct?\n\n*\\*after around thirty seconds or so I start to remember it\\**\n\n**Scotch:** Yes, I do remember it - why are we here? Do I need the union here for representation? Am I being investigated for something?\n\n**CW:** Don\'t worry Scotch, it\'s nothing like that, I called them back as per instructions in the case notes on **line 1** as you stated in the notes, when I called them I heard the guy on the end of the phone saying to me (paraphrasing):\n\n\\--------\n\n**Guy End On Phone:** This is the mountain rescue team here, that\'s the helicopter now being dispatched, can you reconfirm the the GPS co-ords again of the person needing rescued?\n\n**CW:** Hi this is **CW** calling regarding your broadband issue that you reported on Monday?\n\n**Guy End On Phone:** Eh, what? What broadband issue? Who are you? Why are you calling us about broadband? This is an emergency service and emergency line, doing prank calls on this number is wrong!!!! Why are you calling us?\n\n**CW:** I can assure you sir, this is not a prank call? I am calling regarding a broadband fault that **HP** called about on Monday to us asking us to call you back on **Line 1** to talk to &lt;IT Guy\'s name&gt; regarding the fault?\n\n**Guy On End Of Phone:** Our broadband is working, why are you even calling us? GET ME YOUR MANAGER NOW!!!!\n\n\\--------\n\n**CM:** The manager that took that call was me, after speaking to him and a few threats, I listened to your call, to hear your side of it. Everything you did was correct, you followed the process and done things right, even confirmed the contact number from the customer. It actually transpires that broadband was actually on **Line 2** and not the first one, the customer was actually looking at the wrong phone and socket and had got the two numbers mixed up. \n\n**Scotch:** Ahh, so I done nothing wrong?\n\n**CM:** No, you did not, after him calming down, he asked me to call him back in 10 minutes, which I agreed to. After phoning him back, he spoke to the IT guy who said that he had taken the broadband down for 6 hours to re-do some of their IT setup, change some components around and install some new equipment. which he had communicated out, but **HP** did not know that. He had came in wanting to use the broadband for some stuff, noticed it was down and then called you, whilst the IT guy was taking a break and did not see him. As he left the IT guy came back and finished off the job.\n\n**Scotch:** So, what was the outcome then? Why have I been brought here into a meeting without union? *(When ever I go into any meeting I ALWAY""S request union to keep the meeting correct)* \n\n**CM:** As for **HP** \\- the manager I spoke to on site, after I explained to him that after listening to the call he gave **line 1** and not **line 2** as the right number has been trained on what is right and also to speak to IT first as the initial callback to the wrong number could have cost us *\\*shitty ISP\\** around £20,000 for the misuse of their service and other costs.  No further action required, from our end - this meeting was just to let you know what happened on the callback just incase it came back, ok?\n\n**CW:** Yeah, everything that could have been covered was - so you have nothing to worry about, the HP guy was just a bit out of the loop!\n\nAfter exchanging a few pleasantry\'s we then went back to our desks and continued on with our days, I still remember to it this day.\n\n**TLDR:** **As I sit there, at my desk with my flask of whisky and eating my haggis, I wonder what my next call would be? But then my moose beckons me out the window, indicating another rescue for us to attend!

This tale, amongst others that follow in this subreddit are from my job before this, where I worked in a callcentre for a national broadband, phone &amp;amp; tv provider. I was in the business faults for broadband/phone line dealing with customers which I dealt with either on the phone or live chat over the 10 and a half years I was there before I was let go (that is a story for another time) - this story is from at some point whilst working there. It&amp;#39;s worth keeping in mind that any names of customers, me and the company I did work for have been changed obviously to protect identities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did post previously, under the story:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/io57yo/a_decade_worth_of_emails_all_gone_by_the_the/""&gt;A decade worth of e-mails all gone, by the simple non clicking of a box.

This call happened on a Monday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\\&lt;/em&gt;beep**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotch:&lt;/strong&gt; Welcome to &amp;lt;telco&amp;#39;s business support line&amp;gt; my name is Scotch, who am I speaking to today and how can I help?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP:&lt;/strong&gt; Hi, my name is HP our broadband service is down, so can&amp;#39;t provide the essential services we need to the local community - can you help us get our services back online?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotch:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, let me get some account details from you and lets see if we can get the problem fixed for you today EC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\\&lt;/em&gt;does account verification**&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see from their account they provide emergency services for the highlands - search and rescue style thing for those lost hiking on the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotch:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok HP, I have done all the checks that need to and can see the account is all as it should. I have checked our outages system with nothing showing down in your area code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For those who are reading this outside the UK, a typical broadband phone number via copper phone line is 01234 567898 style, as is any standard phone line number, our notice board had nothing for the customer&amp;#39;s 01234 code, so in that instance, normal process was to go through basic checks and see if what was happening.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotch:&lt;/strong&gt; What I can do with yourself is go through some checks too see if we can get this back online, before we do I just need to ask, do you or the owner/caretaker of the building not provide you with a secondary line for Broadband/Phone services in case of this scenario?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP:&lt;/strong&gt; We don&amp;#39;t have a backup line I am afraid, to be honest we never really thought of it - as we never thought this type of thing would happen! &lt;em&gt;\\&lt;/em&gt;I died a little inside when I heard that statement - as I had heard it far too often, people not having backup** But I will mention that to my boss next time we speak! Though I must warn you, I am just the pilot who fly&amp;#39;s the helicopter&amp;#39;s for the search and rescue and don&amp;#39;t know much about this IT &amp;amp; computer stuff but will do my best.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotch:&lt;/strong&gt; Not a problem, can I just confirm the number that you are calling from, incase we get disconnected from?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, it&amp;#39;s &amp;lt;not number connected to account&amp;gt; - but only use this for today and this call, as broadband telephone number oddly still works for incoming calls &lt;em&gt;(this will be classed as&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;line 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;later)&lt;/em&gt;, the other number &lt;em&gt;(this will be classed as&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;line 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;later)&lt;/em&gt; we have on site is our emergency number, which you don&amp;#39;t want to call. (Important for later)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotch:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, no worries. Whilst we have been speaking I ran a few checks on the line using our diagnostics systems and can see that apart from some upstream noise on the line which could potentially indicate something on site causing the issue, all appears to be fine. I can see the total downtime of the connection has been for 5 hours. In basic terms, we need to rule out anything your end to get you back online ok? I will keep it simple as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotch:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you know what modem/router you have to connect with? It&amp;#39;s a typically a silver box with black sides and 4 lights on it? &lt;em&gt;(This was the typical ISP one we provided at shitty ISP for customers, only difference was it allowed the use of statics compared to the consumer model)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP:&lt;/strong&gt; We have loads of box&amp;#39;s here at the command unit with blinking lights on them, so it&amp;#39;s going to be a hard one to figure out chief!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotch:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok, sure thing - I get that! If you check for me you said the phone line has a phone in it which still has calls on it? Is there a wire coming out from there somewhere that goes to a wall socket of some kind for you to make calls? Your modem maybe connected to that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, give me a moment to check...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After a few moments of some huffs and grunts and some noise coming from his end, he comes back to me to update on progress. By this point around 15 minutes had went into the call as it took him a bit to verify account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok, I had a look and was able to see that the cable goes from the phone to the wall socket, but that&amp;#39;s it - I don&amp;#39;t see any box&amp;#39;s or blinking lights tied to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotch:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok, it sounds like an extension socket, not the main master socket where the modem maybe connected, are you able to check to see if you have any other phone sockets?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP:&lt;/strong&gt; Sorry to be a pain here, but I have an &amp;lt;important meeting to deal with in regards to our company setup here&amp;gt;, but I am glad to know that&amp;#39;s not a major issue on the line or to do with your network. Look can you get one of your colleagues to call back on &lt;strong&gt;line 1&lt;/strong&gt; (aka - their BB line that received incoming calls, which he advised was NOT the emergency line)  for Thursday? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scotch:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure, with this being Monday, we will have slots for them, do you have a preferred time? Also with your IT guy be there or someone who know&amp;#39;s your setup there? Also just to confirm &lt;strong&gt;Line 1&lt;/strong&gt; is xxxxx xxxxxx and that&amp;#39;s the number for the call back? Not &lt;strong&gt;Line 2&lt;/strong&gt; on yyyyy yyyyyy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, the IT guy will be in then, hence asking for Thursday - as I am on holiday as of tomorrow.

NB= Nutball caller. Me= me. \n\nMe: Welcome to [Bank Call Center], my name is renderingme, how may I help you today? \n\nNB: I just want you to know that you are the 42nd person I\'ve talked to today and I don\'t think you can help me because your bank\'s service is terrible. \n\nMe: I\'m sorry to hear that, what issue are you experiencing? \n\n(We\'re supposed to determine how we can help the customer before we even ask for their information and some people want to be difficult.)\n\nNB: Well, to start with, what is your name and badge number? And spell them PHONETICALLY. \n\nMe: *gives out info*\n\nNB: Where are you located? What city and state?\n\nMe: I can only provide the state, but I am located in [State].\n\nNB: Ok, I am going to add you to the list of 42 people I\'ve talked to today and I\'m reporting you all to the FBI. I have a long professional career and I know some people, so be prepared for the inquiry. \n\n\nAt this point I literally had to stifle a laugh. I didn\'t even know this woman\'s name or what her issue is at this point but, according to her, the FBI are going to look into me mistreating her over some personal banking issue. Yeah, ok, crazy lady. \n\nNB: Now, this is how this is going to go. I don\'t think customer service can help me, so you are going to get a supervisor on the phone or corporate or whoever I need to talk to to get a check issued from my account before it closes. Get whoever I need to talk to because I know you are useless. \n\nMe: I\'d be happy to help resolve this. My I have your card or account number?\n\nNB: NO, YOU DON\'T NEED THAT. I AM NOT TALKING TO YOU. GET ME WHOEVER I NEED TO SPEAK WITH, A SUPERVISOR OR CORPORATE OR THE PRESIDENT. I have a long career, I am very highly educated, and I know how this works. \n\nMe: I will get a supervisor for you but so they can assist further may I have your card or account number? I can pass that along to the supervisor so they can better assist. \n\nNB: NO, STOP TRYING TO GET MY INFORMATION. YOU DON\'T NEED THAT. I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS. THE ONLY THING THAT SHOULD BE COMING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS ""YES, MA\'AM."" I AM THE CUSTOMER. \n\nMe: I apologize but for the supervisor to be able to assist further, it would be easier if they had your information. May I have your name?\n\nNB: GET ME YOUR SUPERVISOR. I TALK DIRECTLY TO THE HORSE\'S MOUTH. I DON\'T TALK TO PEONS. \n\nMe: One moment, please, I will reach out for a supervisor now. \n\nI got a supervisor for her and while I was finishing up my notes, I listened in to their conversation.

NB= Nutball caller. Me= me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Welcome to [Bank Call Center], my name is renderingme, how may I help you today? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NB: I just want you to know that you are the 42nd person I&amp;#39;ve talked to today and I don&amp;#39;t think you can help me because your bank&amp;#39;s service is terrible. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;m sorry to hear that, what issue are you experiencing? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(We&amp;#39;re supposed to determine how we can help the customer before we even ask for their information and some people want to be difficult.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NB: Well, to start with, what is your name and badge number? And spell them PHONETICALLY. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: &lt;em&gt;gives out info&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NB: Where are you located? What city and state?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I can only provide the state, but I am located in [State].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NB: Ok, I am going to add you to the list of 42 people I&amp;#39;ve talked to today and I&amp;#39;m reporting you all to the FBI. I have a long professional career and I know some people, so be prepared for the inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point I literally had to stifle a laugh. I didn&amp;#39;t even know this woman&amp;#39;s name or what her issue is at this point but, according to her, the FBI are going to look into me mistreating her over some personal banking issue. Yeah, ok, crazy lady. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NB: Now, this is how this is going to go. I don&amp;#39;t think customer service can help me, so you are going to get a supervisor on the phone or corporate or whoever I need to talk to to get a check issued from my account before it closes. Get whoever I need to talk to because I know you are useless. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;d be happy to help resolve this. My I have your card or account number?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NB: NO, YOU DON&amp;#39;T NEED THAT. I AM NOT TALKING TO YOU. GET ME WHOEVER I NEED TO SPEAK WITH, A SUPERVISOR OR CORPORATE OR THE PRESIDENT. I have a long career, I am very highly educated, and I know how this works. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I will get a supervisor for you but so they can assist further may I have your card or account number? I can pass that along to the supervisor so they can better assist. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NB: NO, STOP TRYING TO GET MY INFORMATION. YOU DON&amp;#39;T NEED THAT. I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS. THE ONLY THING THAT SHOULD BE COMING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH IS &amp;quot;YES, MA&amp;#39;AM.&amp;quot; I AM THE CUSTOMER. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I apologize but for the supervisor to be able to assist further, it would be easier if they had your information. May I have your name?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NB: GET ME YOUR SUPERVISOR. I TALK DIRECTLY TO THE HORSE&amp;#39;S MOUTH. I DON&amp;#39;T TALK TO PEONS. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: One moment, please, I will reach out for a supervisor now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got a supervisor for her and while I was finishing up my notes, I listened in to their conversation.

In most of our forms we will need customers to key in their credit card (CC) details. Mostly it\'s just to avoid fraud cases and the like, because there have been alot even with CC inserted still. \n\n\nSo this lady has her CC inserted to this ""pay to the hotel"" booking. One thing I should note is that for these types of reservations, we are not the ones charging them. We collect their details, yes, but in our system we have no way to charge the card directly. We see the last 4 digits of the card, but thats it. Nothing we can do aside from cancel. The hotels are the one who have the ability to perform the charges because its ""pay to the hotel."" If the hotel approves a refund for these types, the refund comes directly from the hotel\'s account, not us. And the hotel will charge at any given point for confirmation, most likely before it goes within the cancellation policy.\n\n\nAnd so we always get confused customers when the hotel tries to charge the hotel before the check-in date because they assume its paying upon check-in rather than pay TO the hotel. I\'ve never personally used this types of reservations, so I don\'t know what it looks like on customer\'s front end. But if we have so much of confusion for the same thing, obviously we have to do something about it &amp; I won\'t deny that for even one second.\n\n\nSo this lady had her CC stolen, and we weren\'t informed about it at all and had no clue up until this point. She probably didn\'t think it was our problem because she assumed her reservation can be paid AT the hotel. So she called in asking why her booking was cancelled, I found out that our supplier cancelled it yesterday because her CC was declined when the hotel tried to charge her before check-in and she didn\'t respond to our emails from 2 days ago asking her to provide a new one within a day or so, to avoid her reservation from being cancelled. So it was cancelled automatically because we sent her a notice &amp; she didn\'t respond at all.\n\nCustomer: why did you guys cancel without my permission?\n\nMe: We have actually sent an email 2 days ago informing you that your card has been declined and it will be cancelled if we didn\'t receive your new details.\n\nCustomer: Yes I saw that email, but I didn\'t have reception so I wasn\'t able to open or reply to it until yesterday when I had actually received it.\n\nMe: i\'m sorry ma\'am since this reservation has been cancelled and no payment has been collected, we can\'t uncancel this booking or search for an alternative accommodation for you as you have not been charged for this.\n\nCustomer: I don\'t care, that is not my problem. I didn\'t have reception, how was I able to access it?\n\nMe: I understand, but your reservation has been cancelled and we can\'t assist you since there is no charge to this reservation.\n\nCustomer: No you don\'t understand. I want to talk to your supervisor\n\nMe: Unfortunately I can\'t do that as we\'re not allowed to transfer our calls to our supervisors. Even if I did, they would advise you the exact same thing I just said.\n\nCustomer: i don\'t care, I don\'t want to speak to you anymore.\n\nSo I consulted with one of my supervisors. Guess what? He said exactly the same thing I did. I told him that I\'ve already pushed her request back multiple times (Idk why we\'re not allowed to transfer to our supervisors, but I assume its to avoid frequent requests like that?) He agreed that he would take over the case if she kept insisting. He told me to mention the whole ""we sent an email, no response from u, it was cancelled, no payment was received, we can\'t do anything about it now"" I tried:\n\nCustomer: I don\'t care what you have to say. Transfer me to your supervisor even if he says the same thing as you just did. I want to speak to a supervisor\n\nSo I transferred, checked back on the case 2 hours later. Lo and behold my supervisor also couldn\'t offer any solutions to her since no payment was received. It would have been different if she was actually charged or if she was really not notified at all, we would have offered relocation or some type of compensation for her. We aren\'t heartless. He even mentions in his notes that he said the same thing I did, and suddenly shes ok with it ???? I don\'t get that. You couldn\'t accept our procedure when it came from a normal agent, but the moment you spoke to the supervisor, you\'re all for it...? You just wasted everyones time.\n\nI understand that if she genuinely had no reception and suddenly found out her booking was cancelled, I would probably be pissed too. But I\'d be way more pissed if it got cancelled and I was still charged, which didn\'t happen here. I\'m just annoyed she HAD to speak to a supervisor to get off our backs.

I got ranted at for 10 minutes, I just let her talk because my head hurt and I knew she wasn’t going to stop. She said she had submitted the paperwork (they always say this), and was concerned with where it was now. I kindly explained that I’m not that office so I wouldn’t be able to find that out for her, but she could call that office directly to ask. She then said I was being combative because I told her I’m with a third party company, she then decided I was going to help her reapply. That meant I was going to have her with me at least another 20 minutes.

I asked her primary race and she gave it to me, but then asked if she had to provide it. I let her know I didn’t have to select one and I could just use a default. She then went completely off on me because I didn’t give her that option before, I explained to her that I’m not allowed to do that because I have to ask them a certain way. She then said I didn’t offer her the default because I was racist, I offered the default 4 times while she was ranting at me. She said she could tell by my voice that I was white and that I was a racist because I couldn’t find her paperwork and I asked her race.

She made me feel incredibly small and worthless, it wasn’t being called a racist that bothered me because I know I’m not. It was the digs at how awful I was at everything. She honestly seemed to enjoy berating me, and I think she did want to take her issues out on someone.

The day was fairly slow so I was not in a hurry and it\'s always fun to do some detective work.\n\nA call came in and the system threw an account and a case at me right away. As I gave my greetings I read all the information I had in front of me and asked for the full story just in case I was missing some info.\n\nThe guy on the phone told me he had two reservations for Hotel X. According to him reservation #1 was for monday with a normal rate and reservation #2 was for monday and tuesday with a discounted rate, but he told me the rates were flipped by the hotel and he somehow got charged twice for the one day reservation. He also mentions the case I have in front of me and tells me he was looking for an update.\n\nNow, the case was opened like 2 weeks ago and closed like 5 days after. No one ever contacted him and no refund had been issued at all. First clue something was off.\n\nSecond clue something was off was that he actually had 3 rooms at the hotel and one was cancelled. Did he mention the third room? Not at all.\n\nSo I ask about said third room and he tries to dismiss it. ""Oh I had another room for the 2 days and I cancelled it, but it turned out my kids did want to go to the hotel after all so I booked it again later. I cancelled that room several days before arrival, don\'t worry about that one."" and at this point I knew he was saying nothing but lies.\n\nRoom #3 was not only booked the same day as #2 but at the exact same time. I did not even have to look at the reservation history because the reservation numbers were consecutive and that only happens when you book more than one room at once.\n\nSo I started digging.\n\nLess than 5 minutes later I had in front of me the full history of all 3 rooms, all the account information I needed and even the receipts for these reservations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is what I found:\n\nRoom #1 was booked under the discounted rate from the start. Room history showed no changes to the reservation at all. Not made by us, not made by the hotel, not made by the person I was talking to.\n\nRoom #2 was booked under the normal rate from the start. Again, room history showed no changes at all.\n\nHe apparently booked the wrong rates for these reservations and realized way too late, he knew he could not fix it so he decided to pretend the hotel screwed things up so he could save a couple of bucks.\n\nOh and the extra charge? Room #3 was not only booked at the same time as #2 but after looking at its history I could see it was cancelled the same day of check-in... at like 11p.m. (That is, in case you are wondering, almost 24 hours after the cancellation policy expires.) This extra charge, and the receipt corroborated this, was a late cancellation fee of one night plus taxes. Not a mistake.\n\nSo here I am thinking something along the lines of ""Holy crap"" as I go back to the dude, who I put on hold to look all that up, and told him as nicely as I could that I knew he was making all of this up and that he would get no refunds. \n\nNow, he could have let this go and I would have done nothing. I would\'ve just ended the call and moved on to the next person on the line because I don\'t get paid enough to care after a call ends, but he decided to be an asshole.\n\nHe called me stupid and a liar, he insisted all he told me was the truth and he demanded a refund. I again told him I would not be giving him anything (All the money he wanted was way over what I\'m allowed to give anyway.), he yelled some more and said the magic words:\n\n""I want to speak to a supervisor."" He demanded\n\n""Sure thing"" I said\n\nI could\'ve said no. I could\'ve said something like ""They have the same information I do, sir. They will tell you the same thing I just did."" and just ended the call but, you see, whenever I transfer anyone to a supervisor I am required to make a note on the caller\'s account. Both for whoever supervisor that gets my call to have something in writing about the issue they\'re about to be involved in (Besides me verbally explaining everything too of course) and for anyone else that receives a call from this particular person to know how to deal with them.\n\nThese notes, I might add, are permanent.\n\nSo this dude will not only be shut down by a supervisor, he will also have documented in his account that he tried to lie to us more than once and get a substantial amount of money out of it. And he was a top tier member of this hotel company\'s loyalty program, so he might actually have some pretty serious consequences coming his way.\n\nIf something fun comes out of this whole situation I will update you all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Dude lies about things that are easily proven.

Both for whoever supervisor that gets my call to have something in writing about the issue they&amp;#39;re about to be involved in (Besides me verbally explaining everything too of course) and for anyone else that receives a call from this particular person to know how to deal with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These notes, I might add, are permanent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So this dude will not only be shut down by a supervisor, he will also have documented in his account that he tried to lie to us more than once and get a substantial amount of money out of it. And he was a top tier member of this hotel company&amp;#39;s loyalty program, so he might actually have some pretty serious consequences coming his way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If something fun comes out of this whole situation I will update you all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Dude lies about things that are easily proven. Ends up with a permanent mark on his record and with no refunds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None,

We all truly are trying our absolute best but eight members of the team are currently off work with stress. \n\nTo make matters worse my boyfriend (with whom I live) just discovered two of his jiu jitsu team mates have tested positive for covid. I informed my manager straight away that I wanted to get tested to which he replied that I had no reason to Not be in the office as ‘third person contact isn’t a problem’, he also offered me oh so generously one of my vacation days so I could go get tested. I didn’t want to risk getting anyone Sick and so have booked a vacation day off tomorrow to go to the clinic.\n\nWhen he discovered this he decided to remind me of how busy we are at the moment and that I should be more considerate of the workload my colleagues have to deal with - “don’t you think you should only get tested if it’s urgent? You know how much work there is to do and cases to close.

We all truly are trying our absolute best but eight members of the team are currently off work with stress. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse my boyfriend (with whom I live) just discovered two of his jiu jitsu team mates have tested positive for covid. I informed my manager straight away that I wanted to get tested to which he replied that I had no reason to Not be in the office as ‘third person contact isn’t a problem’, he also offered me oh so generously one of my vacation days so I could go get tested. I didn’t want to risk getting anyone Sick and so have booked a vacation day off tomorrow to go to the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When he discovered this he decided to remind me of how busy we are at the moment and that I should be more considerate of the workload my colleagues have to deal with - “don’t you think you should only get tested if it’s urgent? You know how much work there is to do and cases to close. I really don’t get why you’re doing this... it’s just completely unnecessary, your colleagues are going to be here working hard whilst you’re taking time off”. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now I feel like the asshole!!

They sent me all the stuff to work from home and I was there the next month. \n\nNow I am an introvert by nature, but I had worked in a call center before as a political surveyor. I know it can be tiring and people irritable, but I always had a can-do attitude and I even managed to be the lead surveyor at that job. So I thought: this should be a piece of cake, right?\n\nWell that\'s when I learned that I would be being taught in an entire class of people, with another class following behind me. In hindsight, this was a red flag, but I figured they must be expanding their business and need as many as they can get. \n\nSo we spend the first three months learning the ends and out of insurance and after all that we finally take our tests and get licensed. Sadly half the class did not pass the test (50 percent attrition is also a red flag).\n\nNow throughout the time that they are ""Teaching"" us, we are supposed to familiarize ourselves with their system for writing insurance quotes. Seems pretty intuitive, at first - just type in info and it spits out a quote, right? Most of it is just finesse. \n\nWrong. Wrong. Wrong.\n\nI didn\'t realize what an ungodly beast this thing was until I got on the phone and kept getting calls asking things I didn\'t know about and constantly having to call my manager in for help.  It was stressful, difficult, and unproductive and I started to fear hearing the ping of an incoming call because I felt wholly inadequate. \n\nManagement of course seemed to have had an attitude of ""well, you\'ll learn, so just do your best."" For someone like me, that was unbearable. And it seriously made me feel worse and worse the more quotes I took and realized I was way out of my depth. When I told my manager that I felt extremely uncomfortable he replied that ""sometimes you have to be uncomfortable to grow and you have a choice between doing that or not growing and staying comfortable.""\n\nAt this point, I realized why so many people are constantly being hired: it\'s a meat grinder and I was not prepared for it all. \n\nAt last I got a call asking for a bind. A simple task - the previous agent had already done the entire quote. All that was left to do was confirm the details, get the payment info, and get it started. Easy-peasy, 1-2-3.  And I was almost there! Before the customer decided he also wanted a mobile home policy. \n\nWhat followed was a nightmare. We had not gone over mobile homes at all - only regular houses/condos/and rentals. I struggled through every step, trying my darndest to make it work. Having to call my supervisor on the other line to try to get me through this. \n\nAfter 2 hours it was no luck and my customer hung up and said he\'d call again tomorrow. \n\nI had never felt so embarrassed, exhausted, and frustrated all in one. I was stressed and it was the end of my shift.\n\nMy supervisor pulls me aside and gives me a talk about how to ""take it easy and relax"" but ices it off with this: ""So, we\'re going to call him back tomorrow, right?""  \n\n\nAt this point, defeated and beat down, I mumble a pathetic ""sure"".\n\nHe pauses and then reiterates and says ""I need a solid yes or no.""\n\nThat was the final straw. I told him what he wanted to hear and rather than suffer that indignity again, I simply resigned the next day. \n\nWas that the right move? Probably not. But sometimes the money isn\'t worth it. I know moving forward I am going to try to avoid doing any job involving phones again.

I had a man call in regards to his motorcycle policy other day and he was already pretty fired up but nothing I’m not used to at this point. For some extra context, our website allows customers to schedule future payments but 9/10 from what I get they always schedule on or after the cancellation date so it never gets pulled and they still get cancelled. Why don’t they fix this? I have no idea. But anyhoo…\n\nCaller: Why did I get a cancellation notice?\n\nMe: Well, you’re due date was 10 days ago. The last available date to make the payment is this Thursday otherwise it will cancel 12:01 AM Friday.\n\nC: My GF was supposed to handle that. Didn’t she make the payment?\n\nM: One moment, I’ll take a further look into this… Okay, so there is a payment scheduled but it’s set to come out the cancellation date. I can guarantee that the payment will not go through since the policy is set to cancel at 12:01 AM day. This will result in the policy needing to be reactivated.\n\nC: GF get in here! Why didn’t you make the payment sooner?! I don’t need to be getting cancellation notices and sh*t. Wtf did you do?\n\nGF: I set it to come out that day because I get paid that day. I had other things to pay for.\n\nC: Like what?!\n\nGF: Our car insurance, utility bills, groceries…\n\nAt this point the dude starts screaming at and berating her for spending money on groceries and such and not HIS motorcycle policy. Oh how it made my blood boil hearing this entitled jerk scream at someone who loves him enough to pay for his insurance. The worst part is I can hear the hurt in her voice as she weakly tries to explain herself to him. I have to sit there and wait for him to either come back to me or disconnect since he’s not being foul or a threat to me and a simple “Is there anything else I can help with today?” will not suffice.\n\nC: Lady is there a way you can give us until Friday to make the payment? An extension?\n\nM: Unfortunately I cannot as the cancellation notice is already an extension. \n\nC: This is bullsh*t. What company doesn’t provide an extension?! I know you can!!\n\nM: I apologize, sir. But I won’t be able to provide another extension on top of the one provided by the cancellation notice.\n\nC: Then get me to your supervisor! I bet they will give me one!!\n\nMe: Okay. *puts caller on hold and calls the sup line*\n\nSup: Hey, girl! What you got for me?\n\nM: I have man who thinks we can give him an extension when we’ve already sent out the cancellation notice which he clearly has seen.

I had a man call in regards to his motorcycle policy other day and he was already pretty fired up but nothing I’m not used to at this point. For some extra context, our website allows customers to schedule future payments but 9/10 from what I get they always schedule on or after the cancellation date so it never gets pulled and they still get cancelled. Why don’t they fix this? I have no idea. But anyhoo…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Caller: Why did I get a cancellation notice?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Well, you’re due date was 10 days ago. The last available date to make the payment is this Thursday otherwise it will cancel 12:01 AM Friday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: My GF was supposed to handle that. Didn’t she make the payment?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;M: One moment, I’ll take a further look into this… Okay, so there is a payment scheduled but it’s set to come out the cancellation date. I can guarantee that the payment will not go through since the policy is set to cancel at 12:01 AM day. This will result in the policy needing to be reactivated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: GF get in here! Why didn’t you make the payment sooner?! I don’t need to be getting cancellation notices and sh*t. Wtf did you do?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GF: I set it to come out that day because I get paid that day. I had other things to pay for.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Like what?!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;GF: Our car insurance, utility bills, groceries…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point the dude starts screaming at and berating her for spending money on groceries and such and not HIS motorcycle policy. Oh how it made my blood boil hearing this entitled jerk scream at someone who loves him enough to pay for his insurance. The worst part is I can hear the hurt in her voice as she weakly tries to explain herself to him. I have to sit there and wait for him to either come back to me or disconnect since he’s not being foul or a threat to me and a simple “Is there anything else I can help with today?” will not suffice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Lady is there a way you can give us until Friday to make the payment? An extension?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;M: Unfortunately I cannot as the cancellation notice is already an extension. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: This is bullsh*t. What company doesn’t provide an extension?! I know you can!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;M: I apologize, sir. But I won’t be able to provide another extension on top of the one provided by the cancellation notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Then get me to your supervisor! I bet they will give me one!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay. &lt;em&gt;puts caller on hold and calls the sup line&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sup: Hey, girl! What you got for me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;M: I have man who thinks we can give him an extension when we’ve already sent out the cancellation notice which he clearly has seen.

consider myself ""call center adjacent"" because in my dept, we\'re always encouraged to help our members call into our Member Service line, as opposed to just giving them the number and telling them to fuck off, I mean, call on their own. I don\'t normally mind, but on days like today, it comes in so frequently and takes so long that I can\'t get to my other work responsibilities. \n\nSee, while they have me set up to work from home, I don\'t have a way to simply forward a call to the call center, so I have to just stay on the line and listen in, because there\'s not much work I can do without my phone. Today is one of this days where I\'m getting these types of calls back to back and it\'s really stressing me out. Here\'s two quick examples of the things I\'ve had to just sit and deal with: \n\n1. Inbound call from a member I\'ve known for years, says he\'s had issues making his premium payment so I offer to call into member services, get to the payment portal and let him punch in his info. Payment doesn\'t go through so I say guess we have to contact one of the reps, and work my way through the overly complicated menu to do so. \n\nThe rep is way too but the book and practically yells at me for being on the line, asking why I can\'t just forward the call in, as if she doesn\'t know we\'re all working from home and my dept isn\'t set up like that, we use our business provided cell phones and not virtually logged into a call board. Takes about 20 mins for her to verify my identity despite the member giving her full permission to speak while I\'m on the line. \n\nFinally she tries to address his issue, and completely missed the point. Ignores the fact that he tried to make a payment and recieved an error code, wants to jump into the online enrollment issue, but all she can say is ""I don\'t see you registered, so I can\'t really help you"" with the member getting frustrated and replying ""well I told you I\'m not registered because it keeps giving me an error, so there\'s nothing for you to look up because I can never complete the registration!"" At which point I have to come back on and act as mediator. \n\nWe finally move in to the real issue, trying to see if, for whatever reason, his acct being in a ""delinquent status"" is affecting him from making payment by phone. She CAN see an attempt was made, but offered no answer other than to try again, and for some reason seemed to be confused by what a debit card is. \n\nMember: I tried to use a visa debit..\n\n\nRep (interrupts) visa debbie? Idk what that is...\n\nMember: no, a visa DEBIT card, I tried to pay the...\n\n\nRep (interrupts again) yeah I don\'t think we take debit, can you use the credit portion? \n\n\nMember: your system asked to make a payment by ""credit or debit"" and I tried to use my visa to pay...\n\n\nRep (interrupts..again): it\'s not Amex is it? Cuz we definitely don\'t take amex...\n\nMember (very frustrated): no, it\'s a visa card, it\'s also my debit card, and I tried to...\n\nRep (yup... interrupts again): yeah don\'t use the debit number, use the credit card only...\n\nMember:. Can you just transfer me back to the payment portal please? \n\nRep: would you like to take a brief...\n\nI had to end disconnect and calm this guy down and told him I\'d get us back to the payment portal... We made the payment, no issue this time, thankful, but I had lost 45 mins of my day. \n\n\nThen.... Almost immidiately after, get a call from another member who wants to change his primary doctor. I say ""sure, we can do that. I\'ll have to call in to our Member Service dept, but we can definitely get that changed for you today. Before I call, do you have the doctors info? We need the doctors full name, address, phone number and if you have it, the NPI number would be the quickest method.."" \n\nMember: ""yes the doctors name is..."" \n\nMe: oh no worries, I don\'t need it. I just need to make sure you have it because the other dept will need it, so just hold on to that info, let me get them on the phone..\n\nMember: ok so you need the address? It\'s 81..\n\nMe: no no worries, just save it for the member service reps. \n\nI connect the lines, this time there\'s no 20 mins verification process because this person must have understood my depts role and knows we do this all the time. Speaks to the member: \n\nRep: do you have the doctors name and address? \n\nMember: yeah, the name is Sonia. \n\nRep: and the last name? \n\nMember: oh the last name? Uh... I\'m not sure. It\'s Sonia though, at the clinic where I meant /u/easycure at to enroll\n\nRep: I need a little more info to look up the right doctor, do you have the phone number? \n\nMember: no I don\'t have it. \n\nRep: I need the doctors full name to try and search it, do you have any idea what the last name would be? \n\nMember: it\'s a sonia...uh.. sonia... v________ (spells out a name that sounds very wrong) \n\nRep: ok and what\'s the address? \n\nMember: oh ok, she had two, one (is) 87 south ____ and...\n\nRep: ok slow down a bit, let me confirm the first one, you said 2187 south ____? \n\nMember: no, I said one (is) 86 South ____\n\nRep: ok so that\'s 187 South ____?\n\n(This went on for some time)\n\nRep: ok I checked the doctors at that address, was the doctor Sonia ____ (much simpler name than what he tried to spell. Literally added letters that weren\'t there)\n\n\nIt went on a bit with more mishearing and misunderstandings but by this point I was just done, mentally. I laid on my couch and waited for them to wrap up so I could type up my mandatory summary of the interaction and take lunch. Another 45 mins had passed, and when I notify my supervisor that my mid day quota is a big fat zero and he questions why, I just refer him to look at my calendar and see all the dumb interactions I\'ve had today. \n\nSigh', 'author_fullname': 't2_3q7du', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Sigh.. what a day (call center adjacent short stories)', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/talesfromcallcenters', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'long', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_iyert6', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.98, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 29, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'L', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 29, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1600911174.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.talesfromcallcenters', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So...I don&amp;#39;t work in my (health insurance) company&amp;#39;s call center, but I consider myself &amp;quot;call center adjacent&amp;quot; because in my dept, we&amp;#39;re always encouraged to help our members call into our Member Service line, as opposed to just giving them the number and telling them to fuck off, I mean, call on their own.

This isn't to ridicule people with social anxiety or other similar conditions. Fwiw, I'm a manic depressive. I'm merely sharing his story here.\n\nDude has an issue with his bluetooth headphones right earpiece having a crackling sound. I did troubleshooting and it didn't work (90% of the time we already know it's a hardware issue, but QA insists we stick by the basic troubleshooting first). So then came the time to offer him service options.\n\nMe: Thanks for waiting. I appreciate your patience. Your options are to go to a store and look for a replacement right earpiece --  stocks depend on availability. Or we ship you a replacement right earpiece which you'll get within 7 business days.\n\nC: I have agoraphobia, social anxiety, and [insert another socially hindering condition that I forgot]. I can't go to the store.\n\nMe: ...Honestly, I'm a manic depressive and I have days where I absolutely just don't want to talk to people as well. I can relate. We still have shipping option.\n\nC: I can't do that because you'd have to place an authorization hold on my card so you can ship the headphones replacement to me. I don't have that much in my account.\n\nMe: That's true, there's a hold. It's returned if you ship the headphones back to us after you get the replacement. Instructions and box will come with your replacement. The web payment link expires in 10 days, so you have around 10 days to figure something out with the card.\n\nC: Can I just mail it to you, you repair it, and ship them back to me?\n\nMe: That's brilliant since you have warranty and might not have to pay anything except maybe the shipping, but well it isn't really an option. That's a process we only offer for phones and tablets.\n\nC: That is ridiculous. Under [some legal Act pertaining to people with disabilities] you should accommodate me given my condition so I'm not at a disadvantage and discriminated.\n\nMe: If I had the authority to make an exception, I would. These are policies set forth by people much higher than me. I'm not trying to make this difficult for you, again I'm on your side here, just that these are the only options we have for you.\n\nC: Talk to your supervisor have him Google [law]. Under Section [x] read the entire paragraph.\n\nMe: You're bringing legalities, so I'd like to inform you I'm not a legal representative of the company. If such a law exists you are most definitely entitled then, but since there are legalities involved you'd have to get a lawyer and have them contact our legal department.\n\nC: I just want my headphones serviced. I have a disability that prevents me interacting normally!\n\nMe: Okay, then your options remain the same.\n\nC: I know it's not your fault, so your company doesn't have policies in place for people like me?\n\nMe: I'm actually going through all relevant policies on my end for the third time as we speak to make sure I'm not missing anything out. Nothing here says anything about such a law or anything close to it... I only have instructions here how to guide you to contact our legal department since you've expressed sentiments along that.\n\nC: [proceeds to copy paste the ENTIRE law, with every single section of it] \n\nMe: I'm really not the legal representative. You have to contact our legal department. I can give you everything you'll need to get to them, just say the word.\n\nC: No, I shouldn't have to do that! You're required by law to adjust and accommodate me! I've been fighting companies for years about this!\n\nMe: And I wish it hadn't been that way. I'd like to join you in the fight, so just give me the go signal and I'll detail everything you need to contact our legal team. (Meanwhile, I contact a senior because I can't gain agreement as per policy. These take place in chat including the customer interaction, if you're wondering.)\n\n(Senior basically assures me everything I've been doing is already correct, none else can be done. I bid farewell to the senior, confident I can take it from here.)\n\nMe: I just contacted a senior and they pretty much just said the same thing I've already given you. \n\nC: Can I just mail them to one of your stores?\n\nMe: We don't have that process. You have to make an appointment and show up to the store.\n\nC: Can you get me their email so I can verify? You really shouldn't be discriminating and refusing to help me.\n\nMe: I don't see how offering you every single option still means discrimination and refusal to help. Anyway, here's all the info I have for the store. (store name, address, phone number, etc. no email) There you can see they don't really have an email address. None of our stores do. Only way to contact is via phones.\n\nC: I'M NOT CALLING THEM! I haven't had a phone for years and phone calls give me anxiety that's why I took this via chat with you!\n\nMe: You could probably borrow someone's phone and text them.\n\nC: This number is a landline and not a cell phone number! \n\nMe: Apologies. I don't live in your country so I honestly can't tell an actual telephone number from a cellphone number.\n\nC: So you're refusing me service, therefore I'm discriminated.\n\nMe: We're not refusing service. Please trust us customer service people when we provide information and give resolutions. We've put months of our life into training and we never stop training on the daily. When we give you something, it's accurate and was done under careful consideration. My point being: all your options are final. I've done my part here and have fulfilled my role. I can't do anything that's outside my authority. These are the cards we're dealt, I can guide you how to deal with them and make it work for you, but you have to let me.\n\nC: Get a supervisor and have them review the law!\n\nMe: We are not legal representatives and again, my supervisor and I have already reviewed every policy we have. You have to contact our legal department.\n\nC: (rant again of how he's discriminated)\n\nMe: If you trust someone, have them go to the store and take your headphones. Have them provide the serial number so the store can check your warranty status. Have them bring your ID for verification. You don't have to personally go to the store. That's one workaround.\n\nC: (ignores suggestion, rants again) Where can I get a copy of this chat transcript?\n\nMe: (reiterate everything and educate him, then contact senior again because at this point I'm just tired tbh.)\n\n(Another senior responds and advises me to just repeat everything. I raised him a policy we have where we low-tier agents can end chat if resolution is not accepted after three attempts. Asked the senior if I can end the chat myself or he takes over and repeats everything then ends the chat. Senior gave the go signal to end chat and provided me a positioning statement if I needed one.)\n\nMe: Can I help with anything else? \n\nC: Yeah, get me a supervisor if they can do something else.\n\nMe: I've spoken with two already and they have the same options I've given you. You may refer to my previous responses for your resolution. If there's nothing else, I have to end the chat here. I hate to do this, but I don't see us getting anywhere with this. I wish we'd met under different circumstances because you sound like a really nice guy, honestly. But, I must end the chat at this point since I've already given you my resolution.\n\nAnd that was it. It's still baffling to me how difficult life must be for the guy."", 'author_fullname': 't2_4gnweypj', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Severe case of social anxiety', 'link_flair_richtext': [], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/talesfromcallcenters', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 6, 'link_flair_css_class': 'long', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_ixl4ps', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'dark', 'upvote_ratio': 0.97, 'author_flair_background_color': None, 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 43, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'L', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 43, 'approved_by': None, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': False, 'author_flair_css_class': None, 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1600800936.0, 'link_flair_type': 'text', 'wls': 6, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.talesfromcallcenters', 'allow_live_comments': True, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin with...

Or we ship you a replacement right earpiece which you&amp;#39;ll get within 7 business days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: I have agoraphobia, social anxiety, and [insert another socially hindering condition that I forgot]. I can&amp;#39;t go to the store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: ...Honestly, I&amp;#39;m a manic depressive and I have days where I absolutely just don&amp;#39;t want to talk to people as well. I can relate. We still have shipping option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: I can&amp;#39;t do that because you&amp;#39;d have to place an authorization hold on my card so you can ship the headphones replacement to me. I don&amp;#39;t have that much in my account.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: That&amp;#39;s true, there&amp;#39;s a hold. It&amp;#39;s returned if you ship the headphones back to us after you get the replacement. Instructions and box will come with your replacement. The web payment link expires in 10 days, so you have around 10 days to figure something out with the card.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Can I just mail it to you, you repair it, and ship them back to me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: That&amp;#39;s brilliant since you have warranty and might not have to pay anything except maybe the shipping, but well it isn&amp;#39;t really an option. That&amp;#39;s a process we only offer for phones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: That is ridiculous. Under [some legal Act pertaining to people with disabilities] you should accommodate me given my condition so I&amp;#39;m not at a disadvantage and discriminated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: If I had the authority to make an exception, I would. These are policies set forth by people much higher than me. I&amp;#39;m not trying to make this difficult for you, again I&amp;#39;m on your side here, just that these are the only options we have for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Talk to your supervisor have him Google [law]. Under Section [x] read the entire paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: You&amp;#39;re bringing legalities, so I&amp;#39;d like to inform you I&amp;#39;m not a legal representative of the company. If such a law exists you are most definitely entitled then, but since there are legalities involved you&amp;#39;d have to get a lawyer and have them contact our legal department.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: I just want my headphones serviced. I have a disability that prevents me interacting normally!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Okay, then your options remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: I know it&amp;#39;s not your fault, so your company doesn&amp;#39;t have policies in place for people like me?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;m actually going through all relevant policies on my end for the third time as we speak to make sure I&amp;#39;m not missing anything out. Nothing here says anything about such a law or anything close to it... I only have instructions here how to guide you to contact our legal department since you&amp;#39;ve expressed sentiments along that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: [proceeds to copy paste the ENTIRE law, with every single section of it] &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;m really not the legal representative. You have to contact our legal department. I can give you everything you&amp;#39;ll need to get to them, just say the word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: No, I shouldn&amp;#39;t have to do that! You&amp;#39;re required by law to adjust and accommodate me! I&amp;#39;ve been fighting companies for years about this!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: And I wish it hadn&amp;#39;t been that way. I&amp;#39;d like to join you in the fight, so just give me the go signal and I&amp;#39;ll detail everything you need to contact our legal team. (Meanwhile, I contact a senior because I can&amp;#39;t gain agreement as per policy. These take place in chat including the customer interaction, if you&amp;#39;re wondering.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Senior basically assures me everything I&amp;#39;ve been doing is already correct, none else can be done. I bid farewell to the senior, confident I can take it from here.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I just contacted a senior and they pretty much just said the same thing I&amp;#39;ve already given you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Can I just mail them to one of your stores?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: We don&amp;#39;t have that process. You have to make an appointment and show up to the store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Can you get me their email so I can verify? You really shouldn&amp;#39;t be discriminating and refusing to help me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I don&amp;#39;t see how offering you every single option still means discrimination and refusal to help. Anyway, here&amp;#39;s all the info I have for the store. (store name, address, phone number, etc. no email) There you can see they don&amp;#39;t really have an email address. None of our stores do. Only way to contact is via phones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: I&amp;#39;M NOT CALLING THEM! I haven&amp;#39;t had a phone for years and phone calls give me anxiety that&amp;#39;s why I took this via chat with you!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: You could probably borrow someone&amp;#39;s phone and text them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: This number is a landline and not a cell phone number! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Apologies. I don&amp;#39;t live in your country so I honestly can&amp;#39;t tell an actual telephone number from a cellphone number.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: So you&amp;#39;re refusing me service, therefore I&amp;#39;m discriminated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: We&amp;#39;re not refusing service. Please trust us customer service people when we provide information and give resolutions. We&amp;#39;ve put months of our life into training and we never stop training on the daily. When we give you something, it&amp;#39;s accurate and was done under careful consideration. My point being: all your options are final. I&amp;#39;ve done my part here and have fulfilled my role. I can&amp;#39;t do anything that&amp;#39;s outside my authority. These are the cards we&amp;#39;re dealt, I can guide you how to deal with them and make it work for you, but you have to let me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Get a supervisor and have them review the law!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: We are not legal representatives and again, my supervisor and I have already reviewed every policy we have. You have to contact our legal department.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: (rant again of how he&amp;#39;s discriminated)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: If you trust someone, have them go to the store and take your headphones. Have them provide the serial number so the store can check your warranty status. Have them bring your ID for verification. You don&amp;#39;t have to personally go to the store. That&amp;#39;s one workaround.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: (ignores suggestion, rants again) Where can I get a copy of this chat transcript?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: (reiterate everything and educate him, then contact senior again because at this point I&amp;#39;m just tired tbh.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Another senior responds and advises me to just repeat everything. I raised him a policy we have where we low-tier agents can end chat if resolution is not accepted after three attempts. Asked the senior if I can end the chat myself or he takes over and repeats everything then ends the chat. Senior gave the go signal to end chat and provided me a positioning statement if I needed one.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: Can I help with anything else? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;C: Yeah, get me a supervisor if they can do something else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: I&amp;#39;ve spoken with two already and they have the same options I&amp;#39;ve given you. You may refer to my previous responses for your resolution. If there&amp;#39;s nothing else, I have to end the chat here. I hate to do this, but I don&amp;#39;t see us getting anywhere with this. I wish we&amp;#39;d met under different circumstances because you sound like a really nice guy, honestly. But, I must end the chat at this point since I&amp;#39;ve already given you my resolution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that was it. It&amp;#39;s still baffling to me how difficult life must be for the guy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2urem', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'ixl4ps', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'is-now-wayne', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 19, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/ixl4ps/severe_case_of_social_anxiety/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/ixl4ps/severe_case_of_social_anxiety/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 208602, 'created_utc': 1600772136.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'talesfromcallcenters', 'selftext': 'So I’ve been working for this tech company customer service you don’t have to have crazy tech cexperience($15/hr, mehh there’s many ways to promote though)\nThe training was pretty intense six weeks long and you get dropped if you miss more than eight hours.

For what it\'s worth, I\'m with tech support.\n\nOften in the middle of questioning a customer to gather understanding about their issue or while troubleshooting, I\'d get this quite irritating remark from customers: ""blahblahblah can you help me, please?"" \n\nAnd it\'s so weird to me! Jesus, duh, I\'m already helping you aren\'t I? What did you think we\'ve been doing the entire time? No, seriously, enlighten me. If I wasn\'t helping you already, then seriously what do you think I\'ve been doing?\n\nI\'ve also noticed some people either can\'t read or stupidly decides not to read the entirety of my responses. So many times have they asked a question I\'ve literally just addressed in my previous response or two. So many times as well that I\'ve had to literally copy and paste what I had just sent seconds ago. Only then will they accept the answer.\n\nApparently there are also quite a large number of people who couldn\'t follow simple instructions. I could literally give step-by-step instructions and still they\'d ask, ""so should I do [some dumb shit they think they should do that is totally not what I suggested]"" No, dipshit, I just gave you instructions! Remove the catheter pissing your common sense away and follow the damn instructions!\n\nAnother fathoming case of this is when I request two pieces of information on the same message: their email and how their name appears on it. Often they\'d give me just one, usually just the email. I know I just have to ask again ""thanks, and how does your name appear on this email?"" But, seriously, why do I have to ask twice? I\'ve requested those two information in bullet format already so as to emphasize and yet... jesus!\n\nThen, there are still those who just don\'t understand verification. I just said I need your email and how your name appears under it. Then, they\'d go all aggro and question why it\'s necessary. I can\'t help it but boy do I want to pull a Big Smoke and just go ""ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS GIVE YOUR DAMN NAME (AND EMAIL), CJ!""\n\nThey then proceed to complain how we\'ve spent a good 20 minutes just going back and forth why I need these information when I could\'ve been helping them already. Well, like I said the last five fuckin\' times I can fuckin\' help you, cunt, just that I need your fuckin\' email and name first for verification which you could\'ve provided in less than a minute anyway! Instead you dragged this shit along!\n\nThen there are those who just can\'t accept the resolution they\'re given. I can\'t imagine how fuckin\' spoiled and privileged these people must be with their lives in general.

For what it&amp;#39;s worth, I&amp;#39;m with tech support.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Often in the middle of questioning a customer to gather understanding about their issue or while troubleshooting, I&amp;#39;d get this quite irritating remark from customers: &amp;quot;blahblahblah can you help me, please?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#39;s so weird to me! Jesus, duh, I&amp;#39;m already helping you aren&amp;#39;t I? What did you think we&amp;#39;ve been doing the entire time? No, seriously, enlighten me. If I wasn&amp;#39;t helping you already, then seriously what do you think I&amp;#39;ve been doing?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve also noticed some people either can&amp;#39;t read or stupidly decides not to read the entirety of my responses. So many times have they asked a question I&amp;#39;ve literally just addressed in my previous response or two. So many times as well that I&amp;#39;ve had to literally copy and paste what I had just sent seconds ago. Only then will they accept the answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently there are also quite a large number of people who couldn&amp;#39;t follow simple instructions. I could literally give step-by-step instructions and still they&amp;#39;d ask, &amp;quot;so should I do [some dumb shit they think they should do that is totally not what I suggested]&amp;quot; No, dipshit, I just gave you instructions! Remove the catheter pissing your common sense away and follow the damn instructions!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another fathoming case of this is when I request two pieces of information on the same message: their email and how their name appears on it. Often they&amp;#39;d give me just one, usually just the email. I know I just have to ask again &amp;quot;thanks, and how does your name appear on this email?&amp;quot; But, seriously, why do I have to ask twice? I&amp;#39;ve requested those two information in bullet format already so as to emphasize and yet... jesus!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, there are still those who just don&amp;#39;t understand verification. I just said I need your email and how your name appears under it. Then, they&amp;#39;d go all aggro and question why it&amp;#39;s necessary. I can&amp;#39;t help it but boy do I want to pull a Big Smoke and just go &amp;quot;ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS GIVE YOUR DAMN NAME (AND EMAIL), CJ!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They then proceed to complain how we&amp;#39;ve spent a good 20 minutes just going back and forth why I need these information when I could&amp;#39;ve been helping them already. Well, like I said the last five fuckin&amp;#39; times I can fuckin&amp;#39; help you, cunt, just that I need your fuckin&amp;#39; email and name first for verification which you could&amp;#39;ve provided in less than a minute anyway! Instead you dragged this shit along!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there are those who just can&amp;#39;t accept the resolution they&amp;#39;re given. I can&amp;#39;t imagine how fuckin&amp;#39; spoiled and privileged these people must be with their lives in general.

She called me a prostitute (she liked that word) multiple times and insulted me as I tried to bring her back to her grievance with our store. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was clearly mentally disturbed; I could tell by her voice it wasn’t a prank. I wanted to hang up but since every once and while she talked about our store, I couldn’t. Over and over I was berated for being a cheap whore. Eventually the call ended. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was that it? Nah. Within an hour she called again... and I GOT HER. These are randomized calls every time, so the likelihood of that is small in such a large center. Plus, when you call, you’ve got a long list of options before you even connect to someone. She went through long annoying options menus TWICE to call a random person a prostitute for doing her husband. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget that lady and while i was laughing the whole time at the absurdity of it, I hope she got some help... or became an actress because DAMN what a performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2urem', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'iw5h3o', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'allusernamestaken-1', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 1, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/iw5h3o/maam_this_is_a_supermarket/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromcallcenters/comments/iw5h3o/maam_this_is_a_supermarket/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 208602, 'created_utc': 1600568010.0, 'num_crossposts': 0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}}, {'kind': 't3', 'data': {'approved_at_utc': None, 'subreddit': 'talesfromcallcenters', 'selftext': ""I work in an outbound call center at home at the moment. \n\nIn 2 weeks I've been told 5 times to log off for the day, saying I got ETO'd and to log on the next day to try again because I didn't meet the quota they set.\n\nIssue is their computers are trash.
